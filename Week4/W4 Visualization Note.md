## W4 - Interactivity and Explainability

This week's topic is on the role of interactivity in data visualization as well as tools to improve the explainability of analysis.

Let's start by introducing some readings on interactivity:

- A classic paper conceptualizing the role of interaction: [Toward a Deeper Understanding of the Role of Interaction in Information Visualization.](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~stasko/4460/Reading/yi-tvcg07.pdf) Yi et al. 2007. 
- A detailed paper on the taxonomy of interactive visual analysis: [Interactive Dynamics for Visual Analysis.](http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2146416&type=pdf) Heer & Shneiderman. 2012.
- A recent paper on knowledge generation with visual analytics: [Knowledge Generation Model for Visual Analytics.](https://www.bckwon.com/pdf/kgva.pdf) Sacha et al. 2014. 
- Debates on whether interactivity helps:
	- [The death of interactive infographics?](https://medium.com/@dominikus/the-end-of-interactive-visualizations-52c585dcafcb) Dominikus Baur. 2017.
	- [In Defense of Interactive Graphics.](https://www.vis4.net/blog/2017/03/in-defense-of-interactive-graphics/) Gregor Aisch. 2017.

The goal of interactivity, along with many other aspects of visualization and visualization tool design, is to facilitate the human experience with data exploration, empower people to discover deeper insights, and tell better stories. Thus, the explainability of findings is an important consideration when designing visualization.

One way to improve explainability is to allow readers to be **active** and explore the concepts for themselves. Below are two websites that build the idea into interactive stories.

- [Explorable Explanations by Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations)
- [Explorable Explanations by Nicky Case](http://explorableexplanations.com)

In particular, I like this [explorable explanation on dynamic segregation model](https://ncase.me/polygons/). Imagine we create an interactive interface like this page, but based on the layout of actual geospatial distribution of different ethnic groups in NYC in history. Not to mention the idea of moving residents between groups connect to the definition of dissimilarity index *D*, which is a topic explored by the HRL team last fall. 

When reading through the papers and posts, please pay attention to **how they utilize interactivity** to amplify cognition and think about how we can transfer such design to the exploration and explanation of **the datasets at the HRL**. 

Last but not least, proactive visual data exploration is an emerging research topic. The main idea is to exploit the computational power of machines to look for hidden insights in the dataset, and suggest them to human users to investigate in more depth. This process of automatic knowledge discovery often involves elements of machine learning, as well as cognitive modeling of human users. Below are two related papers for your references: 

- [DataSite - Proactive visual data exploration with computation of insight-based recommendations.](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/DataSite%3A-Proactive-visual-data-exploration-with-of-Cui-Badam/d152eb5884c50d7b898c92e2a96e773f9cfaf887) Cui et al. 2019.
- [InsideInsights - Integrating Data-Driven Reporting in Collaborative Visual Analytics.](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/InsideInsights%3A-Integrating-Data%E2%80%90Driven-Reporting-Mathisen-Horak/e64bcef159629e960a29aa6e89f3003aa9b953fa) Mathisen et al. 2019.

The point of having proactive AI-powered recommendations is not to take the job of exploration away from human researchers, but to encourage us to look broader and go deeper. You can think of the process as a conversation between the machine and user, where the Human-Computer interaction facilitates better data exploration.

## Next Steps

By now we have come to the end of the first phase. In the past three weeks, we have surveyed topics in basic visualization theory, data preparation, special data, and interactivity. The goal of the first phase is to get us all on the same page, in terms of what tools and sources are available. For the coming month, you will work on a project to put your skills into practice and gain more knowledge in the field. There are several general directions: 

- Basic visualization theory
- Geospatial data visualization
- Natural language processing for textual data

Please let me know of your thoughts and preferences by setting up a meeting with me **by next Monday July 5th**. Feel free to propose a 30 minute time slot [on this page](http://calendly.com/nyutimwu/30min).
