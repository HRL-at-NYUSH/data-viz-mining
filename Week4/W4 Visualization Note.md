## W4 - Interactivity and Explainability

This week's topic is on the role of interactivity in data visualization as well as tools to improve explainability of analysis.

Let's start by introducing some readings on interactivity:

- A classic paper conceptualizing the role of interaction: [Toward a Deeper Understanding of the Role of Interaction in Information Visualization.](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~stasko/4460/Reading/yi-tvcg07.pdf) Yi et al. 2007. 
- A detailed paper on the taxonomy of interactive visual analysis:[Interactive Dynamics for Visual Analysis.](http://portal.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=2146416&type=pdf) Heer & Shneiderman. 2012.
- A recent paper on knowledge generation with visual analytics:[Knowledge Generation Model for Visual Analytics.](https://www.bckwon.com/pdf/kgva.pdf) Sacha et al. 2014. 
- Debates on whether interactivity helps:
	- [The death of interactive infographics?](https://medium.com/@dominikus/the-end-of-interactive-visualizations-52c585dcafcb) Dominikus Baur. 2017.
	- [In Defense of Interactive Graphics.](https://www.vis4.net/blog/2017/03/in-defense-of-interactive-graphics/) Gregor Aisch. 2017.

The goal of interactivity, along with many other aspects of visualization and visualization tool design, is to facilitate the human experience with data exploration, empower people to discover deeper insights and tell better stories. Thus, the explainability of findings are also important consideration when choosing visualization and presenting the results.
