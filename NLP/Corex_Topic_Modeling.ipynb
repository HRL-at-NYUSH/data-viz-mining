    "CorEx is a discriminative model, whereas LDA is a generative model. This means that while LDA outputs a probability distribution over each document, CorEx instead estimates the probability a document belongs to a topic given that document's words. As a result, the probabilities across topics for a given document do not have to add up to 1. The estimated probabilities of topics for each document can be accessed through log_p_y_given_x or p_y_given_x.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Topic Models The labels attribute gives the binary topic expressions for each document and each topic. We can use this output as input to another CorEx topic model to get latent representations of the topics themselves. This yields a hierarchical CorEx topic model. Like the first layer of the topic model, one can determine the number of latent variables to add in higher layers through examination of the topic TCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchored CorEx is an extension of CorEx that allows the \"anchoring\" of words to topics. When anchoring a word to a topic, CorEx is trying to maximize the mutual information between that word and the anchored topic. So, anchoring provides a way to guide the topic model towards specific subsets of words that the user would like to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchoring a single set of words to a single topic. This can help promote a topic that did not naturally emerge when running an unsupervised instance of the CorEx topic model. For example, one might anchor words like \"snow,\" \"cold,\" and \"avalanche\" to a topic if one suspects there should be a snow avalanche topic within a set of disaster relief articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchoring single sets of words to multiple topics. This can help find different aspects of a topic that may be discussed in several different contexts. For example, one might anchor \"protest\" to three topics and \"riot\" to three other topics to understand different framings that arise from tweets about political protests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anchoring different sets of words to multiple topics. This can help enforce topic separability if there appear to be chimera topics. For example, one might anchor \"mountain,\" \"Bernese,\" and \"dog\" to one topic and \"mountain,\" \"rocky,\" and \"colorado\" to another topic to help separate topics that merge discussion of Bernese Mountain Dogs and the Rocky Mountains."
