       " 'Author of \"Practical Treatise on the Steel Sojmrk,\" \"Modern Carpentry,*\\' \"Hardwood Finisher, Wood-Carving,\" Etc., Etc. ',\n",
       " 'In preparing this work, I think it unnecessary to waste time and space in publishing a preface, which would at least occupy from three to five pages, and which at best, would be of little service to my readers ; so I will content myself, and perhaps serve my readers better by inserting in these remarks the gist of what would be expected to appear in a preface, along with other material that may be both interesting and useful. ',\n",
       " 'In these days, specialization in \"Furniture-making\" has in a great measure robbed the trade of many of its charms, as well as its claims to the dignified position it once held. ',\n",
       " 'In the \"good old times\" every man who could hold up his head and say truthfully \"I am a CabinetMaker,\" meant that he had given long years of apprenticeship to every branch and every detail of the business. His assertion, when interpreted, meant \"that he could take timber, saw it, plane it, mould it, glue it, veneer it, join it, carve it, finish it, and upholster it, all by hand.\" It meant a full knowledge of everything connected with the manufacture from the entrance to the yard and to that of the wareroom. What might be expected of such workmen, in the way of completeness ',\n",
       " 'and thoroughness, could be had for the hiring. Their experience was indelibly stamped upon their work. ',\n",
       " 'Invention has disarranged this most certainly. The labor-saving machinery of later years has dispensed with something of the old-time necessity. Circular saws, jig and band saws, stickers, planers, jointers, carvers, and the many contrivances, for economizing time, have made those long terms of apprenticeship in a measure, unnecessary, and to-day men are not Cabinet-Makers in the sense we have referred to, but they are competent to do either circular-sawing, band-sawing, moulding, or planing, etc., alone, and but little else. This subdivision of labor has been the outgrowth of the advance of invention. ',\n",
       " 'Often you will have among your applicants for work, men who belong to both classes — representatives of the \"old school\" as it were, and fledgelings who, having rubbed furniture three months in some manufactory, and consider themselves fit subjects for a diploma. It will be found to be advantageous to mix these two elements. Each has claims which are worthy of consideration. The former class, from having been drilled so faithfully in every department of the work; although, workmen of this class are apt to be wedded a little too firmly to the methods in use when they were apprentices. Workmen of the latter kind are progressive, and restless under restraint; perhaps a little too much so sometimes. But the two average well, and the ',\n",
       " 'The bench hands, bear in mind, must be men of experience, with this quality more or less extended as the quality of the work may require. In cases where most of the work is machine work, the manufacturer will readily perceive that he can, with advantage to himself, engage the services of a class of men whose knowledge is confined exclusively to the machine they pledge themselves to run. Migratory workmen are a curse to themselves and the manufacturer. They are the best examples of the saying: \"A rolling stone gathers no moss.\" ',\n",
       " 'The close subdivision of work in our best manufactories is conducive to uniform and generally good results, that is, that the tools and machines produced are of equable quality and uniform in build. ',\n",
       " 'The system that includes the individual workman only as the intelligent part of the machinery is admirable as making him an exact reproducing agent, and consequently aiding in uniform results ; but it is to be questioned whether it is the best plan to make intelligent practical machines. It may be that possible excellence by it will be sacrificed to tolerable uniformity. Good mechanics of fifty-five years ago have little sympathy with a system that lowers the status of mechanical conditions to the level of the machine attendant, or the monotonous worker at a single branch. This system is ',\n",
       " \"not consonant with the freedom of individual endeavour that seems to be a part of the American mechanics' aspirations. \",\n",
       " 'After all the old-time job shop was about as reasonable a school as the embryo mechanic could desire. The foreman of one of the best known establishments in this country recently died. In conversation long ago he stated that his intimate knowledge of the different departments of the work was got from his experience in a \"job shop,\" where he had a chance at everything, from the lathe to the carving room. He made his own drawings (sketches), and frequently made his own designs. These accomplishments may have been crude, but they gave him the idea of how a job should be done, as well as what was to be accomplished. He was an example of one sort of a practical mechanic, of which there should be more. ',\n",
       " 'Since the grand art movement, of which Victor Hugo\\'s \"Notre-Dame de Paris\" was the most brilliant expression, the taste for art objects has gradually developed with an intensity almost incredible. The stuffs, the china-ware, and above all the furniture of preceding centuries, are, now that they are old and battered, always sold for prices far higher, because of their excellence of construction and design. In this tendency it would be wrong to see nothing but a single fashion, a mania and an exaggeration, based upon fantasy and imitation; all the men of taste of one nation, ',\n",
       " 'or, we might well say, of all great nations in the world, could not possibly be deceived to this extent, and with this unanimity of their fantasy, had it not a solid and serious basis. And this fashion for antique furniture does not rest upon a very reasonable and very logical foundation, — at first in its disdain for phantom furniture, which, through the perfecting of wood-working machines, has arrived at the last degrees of veneer, scarcely presenting the slightest degree of solidity, the mahogany, oak, walnut, and rose-wood with which they are coated cracking at the slightest shock, and peeling off at the least change in the dampness or dryness of the weather. All the world, too, knows equally well that the homely furniture of thirty years ago, Queen Anne and Eastlake, is equally inelegant in appearance, and uncomfortable in use. There is, then, in the desire of purchasing antique furniture, the just idea of procuring articles altogether solidly built, the form of which is always, if not absolutely conformable to the rules of art, at least entirely different from the veneer articles which, from their nature, can only be subject to very limited number of combinations, and can never furnish to the taste of architects and designers the same resources as solid wood. A longing to escape from the cold and monotonous furniture of the preceding generation added to the renaissance movement of the year of 1800, caused a greedy demand for antique furniture to suddenly arise ; but when all of those arti',\n",
       " 'cles which had remained sound and solid were sold off, it was necessary to repair, restore, and strengthen those articles which were only discovered in fragments. ',\n",
       " 'While the introduction of machinery had had much to do with changing the character and working methods of the cabinet maker, it has proved a great boon to humanity generally, and has given to the masses, a class of furniture they never could have enjoyed but for the cheaper productions by the aid of power, and machines, and in these remarks, I do not wish to give the impression that machine made furniture is not good, or that it has not a beauty of its own, or that a majority of the designs are not graceful and well adapted to the days in which it was executed. In fact, I am of the belief that woodworking machinery has proved a blessing to both producer and user of cabinet work, while at the same time it has proved almost fatal to the distinctive and individual beauty of artistic handmade furniture. ',\n",
       " 'The object of the writer of this book, is to aid the young cabinet-maker — and the old one too — in obtaining a knowledge of the art from A to Z, and to enable him to take his material from the rough, and work it up until it reaches a finished state ready to take the place for which it was intended. I also purpose reproducing a number of designs of, what was generally considered to be some of the finest examples of furniture, from which the young workman and designer, may absorb inspiration and give to his work a charm ',\n",
       " 'and character to such work as he may undertake to execute, that can never be conveyed to articles made by the machine. ',\n",
       " \"It may be said, and with justice, that there is little or no demand for handmade art furniture, but I am persuaded this condition is occasioned because of the little of it there is jn the market, and the very high prices demanded for it by the owners. These high prices are placed on the articles, not by the maker, designer or workman, but by dealers, and the prices are often from four to five times the actual cost of the original work, and are only bought by rich people, whereas, if the prices were normal, the middle classes, whos'e taste is equal — and often superior — to that of the very rich, would indulge in handmade work to a very much larger extent than they now do. \",\n",
       " 'The bright sharp workman, of whom there are hundreds in our cabinet factories, who have been trained from the lumber yards to the running of the most delicate machinery in the shop, who by a little study, and a little practical work, may soon become able to make and finish furniture — by hand — of the finest sort, furniture too, that will find a ready market if the maker does his best. Many fine pieces of furniture have been made by advanced students after work-hours or during holidays. I have in mind at this writing, a splendid oak side-board, that was made in Newark, N. J., by a young man who was serving some years in a furniture ',\n",
       " \"shop, in that city, as an apprentice. The work was all done by hand, and in a shed in the rear of the house, polishing and all. The sideboard was intended for his father, but a wealthy neighbor of the latter, a man of taste, seeing the work before it was quite completed, offered to buy it, and thus, when finished was sold for the sum of $280.00. The materials, including mirrors, stained and leaded glass, hardware, and other stuff, all told, cost about $55.00. When it is considered, the work was done, nearly all after hours, between the fifteenth of October and the end of April, the amount was quite a comfortable addition to the young man's slender yearly salary. But the money gained, was but a fraction of the benefit he derived, as the experience, and the knowledge obtained in making the furniture, were worth to him many times the money he received for it. \",\n",
       " 'Of course, I do not think every apprentice, or even a large percentage of them, could make such pieces of furniture, or find purchasers for them after they were made, but every apprentice or student could make something, that would be useful and ornamental, and have a cash value, besides opening a way for the cultivation of a broader and more exact artistic taste. ',\n",
       " 'Taste was the founder of all our styles in furniture from the prehistoric log stool all the way down through the Egyptian, Babylonian, Chinese, Greek, Roman, Medieval, Byzantine, French, Gothic and the more ',\n",
       " 'modern styles of Chipendale, Shereton, Adams, and our colonial styles, and it is essential that every cabinetmaker who aspires to know his business, should cultivate taste, make himself conversant with the various styles, and be able at a glance to tell to what style, or on what lines any given piece of furniture is intended to represent. ',\n",
       " 'In this connection, I may say, it is proposed to lay before my readers a chapter or two on the various styles of furniture, with illustrations, explanations and some details. It is also intended to offer some instructions for performing such work as gilding, staining, polishing, and finishing the work complete. ',\n",
       " \"There are but a few books of value, on the art of cabinet-making, available to the American reader, though in French, and German, and even in Italian, there are quite a number, but most of their renderings would be of little use to the English or American workman, however, I will try and cull from them, whatever I deem suitable to these pages. The cullings from these works will consist mostly of illustrations, representing some of the best works of French, Italian, and German masters, with such explanations as may be necessary. The only American work, of a real practical nature, that I have any knowledge of is, first, Cabinet-maker's Companion, by J. Stokes, published by Henry Carey Baird, Philadelphia, Pa., 1870. This is an excellent little work and contains quite a number of good re\",\n",
       " 'ceipts on dyeing, staining, and other useful matter. Another book, a still more modern one by Alvan Crocker Nye, Ph. B. and deals nearly altogether with the constructional principle of cabinet-making, but it has little to say regarding the styles or historical peculiarities of furniture. This book is published by Wm. Comstock, New York, and is dated 1900. Some other Manuals are very good in their way, but they are written chiefly for boys who have had little or no experience in woodworking, and who may not intend making Cabinet-making a life work, are suited more for amateur workers rather than for those intending to follow woodworking for a living. These manuals however, will prove useful to every one who intends to work in wood, either professionally or a,s an amateur. ',\n",
       " 'There have been many essays on the art of furniture making, in our journals and art magazines, but these have generally been of an academic character, with a few exceptions, and have proved but of little service to the practical workman. ',\n",
       " 'A brief history of furniture and its growth, may not be out of place, though I do not purpose going into the subject at great length, so I will devote one illustrated chapter only to it. ',\n",
       " 'The first well-known reference to woodwork is to be found in the Book of Genesis in the instructions given to Noah to make an Ark of \"Gopher Wood,\" to make a window, to pitch it within and without with pitch, and to observe definite measurements. From the specific directions thus handed down to us we may gather that mankind had acquired at a very early period of the World\\'s history a knowledge of the different kinds of wood, and the use of the various tools. ',\n",
       " \"We know also, from the various bas-reliefs and papyri to be found in the World's museums, how advanced were the Old Egyptians in the arts of civilization, and that the manufacture of comfortable and even luxurious furniture was well known. It is quite evident the Hebrews must have had the best of workmen for their teachers and taskmasters to have enabled them to acquire sufficient skill and experience to carry out such precise instructions as were given for the building of the ark, and the erection of the Tabernacle, the latter of which was built some 1 500 years before Christ — as to the kinds of wood, measurements, ornaments, fastenings (loops and taches), curtains of linen, and coverings of dried skins. We have only to turn for \",\n",
       " 'a moment to the 25th chapter of Exodus to be convinced that all the directions there mentioned were given to a people who had considerable experience in the methods of carrying out work, which must have resulted from some generations of cabinet-makers, carpenters, joiners, weavers, dyers, goldsmiths, and other craftsmen. ',\n",
       " 'A thousand years before Christ, we have those descriptions of the building and fitting by Solomon of the glorious work of his reign, the great temple, and of his own, \"the King\\'s house,\" which gathered from different countries the most skilful artificers of the time, an event which marks an era of advance in \\'the knowledge and skill of those who were thus brought together to do their best work towards carrying out the grand scheme. It is worth while, too, when we are referring to Old Testament information bearing upon the subject, to notice some details of furniture which are given, with their approximate dates as generally accepted, not because there is any particular importance attached to the precise chronology of the events concerned but because, speaking generally, they form landmarks in the history of furniture. One of these is the verse (2 Kings chap, lv) which tells us the contents of the \"little chamber in the wall,\" when Elisha visited the Shunamite, about B. C. 895; and we are told of the preparations for the reception of the prophet: \"And let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool ',\n",
       " 'and a candlestick.\" Another incident is some 420 years later, when, in the allusion to the grandeur of the Palace of Ahasuerus, we catch a glimpse of Eastern magnificence in the description of the drapery which furnished the apartment: \"Where were white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple, to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble.\" (Esther 1:6). ',\n",
       " 'There are, unfortunately, no trustworthy descriptions of ancient Hebrew furniture. The illustrations in Kitto\\'s Bible, Mr. Henry Soltau\\'s \"The Tabernacle, The Priesthood and the Offerings,\" and other similar books, are apparently drawn from imagination, founded on descriptions in the Old Testament. In these, the \"table for shew-bread\" is generally represented as having legs partly turned, with the upper portions square, to which rings were attached for the poles by which it was carried. As a nomadic people, their furniture would be but primitive, and we may take it that as the Jews and Assyrians came from the same stock, and spoke the same language, such ornamental furniture as there was would, with the exception of the representations of figures of men or of animals, be of a similar character. At least this is what Litchfield says, and he is no mean authority. ',\n",
       " 'Doubtless prehistoric men made use of stones, logs, or piled-up sods, for seats, and for spots to rest their ',\n",
       " 'heads ; the use of stones for pillows being quite common as late as early historic times. Be this as it may however, we find, the Egyptians had chairs, beds, tables and other furniture, some of which was highly wrought and ornamented, at least 4000 years before Christ, as shown by the monuments, and by the papyri that have come down to us. We also possess some fragments of bronze furniture of both Egyptian and Assyrian make. ',\n",
       " 'The British Museum and the Louvre contain a few Egyptian chairs or seats that have been made in ebony and ivory, which owe their preservation to the lasting nature of the material. ',\n",
       " \"Two Egyptian chairs or thrones are illustrated at Figs. 1 and 2, in the first part of this work. At Fig. 3, cabinet-makers are represented as occupied in chair making, the feet and legs of the chairs being designed from animals' limbs, and the stools on which the workmen are sitting are blocks of wood hollowed out at the top. The Egyptian couch was of a straight-lined design in the body with a curved head like an ordinary sofa, the legs, feet and other salient points being carved with heads, feet and tails of animals. \",\n",
       " 'Some boxes and coffers with gable tops dovetailed together, small toilet boxes having carved or painted decoration, and Mummy cases of cedar-wood having elaborate hieroglyphic decorations, may be seen in the British Museum and in the Louvre. Chariot and horse furniture are well represented in the reliefs and wall ',\n",
       " 'paintings. Egypt was famed for chariot building, and exported them in trade to the surrounding nations. We read that King Solomon imported his war-chariots from Egypt. ',\n",
       " 'If examples of Egyptian furniture are scarce, the furniture of Assyria is practically non-existent, as the climate of the latter country was not so dry or preservative as that of Egypt, so that all examples thathave not been wilfully destroyed have long ago perished. Many ornaments of bronze and of ivory decorations have been discovered that have been used as mountings to feet, ends of legs of seats, chairs, or thrones. The ',\n",
       " 'bas-reliefs of the latter enables us to form a fairly accurate judgment of the nature and style of Assyrian furniture, the decoration of which was of a heavier and coarser character than that of the more elegant Egyptian ( Fig. 4 and 5 ) . Forms and parts of animals ',\n",
       " 'were used by the Assyrians and nearly all Oriental nations as furniture decorations. The human figure was also used, but generally in the representation of slaves or conquered peoples, who were degraded to the position of bearing the weight of the seat or throne of the monarch. The Egyptian chairs had also carved human figures as captives tied under the seat. ',\n",
       " \"The furniture of the Hebrews was doubtless of the same kind as the Assyrian. From the description of King Solomon's throne it was apparently similar to those of the Assyrian kings. It had lions for the arm supports, and had six lions in gold and ivory on the six steps on either side of the throne. \",\n",
       " 'In the manufacture of the furniture of the nations of antiquity the principal materials were — in woods, ebony, rosewood, walnut, pine, teak, and, above all, cedarwood; ivory, gold, silver, bronze, and electrum were also much used for inlays and for solid mountings. ',\n",
       " 'The furniture and the chariots of the Greeks in their early period were simply copied from Egyptian and Asiatic sources, with less of the animal forms and more of plant forms as decorative details (Figs. 6, 7). Folding stools and chairs were made in wood and in metal and the backs of the chairs Fl ^ re 4 were upright, or nearly so ',\n",
       " '(Figs. 8, 9 and 10) ; couches resembling modern sofas, elaborate foot-stools, and arm-chairs with the sphinxes for the arms were made by the Greeks. ',\n",
       " 'In the British Museum are some small models of Greek chairs made in lead, and wooden boxes showing the dovetail construction. ',\n",
       " 'In the later Greek periods the furniture was inlaid with ivory, ebony, gold, and silver. Tripods were made of bronze, and had ornamented legs in the shapes of the limbs of lions, leopards, and sphinxes. The Roman bronze tripods were very similar to the Grecian ones ',\n",
       " 'in design, and were not only used for sacred purposes in the temples, but also to support braziers for heating purposes, or for burning perfumes in the houses of private people (Fig. 10). ',\n",
       " 'Hand-mirrors and cistae were made in great quantities in bronze or in other metal alloys, in silver, and ',\n",
       " 'sometimes in gold. The mirrors were polished on the face, and had often rich designs of figure subjects. The Greek cistae were cylindrical metal boxes that rested on feet designed from those of various animals, having a lid or cover, with a handle or knot usually of figure design, the whole surface of the body being covered with engraved figure compositions and ornamental borders. They were probably used to contain jewelry ',\n",
       " 'and trinkets. Some very fine specimens of these handmirrors and cistae may be seen in the British Museum. ',\n",
       " 'The furnishing of the houses of the Romans was very much of the same character as that of the Greeks ',\n",
       " 'The interior plan and aspects of the Roman houses were such as those of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Tables and tripods of bronze or braziers were supported ',\n",
       " 'on three legs, some of which were made with hinges for folding purposes (Fig. n), and others were of sphinx and animal forms of a rich design (Fig. 12). Lamp-stand designs were quaint and elegant and were ',\n",
       " 'made in bronze (Fig. 13). Candelabra of architectural design were carved in marble and were from six to ten feet in height (Fig. 15). ',\n",
       " 'The Romans highly prized and paid good sums for tables that were made from the pollard cross grain of different hard woods in which the knots and grain showed to advantage, the beauty of the wood being brought out by hand-polishing and by the staining it ',\n",
       " \"with various colored dyes. Bird's eye maple and the wood of the cedrus atlantica were much prized. The smaller tables, abaci, rested usually on one foot— monopodium — and larger tables had three or four legs, \",\n",
       " 'which had ivory claws or heads of animals as carved decoration (Fig. 14). Boxwood, beech, and palm, inlaid with ivory, ebony, and precious metals, were used in the materials of chairs and couches. The latter were often made in bronze (Figs. 15 and 16), and chairs of state were carved in marble, one of this kind being in the Louvre, a cast of which is now in the Kensington Museum (Fig. 17). The form of the Roman curule chair was like the letter X, and was so called because it ',\n",
       " \"could be folded and carried easily in the curules or chariots. It was used from the earliest times of the Romans down to modern days in Italy, and was often constructed of elephants' tusks, wood, or metal, with ivory feet. The curule chairs were carried about for outdoor use and for the theatre. The sella or bisellium. \",\n",
       " 'to seat two persons, was often a very ornate kind of seat with turned legs similar to the couches (Fig. 18). ',\n",
       " 'In the houses of the Romans a separate room or wardrobe was fitted up to keep the dresses and cloths of the family ; this room had cupboards with doors and shelves, drawers, and lockers. ',\n",
       " \"Portable coffers and chests were used, in which they packed their cloths and valuables when carrying them to and from their town and country houses. The Roman furniture and wooden construction of their houses were decorated with paintings and carvings of animals' heads, limbs, and feet, and with the usual architectural acanthus foliage — veneering of woods was an art in which the Romans were skilled; both large and small design in Tazsia work were the chief decorations of the best furniture. \",\n",
       " 'The representations we have of what was used by the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans, are those only of the most finished and tasteful specimens; and, consequently, materials do not exist for the formation of a chronological series. But if we examine such as are of subsequent date in Europe, the reply will be found amply to repay the trouble. ',\n",
       " 'In endeavoring to obtain some little insight into the forms and materials of the furniture of ancient times, we are dependent on different sources, according to the country under consideration. If it be ancient Rome or Greece, the descriptions by the classical writers and the paintings at Pompeii are our chief authorities; if ancient Egypt, the paintings on the walls at Thebes and other places ; if in China or India, or Asia generally, the specimens still existing, for the Asiatics are more stationary in their usages than the inhabitants of any other quarter of the globe. Footstools seemed to have formed part of the furniture of a sitting-room; ',\n",
       " 'they were made both solid and open at the sides, and were covered at the top with leather or interlaced string. ',\n",
       " 'The distinction between a bed and a couch does not seem to have been very clearly marked. They had couches of wood with one end raised and receding in a graceful curve, with feet fashioned to resemble those of some wild animal. It is supposed that those couches had a rich covering by day and bedding by night. The use of wooden pillows was customary ; they were made of various materials, according to the rank of the possessor, and had a singular kind of cavity in which the head or the back of the neck might rest. Wicker bedsteads were sometimes made of palmbranches, forming a light kind of grating on which the bed and bedding were placed. The tables used were of various forms — round, square and ob',\n",
       " 'lar, and supported by a central pillar, which was often the figure of a man as a captive. Other tables had three or four legs, and the material of the tables themselves, though generally wood, was sometimes metal or stone. ',\n",
       " 'It is curious to remark that Egypt exhibited, three or four thousand years ago, articles of furniture bearing a much closer resemblance to those of modern Europe than Egypt does at the present day. The chairs of the early times might in many cases be readily mistaken for those now in use among ourselves; whereas the divans and cushions of modern Egypt, on which the natives indolently recline, belong to the oriental system of furniture. In Cairo no chambers are furnished as bed-rooms. The bed, in the day-time, is rolled up and placed on one side, or in an adjoining closet, which is a sleeping-place in the winter. In summer many persons sleep upon the house-tops. The furniture of a room is comprised pretty nearly by the mat or carpet spread upon the floor, and the divans or cushioned couches. For meals a round tray is brought in and placed upon a low stool, and the company sit round it on the ground. There is no fire-place, the room being warmed when necessary by charcoal burning in a chafing-dish. ',\n",

       " 'The furniture, such as tables, chairs, beds, and the chariots of the Byzantine period, was like the architecture in having something of the classic Roman mixture with some Asiatic Greek forms in its design. Scarcely any remains of such are now in existence, although we have evidences of the extreme richness of the sumptuary furniture and vessels of the great houses and palaces of Constantinople, for owing to the decadence and destruction of the Roman empire in the provinces, the capital of the East became enriched by treasures of the Roman families, who naturally fled to Constantinople for protection for themselves and their valuable effects.

In the course of time they succeeded in founding the school of art known as Rhenish-Byzantine. The finest illustrations of this art are seen in the magnificent enamelled reliquaries or shrines. The giltbronze chair of Dagobert is of Romanesque design, and is one of the earliest pieces of furniture of the Middle Ages (see Fig. 19). Another mediaeval chair or throne is high seated, and exceedingly rich in design (Fig. 20). It is of Scandinavian origin, and is a good example of the Romanesque style of Northern Europe. Many forms of the Romanesque are seen in the furniture and carving of the Gothic style that immediately succeeded the former. ',\n",
       " 'During the Anglo-Saxon period in England the ordinary houses usually consisted of one room. Sometimes a shed-like structure was erected against the wall of the room to contain the bed of the mistress of the house, and as a rule the inmates slept on a large table placed in the center of the room, or on benches on which bags of straw were placed. Seats without backs, or stools, long settles or benches with backs and carved ends or arms, were the chief articles in furniture. ',\n",

       " 'In the early part of the fifteenth century and during the whole of the century the furniture of Europe generally was designed more or less on Gothic lines, but gradually the new forms that were now rapidly developing in the architecture of the Renaissance, but in a slower measure, began to assert themselves in furniture designs. Consequently, we find in many articles, such as armoires or presses, and cabinets, a mixture of style in the design — as, for instance, the upper panels would be in the Mediaeval, and the lower ones in the Renaissance style, or the general construction would be Gothic, and the details and decoration would be Italian. ',\n",
       " 'This was more often the case in the furniture and other art in Germany, where the Renaissance was tardily welcomed. ',\n",
       " 'Styles of design in furniture overlap each other so much, especially in the Renaissance period, that it became very difficult to assign a correct date to many pieces of important work. Gothic designs continued to be used during the sixteenth century, although the Renaissance had been developing for a hundred years ',\n",

The most authentic means of fixing the date is when certain work can be proved to have come from the hand of a particular artist, or when there is a record of its having been made for a king or some great person, for the style is not always a sure proof of the correct date. ',\n",
       " 'In the \"Quattrocento\" period (1400-1500), or fifteenth century, Italian furniture made for churches, palaces, or private houses, was usually decorated with paintings, sometimes on a gilt ground, which was prepared in a gesso material before the gold was applied, some parts of which had relief ornamentation. ',\n",
       " 'Reliquaries, altar-fronts, panels or cabinets, chests, and marriage coffers were decorated in this way. ',\n",
       " 'The work known as \"tarsia,\" or certosina work, was made in great perfection about this time in Italy. It is inlaid work of a geometric character in design, or is composed of floral ornament, and sometimes consists of representations of landscapes and buildings. This kind of inlay derived from Persian sources, was developed chiefly by the Venetians, and was used mostly by them in the decoration of their stalls, tables, chairs, cabinets, &c. Ebony, ivory, and metals were also employed in the Italian inlays of this period. ',\n",
       " 'The Italian cassoni, or marriage coffers, were the most ornate and most imposing articles of furniture of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. They were placed in the long halls and corridors of the palaces and great ',\n",

In the latter century they were carved in walnut with sculptural mythological subjects, and had endings or corners of half-figures and half-foliage, as caryatids, \",\n",
       " 'with feet designed from the claws of animals to raise them from the ground (Fig. 32). The carving was relieved by gilding in parts, and sometimes the whole of it was gilt. ',\n",
       " 'Other examples of an earlier date were covered with a finely modelled decoration of gesso work, and gilded, and in other cases the large panels in the front were painted with figure subjects in brilliant colors and heightened with gold. ',\n",

       " 'In the Kensington Museum there is an extensive collection of Italian cassoni embracing all the above varieties. Chairs carved and gilt of the same style and period as the coffers were usually placed between the rows of the latter in the halls of the Italian palaces (Fig. 33). These chairs had their backs and legs richly carved, each part being made out of a single slab of wood. ',\n",
       " 'The pair of bellows (Fig. 34) is a further illustration of the design and excellence of workmanship as shown in the work of the wood carvers of Italy in the sixteenth century, or \"Cinquecento\" period. ',\n",

       " 'Another form of chair of a rectangular character, with or without arms, having an embossed leather or velvet covering on the back and seat, with turned and carved legs and rails, was made in Italy about this time (Fig. 36) ; it was much used subsequently in Spain, France, and in England, and has continued to be in favor down to the present day.

       " \"In the reigns of Henry VII. and Henry VIII. in England the style gradually altered to the Italian forms of the Renaissance, and great quantities of Italian, Flemish, and French furniture were largely imported. Jean de Mabuse and Torrigiano were employed as architects and sculptors by Henry VII. , and Holbein and some Italian artists designed furniture and goldsmith's work for Henry VIII. \",\n",
       " 'In France, during the reigns of Francois I., Catherine de Medici, and Henry II., a great activity took place in architecture and in all the industrial arts, in which that country was not only imitated, but sought to excel, the work of the Italian schools. ',\n",
       " \"As already mentioned, the French kings and Medicean princesses in the sixteenth century had invited from Italy Cellini, Primaticcio, II Rosso, Serlio, and others, who succeeded in founding the style of the Renaissance in France, and about the same time many French artists journeyed to Italy to acquire the newer style which had been evolved from the study of the old classic remains of that country. Among the names of the principal French artists, sculptors, and carvers of this period are those of Jean Goujon, Nicholas Bachelier of Toulouse, Jean Cousin, Germain Pilon, Philibert de L'Orme, Du Cerceau, who published \",\n",
       " 'designs for all kinds of decorations and carvings, and Hugues Sambin of Dijon. Most of these men were ',\n",
       " 'architects and also designers of the heavy and rich furniture that was characteristic of the French Renaissance. Some of these artists and their works have been noticed in the chapters on Renaissance architecture and metal work. The cabinet (Fig. 37) is a good example of the architecturic style of French furniture of the sixteenth century. French wood carving is distinguished from the ',\n",
       " 'Italian of this period by the great use of the cartouche and strap-work (Fig. 38), which was so characteristic of the Henri-Deux style. ',\n",
       " 'When the Renaissance had taken a firm root in Germany, the designers and carvers of altar-pieces and of furniture generally proved themselves thorough masters of the style, and were especially skilful in the carving of wood, both on a gigantic and on a minute scale. Whole fronts of houses were elaborately carved in designs consisting of figure work, animals, ornament, and grotesques of a quaint and humorous description, while exceedingly minute works of figure subjects and animals were carved in box and other woods with a delicacy and quaintness often excelling the ivory carvings of the Japanese. Escritoires, buffets, cabinets, and other furniture, were made and exported from Germany into Spain and other countries. ',\n",
       " 'Flemish and English furniture and carving were pretty much alike in the reigns of Elizabeth — the Tudor period of English art — and of James L, the Stuart of Jacobean. The pieces of carved furniture, both Flemish and English, were very solid and heavy both in the design and thickness of material, which was generally of oak or chestnut. So much Flemish furniture was imported into England at this time, and the Englishmade work, being so close in resemblance to the former, that a great difficulty is experienced in classifying examples of this period. The table, Fig. 39, and the socalled \"Great Bed of Ware,\" are examples of the furniture of the Elizabethan period (Fig. 40). ',\n",
       " 'duced in the first instance by the great importations from Italy and Germany, but under such excellent native carvers and designers as Felipe de Borgona (six',\n",
       " 'teenth century), and Berruguete (i 480-1 561), the style of the Renaissance soon spread from Toledo to Seville and Valladolid, where great quantities of carved and inlaid work and elaborate altar-pieces were executed during the prosperous Spanish period of the sixteenth century. ',\n",
       " 'During the same century Venice and Florence were famed for their marquetry — inlaid work of ivory and metal — in cypres s, walnut, and other woods, which art ',\n",
       " 'had been imported from Persia and India by the Venetians, and which spread rapidly through Europe until the furniture made with marquetry decoration by degrees supplanted the heavier classical architectural designs. ',\n",
       " 'Before leaving the Italian sixteenth-century work we must notice the mirrors, with their elaborately carved frames of Venetian design and manufacture. In this century Venice was renowned for the making of glass, for which it is still famous, and certain privileges were granted by the State exclusively to Venetian manufacturers of looking-glasses. Two Murano glass makers named Andrea and Dominico, who were the inventors, were granted in the year 1507 the sole privilege of making \"mirrors of crystal glass\" for a term of twenty years. Previous to this time the mirrors ',\n",
       " 'were made of various polished metals. The frames of the Venetian mirrors were often elaborately carved (Fig. 41), some of them being made in designs that were strictly architectural in character, representing a door, or window frame, with pilasters frieze, and cornice and sill or plinth. These carved frames were often part or wholly gilt, and were exported in considerable quantities. Pictures were framed in a similar way to the mirrors, and carved and gilt frames were soon used all over Europe as picture frames. Later on gilt furniture of all kinds was made in Venice and was in great favor in the other countries of the Continent. ',\n",
       " 'The manufacture of marquetry furniture by the Dutch in the seventeenth century has been mentioned as having helped in a great measure to change the style of furniture design from its former architectural character to a greater simplicity of construction. Large panel surfaces were used for the purpose of showing to greater advantage the rich and bright colors of different kinds of hard woods used in the marquetry. Both natural and stained varieties of various wood were arranged in the designs in juxta-position, and a free and picturesque kind of ornamental foliage was employed mixed with large tulips, roses, and birds in the Dutch marquetry decoration. Other materials such as ivory, ebony, and mother-of-pearl, were also used as inlays. In France a similar kind of marquetry ',\n",
       " 'was developed, but the design consisted more of figure subjects and imitations of ruins in landscapes. A complete change in the design of the furniture in the latter country was also effected by the same desire to get large surface on which the inlaid work could be seen to great advantage, and the spaces were not divided by architectural mouldings, and the pilasters, as they had been in the preceding earlier work. Towards the end of the sixteenth century, and during the earlier half of the seventeenth, the sumptuous furniture, the beds, and general furnishing of the better class of houses and palaces in France and other European countries, were characterized by the use of costly silk brocades, tissues, and embroidered coverings and hangings. ',\n",
       " 'By thus seeking to give the furniture an appearance of the richest possible kind, such articles as chairs, couches, and beds lost in a corresponding degree their elegance and former constructive beauty. Under their gorgeous Italian and Oriental velvet coverings, their framed construction ceased to be visible. The above pieces of furniture still retained their sumptuous upholstery during the reign of Louis XIV., but the tables, armoires. cabinets, book-cases, pedestals, clock-stands ',\n",
       " \"and cases, came under the influence of the architecture of the period, when the king's chief minister, Colbert, selected the best architects and cabinet-makers of the day to design the furniture for the palaces of the Tuileries, the Louvre, and Fontainebleau. \",\n",
       " 'The greatest name connected with the design and manufacture of the magnificent furniture of the Louis',\n",
       " 'Quatorze period is that of Andre-Charles Boulle, whose work is known under his name as \"Boulle.\" This celebrated furniture is an elaborate kind of marquetry of which the materials are rare woods, ebony, tortoiseshell, brass, mother-of-pearl, and white metal or tin. The mountings, mouldings, and other salient points are made in brass beautifully chased and finished, some of the mouldings being in the forms of masks, foliages, cartouches, and animals\\' heads and feet as termination. Andre-Charles Boulle was born in Paris in the year ',\n",
       " \"1642. His father, Pierre Boulle was also a distinguished ebeniste, or cabinet-maker, but his more eminent son possessed the artistic gift in a much higher degree. In addition to making his special marquetry from his own designs Boulle also executed a good deal of his best works from the design of Jean Berain ( 1636171 1 ), his chief collaborateur. Berain's designs were more Italian in style, more symmetrical in the composition of the ornament, and more correct from an architectural point of view, than those attributed to Boulle himself, whose designs had much of the looseness and freedom of the prevalent Louis Ouatorze. \",\n",
       " \"At the death of Jean Mace, the king's ebeniste, in 1672, who had formerly lived in the royal galleries of the Louvre, the logement and office of ebeniste to the king had become vacant, and Boulle on the recommendation of Colbert, minister to Louis XIV., was appointed as the successor of Mace, and was installed in his rooms in the Louvre in the year 1673. He na< ^ previously executed some important work for the king, and was known as the ablest ebeniste at that time in Paris. \",\n",
       " 'The origin of the Boulle marquetry can be traced to the Indian, Persian, and Damascus encrusted inlays in ivory, ebony, and metal, that found their way to Venice, Portugal, Spain, and France in the Middle Ages. These works consisted chiefly of caskets, coffers, and small pieces of furniture In the inventories of ',\n",
       " 'Charles V. of France (1380) mention is made of lecterns and coffers of inlaid ivory or bone, in ebony, and similar works are mentioned in the inventories of Charles VI. (1418), and of Anne of Brittany (1498). These are the earliest notices of marquetry furniture that was made in France, and was probably an imitation of Oriental work. ',\n",
       " \"In the Renaissance period Francois I. bought some magnificent furniture of Indian workmanship, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, from Portuguese merchants, and mention is made of chairs, tables, coffers, cabinets, and mirror-frames that belonged to Queen Marie de Medicis (1600), the Cardinal d'Amboise (1500), and other great persons of the French Court, all of which works were made in marquetry. \",\n",
       " 'In France before the sixteenth century, tortoiseshell, brass, tin, and exotic woods were used as inlays, in addition to the ivory, ebony, and nacre of the East. From this it will be seen that Boulle did not invent the celebrated marquetry that bears his name. He, however, brought this sumptuous form of cabinet work to great perfection, and under the patronage of Louis XIV. he had every opportunity to develop his artistic abilities to the utmost. ',\n",
       " 'The method of procedure in the making of the Boulle marquetry was, first, to prepare the veneers of wood, shell, tin, and brass of the same thickness, each having perfectly plain surfaces; these veneers were ',\n",
       " 'then glued together in pairs of opposite materials, according to the nature of the effect required in the ',\n",
       " 'finished work, and were held together firmly in a vice. The design was then traced on the surface of the upper leaf, and the veneers were then cut through the lines of ',\n",
       " 'the pattern with a burin, a sharp strong knife, or a fine saw; thus four pieces of marquetry were made at one cutting. When the plaque forming the design was composed of tin or brass, which was afterwards engraved or chased, it was technically called \"boulle\" ; and when the design was formed by the shell or ebony it was called \"counter\"; the two effects are together known as \"boulle and counter\" or premiere et contrepartie. ',\n",
       " 'A later kind of Boulle work, known as the Second Style, has the shell veneers laid on a clouded vermilion or on a gilt ground. ',\n",
       " 'Boulle was an artist of great excellence as a sculptor and chaser of metals; his mountings of foliage and masks which decorated his works are spirited in design and are skilfully chased and finished (Fig. 42). He executed a great number of costly pieces of his famous marquetry for Louis XIV. and the Dauphin of France, many of which found their way to England a century later. Examples of Boulle work fetch great prices when, as on rare occasions, they make their appearance in a sale. ',\n",
       " 'In Germany in the seventeenth century, the most prominent names as designers and makers of furniture are Philip Heinhofer, Baumgartner, and Hans Schwanhard. The former was the maker of the celebrated Pomeranian Cabinet (1611-1617) which is now in the Royal Museum at Berlin. ',\n",

He worked with Le Brun, the painter and director of the decoration at Versailles. Le Brun\\'s own work was heavy and dull, although he aimed at grandeur and gorgeousness of effect. He was director of the Gobelins tapestry manufactory, and his style of work was in harmony with the pompous ideas of Louis the \"Grand Monarch.\" Madame de Maintenon says in one of her letters to a friend, that Louis was so fond of symmetry and stateliness in his architecture, as in other things, that he would have you \"perish in his symmetry,\" for he caused his doors and windows to be constructed in pairs opposite to one another, which gave to everybody who lived in his palaces their death of cold by draughts of air.

Ornament was carved with a singular crispness, and apparently without any hesitation on the part of the carver. Though we may condemn the florid looseness of the style of Gibbons, we must admire the dexterity of workmanship and general technical excellence imparted to everything he touched. Some of his best work may still be seen at Chatsworth, Petworth House in Sussex, Lyme Hall in Cheshire, St. Paul's Cathedral, and Trinity College Chapel at Oxford. \",\n",
       " \"Under the Regency of Philippe d'Orleans in France (17 1 5-1 723) decoration and ornament assumed a light and fanciful character, very naturalistic, but still having some classic details; of this style Claude Gillot is the chief exponent. Watteau, his pupil, made a great name as a painter of pastoral scenes, fetes galantes, and all kinds of light and daintily-treated subjects of a theatrical and artificial kind of composition. His color was silvery and harmonious, and sometimes he decorated furniture with pastoral scenes. \",\n",
       " 'The Rococo style had begun under the Regency, if not earlier, and such men as Oppenort, the De Cottes, father and son, Francois de Cuvillies, the Italians Bernini and Borromini, and lastly the great apostle of the Rococo, Meissonier, were all designers of furniture or architects who belonged to the period of Louis XV., and who executed works that reflected the loose and ',\n",
       " 'unrestrained character of the times (1723-1774). Chinese and naturalistic elements were grafted on, or mixed with, the former Louis Quatorze, with an addition of still life that did duty for architectural form in objects of pottery and metal work, and a combination of shell work; all these elements made up the style known under the different names of rococo, rocaille, baroque, or Louis Quinze.

       " 'Furniture was made with curved and swelling panels to show to more advantage the marquetry, or paintings on gold grounds ; these kinds of panels and friezes were known as \"bombe.\" ',\n",
       " 'It is said that the Italian architects, Bernini and Borromini, were the first to introduce the rococo style into France, but no designer went so far in the wilderness of its vagaries as the French Meissonier. His ornament furnishes a perfect example of the want of balance and symmetry. He designed for furniture, woodwork, silver-smithery, and modelled decoration, all of which work illustrated the broken shell-shaped panels with frilled and scalloped edgings and curved mouldings. ',\n",

It was quite likely that this was as near as possible a successful imitation of the Japanese gold lacquer that decorated the articles which were at this period imported from Japan by the Dutch and Portuguese traders into Europe. Carriages, tables, cabinets, and especially smaller articles like snuff-boxes and needle-cases, were painted and decorated in \"Vernis-Martin.\" Some of the smaller objects were beautifully mounted in chased gold.

A unique commode is illustrated at Fig. 47, made from panels of very old Japanese lacquer and highly decorated with ormoulu mounts by Caffieri, a skilled chaser of the Louis-Quinze period. ',\n",
       " 'In the latter half of the eighteenth century an improvement in the design of furniture and of ornament generally crept in, owing to the study of the ornamentation and design of the classic objects that had been found in the buried cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii.

Mouldings were fine and delicately ornamented and of straight line variety; in fact, the straight line now reasserted itself in architecture and furniture design (see Figs. 48, 49), in refreshing and healthy contrast to the tottering and riotous curves of Louis XV. and the Du Barry period. ',\n",
       " 'Some of the most beautiful furniture expressive of the utmost elegance was made by Riesner and David, and was decorated with ormoulu mounts by Gouthiere for the Queen Marie Antoinette. Riesner and Gouthiere were the ablest men of their time, who generally worked together in the making and decorating of the finest furniture of this period. There is in the Jones Collection at South Kensington some of the very finest examples of this furniture, much of which was made for Marie Antoinette (Figs. 50, 51). ',\n",

       " 'of this class of work. Prieur was also a good chaser of the Louis Seize period. Delafosse was an architect and designer of furniture and decoration of the period, whose designs were of a more heavy and classical kind. Cauvet was a German who worked in Paris, and designed graceful arabesques and figure work, and who published a book of designs. Lalonde designed work that might be classed in the same category as that of Cauvet, and Salembier was a prolific designer of a light and free kind of arabesque. Many of his designs for silk may be seen in the fabric at the Silk Museum in the Bourse at Lyons. Le Notre designed for furniture, carving, and was also famed with La Quintinie as a designer of the state and public gardens. ',\n",
       " 'In Italy the prevailing ornament in furniture and decoration was more classical than in France. Piranesi, Albertolli, Pergolese, and Bartolozzi are names of the principal designers of this country in the eighteenth century, most of whom published extensive works on ornament. The latter two were brought to England by the brothers John and Robert Adam (17281792), who had travelled in Italy, bringing also with them classical ideas, which they developed in England, and which influenced to a great extent the style of architecture and furniture design in this country. The Adelphi building and the houses in Portland Place were built from designs by the Adams. ',\n",

This return to the classic heaviness has been attributed to the influence of the academic painter David, but is more likely to have been a pandering to the national worship of Napoleon and the French Empire. It seemed to have been the universal desire to make everything echo or reflect in some measure the glory of the Emperor Napoleon I. The meanest thing had some symbol or allusion by the way of decoration that should remind everybody of the greatness of the new monarch and of the French Empire, and consequently the heavy and ponderous style of that period was known as the \"Empire Style.\" The furniture of the Empire was usually made in mahogany, decorated with mountings in brass or bronze, of sphinxes, griffins, Roman emblems, and antique scrollery.

Therefore when we read accounts of ancient furniture and its great superiority over that in use now, first see whence the authority comes before believing it all. We have seen accounts of the magnificence of the furniture of the Romans in the time of Constantine ; of the tables and chairs inlaid with gold, silver, and precious stones ; of ease and barbaric splendour that was startling; whereas the same chairs and tables were as uncouth and cumbersome and uncomfortable as most people believe them to be comfortable and elegant. They may have been heavy with gems, but the gems were beautiful — not the chairs. ',\n",

The furniture of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries had artistic merit and but little comfort, and was so rude in construction that the beauty of design was lost in the rough, unfinished look it presented, while today high finish, elegance of construction, and inviting look of comfort, do much to retard the introduction of pure architecture. When these two things, art and comfort, are combined, as they well may be, and soon will be, for we are glad to see the inclination in that way, it will be said years hence that the people of the nineteenth century were the first to turn out perfect furniture.

The mothers of the present day may, perhaps, feel interested in knowing what kind of article a cradle was about three centuries ago; it was a species of box, or coffer on rockers, decorated elaborately with carvings.

Fashion was of inestimable value. In some instances Fashion has been found capable of fixing a good moral order; and then of course it has been of worth still far more transcendant. But this brainless spirit, perhaps oftener has made bad taste immovable; of which the Chinese afford a great example. ',\n",

Can it be requisite — I fear it may — to superadd, that the furniture should harmonize with itself through all its parts; that gaudy and ill assorted colors, awkward forms, and even elegant forms and foldings, in that kind of display which may deserve the epithet meretricious, however warranted by thefashion of the day, should be avoided. With what ideas do that nakedness of the female figure, and that abundant complexity, that mystery of folding, of the drapery about the room to receive such figures, as we have been accustomed to see, harmonize ?

It contained two or more wide drawers, with doors above them opening on shelves and racks, the whole standing on legs high enough to admit of sweeping under the cupboard. Memory recalls one, the framing and ends being of white walnut or hickory and the door panels and drawer fronts of cherry, both native woods, the creamy white of the hickory contrasting finely with the warm wine red of the cherry.

       " 'Mediaeval furniture — Mobilia, as it is rightly styled — is one of the rarest manifestations of art-work or handicraft. Our knowledge of it is principally from pictures, illustrated MSS. and carvings. Contrary to the received opinion of some of the acknowledged authorities on Mediaeval art, we are convinced that there would be no difficulty in producing a very complete history of mobilia, the material for which could be drawn from the sources indicated. We see many modern specimens of both a bad and vitiated class of works, made at a time when splendid decoration reigned in place of art, and indeed no such thing as art existed. From this period we moderns have borrowed almost all our models, it being precisely the most unhappy choice we ',\n",
       " 'could have made, not only on account of the amount of useless, expensive, and vulgar decoration it has led us into, but because the mere system of construction adopted is false, and so far, happily, insuring no lasting durability to the products of such workmanship. The furniture of every country has echoed in its form and decoration the character and spirit of the art then prevailing. In Egypt, of old, the tables, seats, couches, etc., preserved in the British Museum and other collections, testify to this; one or two things copied in bronze or marble from Greek works of this class, express exactly the same kind of thing, and point out by the extreme chastity of their forms, the peculiar idiosyncrasy of that nation, no less than by the skillful manner in which they are put together, the mechanical ability of the workman. Our knowledge of Roman doings in this matter is derived from similar sources. One or two examples of curule chairs that might have belonged to Pro-Consuls of Gaul or elsewhere, do indeed remain, with strange legends attached to them, and saints and monarchs of very questionable verity or appropriateness. Upon Pompeian pictures, bronzes, etc., we must rely, without which we should be more ignorant of these things than of the seemingly much more perishable and fragile manufactures in glass and earthenware, or even iron, of which such innumerable specimens exist. We have as many remains of Assyria as of old Rome. There is no doubt from the gorgeous illuminations of the ',\n",
       " 'period of the lower Empire, that the furniture then in use was, characteristically wrought, of extraordinary splendour, gilded, incrusted, and inlaid with ivory and jewels to a degree that quite marred its artistic beauty. Of this, much purified by Italian taste, some slight ',\n",
       " 'traces are to be found in the Venetian works, affected as they were in this, as in other things, by oriental neighborhood and associations. The Venetians improved these works, be it understood, and chastened, while they truly enriched the tawdry over decoration of the Greeks.. Their conquest in the islands and commercial seats in so many parts of the Byzantine Empire, brought them in contact with more than one point of its character. Of constructional felicity there is almost none in Byzantine examples of which we have knowledge. ',\n",
       " 'In Europe, in the middle ages, the character of mobilia was ever that of current architecture, then the art to which all the other major as well as minor arts were subordinated, — that fact of their subordination being one to be ever most needfully borne in mind by the student of archaeological science and mediaeval art. We find this leading fact constantly forgotten by writers on the arts. To furniture particularly, painting became serviceable, the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries never missing an opportunity of employing that art in this way. Hence, several painters began life as decorators, as many more were sculptors who began as goldsmiths. Marquetry was another most effective means of decoration, becoming estimable from an early period of these epochs by the careful method of its execution, and, later, from the fine forms and colors its patterns displayed. In the sixteenth century much beautiful work was produced, its early decades being, indeed, to be regarded as the culminating period in furniture designing. Colors due to the above means, or rich velvets and silks, brocaded or woven with gold thread, took precedence in characteristic ornamentation at a somewhat late portion of this era. But carving, as so many French and German works testify, was largely employed. Both these characters ran into ruinous riot in the next epoch, and lavish magnificence took the place of beautiful design, the use of things themselves becoming hidden under a desire to waste all the ',\n",
       " 'costliness and folly of extravagant ornamentation upon them. At this time began the still existing mania for furniture made for show ; and to be shut up in a room, wastefully decorated with merely costly ornaments, intended to be seen only, and but sparingly brought into use. It was the \"bright poker\" idea at its maddest. Hence we now find reception rooms that were too fine for use, and frail furniture neither man nor woman dared to intrust their persons upon. More sumptuosity and ridiculous degradation of taste burst out under Louis XIV., when those preposterously tawdry gewgaws that are to be seen here and there in sale rooms, when some old household is broken up, overloaded with tortoise shell, brass, sham jewelry, and vile carvings, and generally made to imitate something that had not the remotest resemblance to the real nature of article in question, but preferably that farthest from it. Thus a cabinet or \"armoire\" faced the world with an extravagant architectural frontage, and a chest of drawers was a miniature frontage. As was to be expected from the political state of the time, the most hideous of these monFigure 58 strosities came, not from ',\n",
       " 'France, where the taste for these originated, but from servile Germany, whose craftsmen vied with each other in the cities of Nuremburg, Augsburg, and Dres',\n",
       " 'den, as to who should make the most monstrous foolery at the most wasteful cost. Italy, as usual, before her utter degradation kept to the fashions of an earlier date or improved by her native gift of taste, upon that current in such a manner that something of her old inheritance is seen even at this time. ',\n",
       " \"Later in the seventeenth century especially, this whimsicality took a new bent, and a queer hothouse sort of life, a meretricious vitality, such as disease often has, broke out, and the Louis XV. fashion got into vogue, when oddly shaped forms, mouldings and inlays were employed, and flat surfaces bore the works of men's lives — not of their minds, but of their patient dull drudgery at outre and elaborate combinations of art — necessarily, therefore, devoid of real taste and common sense. Incrustations of brass, copper, tin, and even silver were engraved by the burin to imitate relief or actual mouldings. Wreaths, termed masks — not the pretty Amorini of an earlier age — were attached to the articles, their office being almost invariably to hide some dishonesty of construction or to give a curve to some weak angle or strengthen some spindling line, to the eye at least, but not in fact. Indeed it is notably a marked characteristic of this class of works that all their tendencies are to be willfully false. One sees at once that the craftsman does not err in ignorance of the demands of his duty because things which might, constructionallv employed, give real strength when needed, although of \",\n",
       " \"a supplementary sort, willfully give only the look of strength, and, as if by malicious intention to lie for lying's sake, neglect their duty when it \\\\yere easier to do it honestly than to fail or neglect. Thus it is in the major art of that time; thus it was in life, among the leaders, at least; thus it was upon everything that lies upon the surface of that rotten era, that nothing but the fiery ruin of revolution could purge pure. \",\n",
       " 'Mere costliness is no element of art or good taste. We have seen very handsome chairs sold at a price that would condemn them in the eyes of untrained wealth, just as we have seen on the tea-table of the poor and lowly, low cost china that would put to blush — if it was possible — much of the high priced porcelain that decorates the cabinets of the wealthy. ',\n",
       " 'The perfecting of many processes of manufacture has placed at the disposal of artists and ornamental designers means for the reproduction and multiplication of their works, of which they have not been slow to avail themselves. As a class they undoubtedly occupy more definitely the position of leaders or teachers ; and we are fairly entitled to hope that by this teaching the standard of public taste has been raised. The soil to be cultivated is rank with weeds, and the intelligent laborers are few. Our manufactures are in advance of our taste. The conditions of art and manufacture in the Middle Ages are in our day reversed : then there was a Raphael to design, but no Minton to reproduce skillfully ',\n",
       " 'and at a cheap rate the pattern example ; now we have the power of cheap reproduction, but not many designs worth reproducing; so we wisely store our museums with all the best examples of human invention, and thus provide ourselves at once with a standard, and with a check upon any vain ideas we may be disposed to entertain of our intellectual superiority and advanced taste. ',\n",
       " \"Never in the world's history were the means of spreading a taste for art among the people as abundant. The productions of our manufacturers are placed before us with cheapness and certainty, and where bad taste in designs is to be noted, the fault can hardly be laid at the door of the producer, who, in many cases failing to secure the services of an original or even capable designer, is driven to pander to a taste which he would willingly enough direct if he could. We have so-called schools of design, instituted expressly to provide our manufacturers with intelligent designers; and we are able, by means of lithographic printing and photo engraving, to distribute cheaply and make common property throughout the length and breadth of the land the finest examples of all good art, in whatever form it may have appeared. Yet, after all, in the comprehension of good design, in appreciation of beautiful form, in sentiment of color, we are but a barbarous people as compared with any Eastern nation, or with our own Gothic ancestors. The best that can be said of us is \",\n",
       " 'that we feel our inferiority when we look at an Indian shawl, at a Moorish pitcher, a Persian rug, or a Chinese vase. We try unsuccessfully to reproduce them ; we do actually reproduce the ceramic ware of the 16th century, and glory in it; while we vainly strive to copy the mediaeval stained-glass windows, and are driven to confess that a people who flourished before the foundation of Rome were capable of designing a gold setting for a brooch which puts all our barbarous efforts to shame. ',\n",
       " 'The spread of art is one thing; the advance is another. With our eyes open, it would be vain to deny that throughout the kingdom a new taste has arisen, and a desire among all classes of the people to appropriate some form of art is evident. But taste implies only accuracy of judgment, not that power of execution which follows in its wake. The taste of the man who knows is not that of the man who does. ',\n",
       " 'The first-named may be considered as a bon vivant, who is fond of the dishes before him, and distinguishes nicely what is savoury and delicious, or flat and insipid in the ingredients of each ; while the second may be regarded as the cook, who, from knowing what things will mix well together, and distinguishing by a nice taste, when he has arrived at that happy result, is able to compose such exquisite mixtures. ',\n",
       " 'In the construction and ornamentation of furniture, as of buildings, grounds, clothing, and of everything\" ',\n",
       " 'else of a material character, external to ourselves, several things are to be considered in their relation to our needs, comfort, and enjoyment. The mere necessaries of life are really very few, though even these may be multiplied by habit, education, and circumstance. The man of thorough culture and high civilization certainly needs many things which the savage can do without and which would be even an incumbrance to him. But if these, increased in number as they are by artificial circumstances, are fully supplied, we are not, and ought not to be, satisfied. We may and should consider what is adapted to promote our comfort and gratify our taste, ministering appropriately, in both directions, to our enjoyment. For our present purpose and in connection with cabinet and upholstery work, it will be sufficient to consider three things — Novelty, Taste and Utility. ',\n",
       " 'i. Novelty. — This is always a source of pleasure, affording a healthful excitement to the mind. This is the reason of the frequently sudden and extreme changes in fashion, of the desire to visit localities and scenes which are new and strange to us, and of the effort to secure for the gratification of all the senses ever new means of pleasure and excitement. The conservative critic may find fault with this universal tendency to innovation, but it will excite and exert its influence so long as the human mind tires of sameness, and seeks for change. We desire repose and permanency of con',\n",
       " 'ditions and surroundings only when we have ceased to acquire and develop, and our powers have begun to decline with the coming on of old age. This quality of novelty is one which all who would cater for the popular taste and, by so doing, secure and maintain a successful business, must aim at in connection with other qualities of excellence. It is also unquestionably true that the desire and effort for novelty leads sometimes to the adoption of styles and ornaments which are unsymmetrical and incongruous, and though striking and sometimes even almost pleasing to those who crave that which is startling and outre, they will greatly offend good taste. There are certain established principles which are the basis of all correct procedure, and any rule of mechanical practice, or even what has come to be an established custom may be departed from or neglected, so that there is no infringement of these fixed principles, among which may be named fitness, utility, propriety. If, in seeking novelty, the artist-mechanic introduces that which is in violation of the principles of unity and harmony, he will forfeit his claim to be called in any sense an artist. Let him rather search for the union of novelty with other beauties, with a constant consideration of a reference to fundamental principles., and to this end it will be well that he should thoroughly study the details of the works of ancient art, whether of the Gothic and other mediaeval styles, or of the more remote classical. From these may be gathered ',\n",
       " 'suggestions which, by exact reproduction or suitable combination, will afford designs, which may be applied to modern uses with excellent effect for internal finishing and furniture. ',\n",
       " '2. We consider, in the next place, the element of Taste in construction and ornamentation. It has been well said that \"art can lend to an object a value, greater than that of the material and workmanship of which it consists, even when the object is formed of precious materials, as of rare marbles, scarce woods, or \\'silver or gold/ \\' And, where the material is of less intrinsic value, yet more will depend on art and the taste displayed in figure and ornament. The beautiful, the tasteful has a commercial value — a remark as true of the goods named in the opening sentence of this article, as of those in any line of manufacture. It follows, then, that the manufacturer, who can in the highest degree secure that the productions of his establishment shall be in the greatest degree tasteful, and worthy to be styled beautiful, will in this fact secure no mean advantage in the busy arena of competition. Expenditure in the employment of designers who shall be true artists, even though it may seem hardly necessary or profitable, may prove to be really wise in principle, and most satisfactory in results. The workman also may, with great benefit to himself, study these works thus greatly enhancing the value of his labor, and become more than a mechanic, for he that can, in a novel form or one that ',\n",
       " 'is original with himself, form a chair or a table, which, either as a whole or in its details, is really tasteful — \"a thing of beauty\" — is truly an artist. If he has the laudable ambition in this manner to rise above his fellows, let him acquaint himself with the laws of beauty, so that he shall be able at once to see the difference, and the reason of it, between the beautiful and the ugly, the graceful and the deformed, the refined and the coarse. Let him study the works of art of all ages, in the great variety of subjects to which art has been applied, and he will not only have opened to him new and most fruitful sources of pleasures, but will add, to mere skill in the use of tools, the development of a talent that shall command its price. ',\n",
       " '3. The other point which we proposed to consider was — Utility. This may appear to be independent in some measure of the considerations before named, yet a manifest adaptation to the purpose for which it is designed will be an element in the decision of the question whether it is tasteful or not. Such is the constitution of the human mind that what might, aside from any consideration of its use, seem to be without form or comeliness, assumes a certain appearance of beauty, when it seems to be precisely fitted to the convenience of the user. It is also clear that the purpose for which an object is intended should be met in its structure and form, and no adjunct, for the sake merely of decoration, should be permitted to interfere with its utility, or be ',\n",
       " 'inconsistent with the position which it occupies in relation to the whole subject or article. The material should be studied with its adaptability to those forms ',\n",
       " 'which are essential to the use of the article which is to be manufactured. It should not be assumed that, because certain forms and decorations may be appropriate to one material, they would be equally adapted to, and look equally well in, another material entirely different in its character. One of the essentials of a good design ',\n",
       " 'in industrial art is the adaptation of the natural characteristics of the materials in which the design is to be realized. The form, also, must in every case subserve the purpose for which the article is to be made, the lines being as graceful and as true in the relative proportions of the parts as will be consistent with the convenience of the person who may use the article. When, however, the objection is made to a chair or to a lounge that one cannot sit or rest easily and comfortably upon it, it is not a sufficient answer that the form of the one is graceful and all its lines those of beauty, and that the other is tasteful in design, and that in material and covering there is harmony both of proportions and of colors. They are articles not to be looked at — not that merely or chiefly — but to be used, and in their very form should be suggestive of rest, refreshment, repose. Other illustrations might be given of this point ; these, however, will suffice to illustrate the position that, whenever utility is sacrificed to novelty or to ornamental appearance, however pretty, the article is badly designed, and the art or skill exercised upon it has been practically thrown away. ',\n",
       " 'Words are more or less indefinite in their meaning, and admit of wider and more comprehensive translation, according to their context with other words, or their association with ideas previously existing in the minds of their hearers. Among them all, there are perhaps none more difficult to explain than the word style, ',\n",
       " 'by Webster, we shall find how large is its range, how wide its divergence from any center that can be marked out for it. Walker puts among other things as its signification \"manner of writing,\" with regard to language; manner of speaking, appropriate to particular character ; title, appellation. All this may be right ; at any rate is enough for him who is not required to go into lengthy definitions, but merely to throw out such suggestions as will, when united with others, be the seed of future comprehension. ',\n",
       " 'I think we may acknowledge style to be the instrument of power by which we convey emphasis of expression in our work, and render intelligible forms which would otherwise be both meaningless and purposeless. There is another word which artists are in the habit of associating, and even confusing with style, Manner, which when repeated again and again is designated as mannerism, a feature by which we are too often enabled to distinguish the productions of one man, and even of one age, from those of another; but there is a wide difference between it and style. Style advances whatever it is attached to, makes its intentions more evident, increases the force of its expression, as well as frees it from impurities which in no way help the object it has in view ; while manner, or mannerism, on the contrary, serves no good purpose, is, in fact, most frequently merely the mirror in which the artist, or may be the period at which he lived, is unconsciously reflected. ',\n",
       " 'That style and manner are frequently so mingled one with another as to render it difficult to separate them, or to distinguish which is which, I will confess; but the simple text I have here put to you will, I think, if carefully attended to, though perhaps not serving as an exact definition, show what is style and what is not, and even tell in what proportion mannerism, if any, is introduced. ',\n",
       " 'This question the student will do well to constantly consider, as it tends to elevate what he may send forth, and keep it free from much that is detrimental to excellence, though at the same time highly seductive to the young mind. I wish to be the more impressive in this advice, because I cannot help fancying that at this moment there is a more than usual quantity of mannerism passing for style in the world of Art, and that students are mistaking one for the other, and running after the wrong thing, by affecting peculiarities and imitating weaknesses belonging to past ages, and quite out of place in the present day. I am not saying this in any invidious spirit; on the contrary, I am ready to acknowledge that many fine works are put forth among us, that carry out with powerful emphasis the spirit that is within them, simply because the treatment of every part is in unison with that spirit, and serves to elucidate the meaning intended by the sculptor ; but the weed of mannerism is growing at the same time among us — mannerism, I fancy, not derived even from the best ',\n",
       " 'Style is the gold that is the mark of genius, and mannerism the color by which you distinguish from whence it comes. All that relates to style is derived from the most profound knowledge. ',\n",
       " 'With some style implies simple excellence of treatment in contradiction to the absence of that quality, and they read it as a mannerism always the same, and equally applicable to the carrying out in Art of all subjects — they talk of a Classical style and think this is the only adjunct that can properly be attached to it. There are other meanings to the word than this, or rather its meaning is capable of great extension. There is the Severe style, perhaps pretty much, though not quite the same thing as the Classical; then there is the Gothic style, which, clinging to a certain extent to the Classical, has its own peculiar mode of expression. Then, again, the simple and the Florid styles, which, it is not too much to say, are directly opposed to each other; and the Domestic style, which contradicts and entirely sets at defiance the Classical ; and we might even add to them the Grotesque style, which hardly claims relationship with any of them. We will endeavour to explain the difference between them and the requirements of each. ',\n",
       " 'The classical style would be the line we should adopt in our work when the subject to be treated belongs to ',\n",
       " 'the classical days of old — when it associates itself with the grand old bards whose distant footsteps echo through the corridors of time, or whose conceptions are of that lofty nature that they admit of no minute detail, or dwelling on petty things. Our illustrations of them should then be in the same style, severe and simple, not ',\n",
       " 'like everyday Nature, but like a something which we all of us, more or less, endeavour to conceive, and even long to be about us; but which can only exist ideally within ourselves, more or less clear, according as we are capable of entering into the feeling of the poet, or of becoming part of it ourselves. ',\n",
       " 'The error modern imitators of Greek Art generally commit is exaggerating the tendency to straight lines and the repetition of them. ',\n",
       " 'The Gothic style, as we have said before, retains some connection with the Classic by preserving its quiet ',\n",
       " 'simplicity as well as its grace of line. That it has much of mannerism cannot be denied, arising, often from the mistake of the workers in it, who have fancied that rudeness and exaggeration of form necessarily belonged to it. This peculiarity, however, appertains only to the more decayed periods, and not to the time when it rose into beauty and fine art, as in the 13th century. That it had then and has now a style of its own is certain, for it had to express and does express the tone and feeling of a religion quite distinct from that of the Greeks — less earthly or sensuous, more pure and ethereal, more divine. We are now speaking, of course, of monumental and religious Art, the only things in which the Gothic is appropriate. In a domestic or homely sphere it always appears to be out of place and unsuited to the purpose. ',\n",
       " 'The Gothics were greater architects than the Greeks, in a way, but it would be idle to assert that they were as good sculptors; there is no reason, however, why the finest works should not be combined with the Gothic style, for they can be made quite compatible with it. ',\n",
       " 'Even the Florid style, which, from our dislike to it as somewhat debasing Art, we feel much inclined to stigmatize with the title of mannerism, is sometimes admissible ; in fact, must be acknowledge to be, under some circumstances, the most appropriate — for instance in the decoration of the theatre, the ball-room, and other places of amusement. Surely when so placed it is ',\n",
       " 'more in unison than any other with that elevation of the spirits which is supposed to pervade the scene. ',\n",
       " 'The severe, unaffected Classical style would be a damper on our enjoyment under such circumstances, when we are not looking coldly on at real life, but taking, so to speak, a glance at it through a colored glass or our imagination. ',\n",
       " 'Shakespeare, in his poetic drama of \"The Tempest,\" seems to give us a view of it in this florid style. He elevates by his poetical imagination the scenes he portrays, and so leads us away into a realm of ideality more florid, more enjoyable than the reality we are compelled every day to take part in. You must do the same with your art, or at any rate furnish your portion in that enjoyment, and you will do it best by bending it to the same feeling. ',\n",
       " 'It is under such influences that high and ornamental sculpture most frequently join hands together, and are present, not as real personages, or as representatives of particular ideas, but as decorations of a scene created for the transient pleasure of the moment. Your lines may now flow with greater freedom, your figures perform their parts with less reserve than on other occasions, your style may in short be florid. It is here, if anywhere, that color may be introduced into your statues, as well as into the ornaments about them. The danger is of their becoming sensuous; but the refinement, whether of design or execution, which you will ',\n",
       " 'introduce, will keep that down in the same way as the great dramatist has done in the fairy tale I have just alluded to. There are scenes and characters in that which connect it with the lower features of humanity, and so preserve a relationship to the real, which no imaginative work, whether of Art or Literature, should be entirely without ; whilst there are others, the creation of poetic fancy, which serve to lift us upwards into the realms of ideality; and make us the better for the enjoyment we receive. You will say we are soaring into the region of rhodomontade and losing the practical; but we may tell you that you need not feel yourself so strictly bound by rule in this style as in the others ; your forms are not required to be so true to the modesty of Nature as they are generally ; they may be made more elective by a departure from truth, or at any rate an exaggeration of fact. With those proportions which Nature has given to different objects of her creation you may deal freely, altering them to suit your own ; _ k rposes of expression or effect. We will put before you Cellini, as the highest example in this walk of Art. Strictly speaking he is an ornamentalist ; but he sometimes attempts high Art, where there is often with him a lack of correct proportion — for instance, in his statue of Perseus, where the over ornamentation hardly hides from a practical eye the want of proper balance of parts. Sometimes, indeed, in his metal works he uses his freedom as a license which serves the stvle to which his ',\n",
       " 'work belongs, and so answers the purpose he has in view ; he is rarely, if ever, quite natural, though always florid in his style, and always effective. ',\n",
       " 'It will be impossible in a work of this kind, to write at length on the various styles, so we will content ourselves with touching on some of those styles which seem to have been much in favor at certain periods. To go into this matter extensively would require several volumes of greater dimensions than the present one. ',\n",

       " 'Men who do not sit have two attitudes for resting; women use one of their own. Squatting on the heel is favored in India and China.

First the rulers began with thrones and seats of honor for the kings and nobles; then the rich merchants followed, providing themselves with furniture less costly, perhaps, but equally as useful as that owned and used by State officials. The working classes and the poor were doubtless content to sit down on their mats of papyri stalks, under the shelter of their rough cabins of mud. The rich of the dynasties, dating from the twelfth to the thirtieth, furnished their houses with very costly furniture, which consisted principally of rich beds, or couches with their beds, or mattresses, pillows and cushions, and wooden head-rests, footstool stands, tables and chairs, both with high and low back; or folding stools, like the Greek okladias, boxes or chests for holding clothes and other objects. From the earliest period high-backed and other chairs were in use, and at the time of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties were imported as tribute from Ethiopia. Pillows of stone, wood and other objects were also of great antiquity, and are represented in coffins of the sixth and following dynasties. They exhibit a great variety of shape, consisting of a curved semi-elliptical portion, adapted to hold the back of the head, supported by a column or other contrivance resting on a base or pedestal. For furniture, various woods were employed — ebony, acacia or soft cedar, sycamore and others of species not determined; ivory, both of ',\n",

In the paintings in the tombs gorgeous pieces of gilded furniture are depicted. For cushions and mattresses, linen cloth, feathers of water fowl and colored stuffs appear, to have been used, while seats have plaited bottoms of linen cord or tanned and dyed leather thrown over them. Sometimes the skins of panthers were used for the purpose. On the whole an Egyptian house was lightly furnished and not encumbered with so many articles as are in use at the present day. For carpets they used mats of plain fiber, on which children and servants sat, or rather squatted. ',\n",

They are finished in blue and gold and are very dainty pieces of furniture. These illustrations are drawn from photos of the originals now in the Cluny museum. A most beautiful piece of work is a little ebony cabinet, Fig. J2> — now m tne Kensington museum, which was made by the celebrated French cabinet-maker, Boulle. It is beautifully inlaid in the most exquisite designs and made nearly two hundred years ago. ',\n",
       " 'Boulle, not to mention many others of the earlier period, was an artist ; he conceived his own designs, he drew them out (the patent is given him in his name not only as a cabinet-maker, but as an architect and sculptor), he executed everything with his own hands; he was a chaser, engraver, and gilder ; he was, as we see, a man of cultivated tastes into the bargain.\" When we add to his merit as a designer, and a delicate appreciator of the work of others, his merit as a good workman whose productions, without need of repair, are as stout in the present day, after two hundred years of use as they were the day they were made, it may be fairly conceded, even by the sternest rigorist, that Andre Boulle worked in what is understood as\\' the true spirit. Not ',\n",
       " 'only in its construction, but in every feature, in the choice of the materials, in the chasing and gilding and the marquetry, his work will be found to be of the most honest kind, very different to the modern rubbish that passes under the name, where false tortoise shell, made of horn or gelatine ; false mother-of-pearl, box or horn instead of ivory ; brass or even zinc lacquered ornament tacked on to the ill-made joinery usurp the place of true work, whose only fault was that it was produced in a period when the traditions of art were on the decline. When Boulle used wood it was ebony, which the cabinet makers, his successors, on the plea of its difficulty in working, in taking the glue or varnish — Boulle never used varnish — and other reasons, replaced with stained pear-wood. In the choice of his woods Boulle showed the extremest care, and one of his severest blows was his loss, by the fire that destroyed his collection of prints, of a qauntity of rare woods which he had, we learn from the inventory he made at the time, long stored by to season. The bronze he used was honestly chiselled and chased and gilt, not lacquered, and each ornament was a design not stamped out. ',\n",
       " \"The secrets of Boulle's skill may be said to have died with their inventor, for though the traditions were continued, the sobriety and the grandiose style of the master will be found to be sadly wanting in all the work of his imitators.

This bed became quite popular for a time, but ran out of vogue during the revolution after which the Empire Style was introduced, when beds were specially designed for warriors, judges, statesmen and successful leaders; many of the beds were heaps of silly ornament and cumberous and rich draperies. This phase of the Empire style did not last long, however, but gave place to a more sensible practice of construction and ornamentation. The two Plates, V and VI, show details and ornamentation in the better days of the Empire style. Plate V showing some of the best examples of the period. ',\n",

Its promoters had gone to draw inspiration from the philosophical world of antiquity, and they studiously attempted to revive antique rules, traditions and customs, many of which were inconsistent with modern life. The broad-backed chair (Fig. 76) makes a fine looking, comfortable seat. Cleverly hollowed out to catch the back and support the shoulders, it proffers the acme of comfort, without, at the same time, being stuffy. ',\n",
       " 'Passing to Fig. yy, we find a form of couch which was at one time very popular in this country. It reminds one of the old \"high-low\" designs which used to be the fashion in the \"early fifties,\" and there is no doubt that this choice of a resting pad proves a comfort to the sitter who is dainty in the matter of position. ',\n",
       " 'This design, which is without a back, is evidently for use rather than display. Before passing from this design we cannot help noticing the increased opportunities which it gives to the chair or settee frame maker, as he has been too much in the habit of hiding his work with ostentatious upholstery. The small table (Fig. 78) is for decorative rather than useful purposes. The design, if well executed, adds unusual classic dignity to the center of a room, or as a choice corner-piece. This belongs to the class erstwhile known as the \"loo\" table, and has been in the background of late years. It is ',\n",

       " 'The two old German chairs shown at Figs. 80 and 81, are comfortable even if they are heavily built and ponderous looking. They are substantial and strong. The little table, Fig. 82, is characteristic of old time German work. The bed shown in Fig. 83 is drawn from a photo taken of the bed used by Napoleon, and his consort, the unfortunate Josephine. It is said to be a very comfortable bed to rest in and there are many like it still used in France. ',\n",
       " 'The sturdy old chair shown in Fig. 84, is from Spain. In form, the chair is of course, common enough; but a new idea may be gathered from the upholstery. It consists of stout velvet, stuffed properly with feathers, and quilted after down-quilt fashion. It is fastened to the walnut framing with \"extra size\" brass studs, and some neglige trellis fringe is added to finish. It seems to me that such quilted upholstery might be applied to many modern chairs where shallow stuffing is desirable. If hair is substituted for feathers, a comfortable and pleasing result could be obtained without the stuffiness and fragility of bottoming. Altogether this old chair looks commanding as the center-piece in the large glass case in which it is preserved. ',\n",
       " 'We may now safetly turn to English, and American furniture, and its makers, of the eighteenth, and the latter part of the seventeenth centuries, which were the periods of the most artistic work.

French eighteenth-century furniture, though in reality very substantially built, is apt to have a fragile appearance, and every one knows that the grace and freedom of its curves are only to be had at the cost of a considerable loss of strength. In keeping to simpler and more rigid forms the English and American makers were preserving good traditions, and if their ornamental systems were seldom appropriate or in pure taste, at least good workmanship and careful finish cannot be denied them.

       " 'better, there is a mixture of ornamental motives which strikes the eye as incongruous. The pretty rococo crestings, to which, if cast in brass or gilt, no one need object as a finish for the top of the piece, are still not in keeping with the severe geometrical tracery of the panels and sash lines. The two end cupboards especially are out of all harmony with the center form of the pediments. ',\n",

Plate VIII, illustrates some of his best work, especially the chair backs shown at 11 and 12. The other backs shown 1, 3 and 9 are not so chaste but are favorites with some people. The designs shown on Plate IX, are very clever, and in some instances, beautiful but are not by any means up to the best standard of Chippendale's work. \",\n",
       " 'Perhaps on the whole, Sheraton, was as popular as any of the great English masters, and in our opinion, ',\n",
       " 'justly so, for his work was, in many instances, as chaste in design, as finely finished and much more substantial in construction than the work turned out by Chippendale or Heppelwhite. Sheraton succeeded Chippendale ',\n",
       " 'in fashionable esteem, and was a more sober and elegant designer. His pieces never offend the eye, but, on the other hand, they are not so characteristic as those of his less artistic predecessor. The double chair, Fig. 91, covered with a piece of Aubusson tapestry, is in his style, though it may not be of his make. He was very ingenious in inventions of the sort, and numerous contrivances for getting double service out of chairs and tables, are ascribed to him. The sofa, Fig. 92, is an excellent example of the same taste, for the alliance of straight lines with refined curves, on which his fame chiefly rests; indeed, reticence in ornament was his study.

Examples of the work of these two men are scarcely ever found in the market, but when such is the case, the demand for fhem is so great that ridiculously high prices are paid for their possession.

       " \"In a simple treatise it is quite impossible to conveyany adequate idea of the art of cabinet-making. So much could be said that it is most difficult to know what to leave out, and however fully this subject may be enlarged upon, the broad fact that but one-half has been told must remain. Further, a budding cabinetmaker will learn more during the first twelve months of his apprenticeship than all the text-books in the country can teach him. The old Roman motto, Ezperientia docet, is truer to-day than ever. Experience has been, and will be, the best teacher ; but just as it is possible to start in life with better prospects upon the solid foundations laid by one's forebears, so by the aid of a few practical suggestions may a youth be helped upward on the ladder of perfection. The cabinet-maker must always strive after excellence. There is absolutely no room for men who are only halfmasters of their craft ; the net result of incompetence is a general leveling of the highest to the least efficient, a diminution of the rate of wages, and a disastrous lowering of the quality of work. The various styles of workmanship should incite the cabinet trade of today to patient and thoughtful work. It may be urged — and possibly truly — that these master-pieces of which we speak were not the daily product of the age which produced them. That inferior work was then produced \",\n",
       " 'may be admitted; but the mere fact that time has wrought its destruction should be sufficient evidence that this class of work is not such as the twentiethcentury cabinet-maker should imitate. ',\n",
       " 'And here one word to the journeyman of to-day. The apprentice working under your superintendence will be exactly as you make him. Men are copyists ever, and youth is the most impressionable period. See to it, then, that your work be such as the novice treading in your footsteps may safely follow. And let the apprentice benefit by his master\\'s experience, commencing where the latter leaves off, and thus raising the handicraft to a higher level of excellence. The only true way to success is that the heart be in the work; toiling not merely for the \"standard wage,\" nor creating a piece of work only to \"sell/\\' but to last. ',\n",
       " 'Just as to-morrow is the child of to-day, so is the journey-man the fulfilment of the apprenticeship. The groundwork of early days is the foundation upon which the after-work stands, and if the first be faulty then is there but inefficiency hereafter. One word as to the influence of trades-unionism upon the cabinet trade — it has its strong and weak points. On the one hand it demands, and rightly, from the master a standard rate of wage, which is beneficial insomuch ;that it puts all union shops on the same level, and prevents that \"cutting\" policy which is alike disastrous to good work and sound finance. On the other hand it gives no guarantee ',\n",
       " 'of efficiency in the worker ; good and bad are linked in one union, with the result that the least efficient are often out of work and maintained at the expense of their more skilled brothers. The remedy for this seems to lie here : let no man be made a member until he has passed through a satisfactory apprenticeship, and proved himself to be thoroughly acquainted with his trade, and capable of honestly earning the wage demanded; then would the term \"union man\" be understood to mean skill and efficiency, and be as proud a possession of the man earning it as a degree to a college graduate. ',\n",
       " 'Possibly it may be thought that the proceeding lines have savoured too much of the ethics of labor — of work in its highest and ideal form — rather than of the practical teaching of a competing age. But there is a danger that in the mad rush for cheap and badly manufactured furniture the true constructive art may be lost, and a race of men produced wedded to one job, year in and year out, and turning out work bearing neither the stamp of individuality nor the spirit of good workmanship. ',\n",
       " 'Where a draughtsman is not employed, the usual method of setting out work is to make a full-size detail from the scale-drawing supplied.. This is done most conveniently upon 36-inch lining-paper strained upon a board, say 7 ft. x 4 ft. This size will be found to be large enough for most jobs, which need only be drawn ',\n",
       " 'in the majority of cases to the center line, thus showing half the width of the job, the other half being a repeat. The thickness-sections, for the sake of clearness, may be put in with blue or red pencil. Having accomplished this, the next proceeding will be to take off the drawing the various sizes of the several pieces of wood, allowing sufficient margin for finishing to the net sizes, and for the length of tenons, &c. Many of the small pieces can be obtained from the \"scrap\"-room, where all sorts of ends, strips, &c, are stored in their respective classes, thus saving the cutting of a large board for the purpose of an odd rail or so, which might render it useless by reason of a corner having been cut away. ',\n",
       " 'Tools. — The trade of to-day is so much the product of machine labor, that in a fully-equipped shop, where furniture is made to \"stock\" designs, the manual work is little more than that of fitting together the various parts. It is, however, still necessary that the craftsman should be fully acquainted with the use of the tools usually associated with the cabinet-maker\\'s bench. The following list includes all those commonly required, but special tools may be necessary in certain cases : ',\n",
       " 'CABINET MAKERS\\' JOINTS, &c. What may be termed \"edge-joints\" are a necessity in cabinet-making, because timber is not always obtainable wide enough for the counter-top or panel desired; and if it were so, the cost would prohibit its general use; but more because a jointed top or panel will stand much better than a single piece, and this is the chief thing to be aimed at. There is a tendency in some quarters to avoid jointing, but the policy is an unsound one. Again, in the case of oak panelling, a much better effect can be obtained by a jointed panel — throwing all the figures to the center line — than by a single unjointed board. The chief objection to jointing seems to lie in the idea that sooner or later the joint will give; it may, just as anything is likely to happen in badly-constructed work, but given thoroughly dry and seasoned timber, a sound method of jointing, and a good workman to do it, nothing need be feared. The ',\n",
       " 'necessity for jointing will, of course, be governed by the width of the timber employed. It may, however, be taken as a general rule that nothing wider than 13 or 14 inches should be used in a single piece, except in the case of countertops, which often run 3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet wide, and should only have one joint. ',\n",
       " 'There are several methods of jointing which we will now consider in detail: (1) Glue joint; (2) Giue-anddowel; (3) Tongue-and-groove (or rebate); and (4) Double groove and loose tongue. ',\n",
       " 'The Glue Joint shown in Fig. 123 is perhaps the commonest of cabinet joints for such work as bears no weight, — that is, perpendicular work, as carcase ends. The method of making the joints is briefly thus : The two boards are shot with a trying or jointing plane until the surface edges are absolutely true; one piece is placed in the bench-cramp, the other being held so that ',\n",
       " 'the two edges are together; run thin glue along the joint, then work the loose board backwards .and forwards along its fellow until the superfluous glue is extracted; the joint should now be allowed to set. If the work has been well done the wood is much more likely ',\n",
       " 'to break at some other point than the joint. Complete success depends upon two factors — true jointing with the plane, and good glue. There are so many good makes of the latter that there should be no difficulty whatever in obtaining it. Remember that the best glue is always the cheapest, for two reasons — its adhesive qualities and capacity for absorption of water. Good glue should take up its own weight of water, i. e., i lb. of glue in the oake should produce 2 lbs. weight in liquid ',\n",
       " 'form. The joint to be glued should be thoroughly warmed, as this makes the glue much more adhesive than if applied to a cold surface. ',\n",
       " 'addition of a series of dowels placed along the joint, the object being to ensure greater strength for such purposes as a countertop. The dowels may be ft inch or y 2 inch in diameter, according to the thickness of the timber to be jointed. They should be placed (say) 12 inches apart and bored in 1 inch deep, the end of the dowel glued and knocked in with a framing hammer, then sawn off to the depth of the corresponding hole, and the ends of the dowels rounded over; glue both edges of the joint, the dowels, and dowel-holes, knock down, and cramp up. The superfluous glue will thus be ',\n",
       " 'The Tongue-and-Groove Joint, Fig. 125, possesses advantages not found in the preceding ones, viz. a greater strength, and should the joint \"give,\" the presence of the tongue prevents light from showing through. With ',\n",
       " 'a pair of match-planes make a groove on one piece onethird the width of the timber used, by half an inch deep, and make a corresponding tongue on the other piece. When this has been done, fit the two together, seeing that the tongue will move freely along the groove, then glue and rub together as in Fig. 123, and cramp up. ',\n",
       " 'In the Double Groove and Loose Tongue (Fig. 126) — the main idea seems to be that when jointing two soft-woods together a hard-wood tongue (which should be cut across the grain) may be inserted, rendering the ',\n",
       " 'joint less liable to snap than if a tongue were cut on the soft-wood itself and lengthways with the grain. Proceed as in Fig. 125, only making two grooves, each the same width and depth; glue the joints and loose tongue ; rub, and cramp up. ',\n",
       " 'We have previously spoken of straight jointing for panels, carcass ends, &c, but the methods described are not suitable for the joints of pieces meeting at an angle, as in the framing of a door or of panelling. Joints of this kind may be considered under four heads: (1) Dovetailing ; ( 2 ) Mortise-and-tenon ; ( 3 ) Dowel ; and (4) Mitre. Two broad principles would seem to govern these, viz. that the wood employed be absolutely dry, and that the joint be true. Any deviation from either of these fixed rules must result in failure; and the second is to a large extent dependent on the first, for however good the workmanship may be, if the wood be unseasoned shrinkage must inevitably occur, with the result that it is almost impossible to put the work right when once the job has been framed up. Hence the necessity of insisting that absolutely dry stuff is an essential in the cabinet trade. ',\n",
       " '1. Dovetailing*— Fig. 127, is undoubtedly the joint par excellence for cabinet work ; it takes three forrns. No. 1 represents the ordinary open dovetail. Each piece to be^ clp-vetailed is marked with a gauge and regulator, spacing the dovetails according to the width of wood to be jointed. This form is used wherever the ',\n",
       " 'construction is hidden from view, its defect being that the ends of the dovetail are cut completely through, thus showing, if exposed, the end grain of the \"keys\" of the other piece. When this is not desired the dovetail is made as No. 2. All dovetails should be cut wedge-shaped, so that when glued and hammered they will tighten up, and when smoothed down present a perfect joint. ',\n",
       " 'The overlapping or concealed dovetail (No. 2) is used in drawer fronts, where it is desirable to conceal the mode of construction. The dovetail is cut entirely through the side, but only two-thirds through the front ; the joint, therefore, is visible on the end only and not on the front. This is an absolute necessity in the case of veneering, for which purpose an absolutely flat surface must be obtained, otherwise the \"keys\" would show through the thin veneer and spoil the whole effect. The jointing up and finishing is precisely the same as in No. 1. ',\n",
       " 'The mitre-dovetailed (No. 3) is adopted for fine work where it is undesirable to show the dovetail either on front or side, and consists of a dovetail having a mitre on each outside edge; the finished joint appears as a single mitre without disclosing the dovetail within. ',\n",
       " 'The Mortise-and-Tenon is the most satisfactory joint for two pieces in the same plane meeting at an angle ; it takes a variety of forms (Fig. 128). The main point to be borne in mind is that the parts to form the ',\n",
       " 'joint be cut true; otherwise, either the tenon will be slack and the joint useless, or too tight and will split open the mortise. ',\n",
       " 'tenon will be slightly wedged. Other methods of fixing the joints are : ( i ) to make the mortise large enough to admit of a wedge being driven in on each side the tenon, which effectually \"keys\" it; in this case the tenon is usually put in dry, that is without glue; and (2) to split open the tenon with a chisel, and insert a wedge in the center and drive home. The danger of ',\n",
       " 'this method is that the tenon is liable to be necked off at the shoulder, while in the former case the rail may be split. If the mortise and tenon are fitted true, no wedging should be necessary. ',\n",
       " 'The thickness of the tenon should be one-third that of the rail and the width not more than 4 inches. If a wider rail has to be used, it would be better to make two mortises and tenons, as shown in Nos. 4 and 5. ',\n",
       " 'can be made as shown, or of the full width between the grooves, which are made on either side for the purpose of receiving the panels. ',\n",
       " 'mortises. These should be cut slightly deeper than the tenon, the joint being glued up and cramped. ',\n",
       " 'Nos. 4 and 5. — Methods of framing wide rails by means of double-tenons, suitable for doors where wide rails are necessary. No. 4 is usually called a gunstock joint. ',\n",
       " 'In framing angles having moulds on one or both edges, the moulds may be intersected either by mitring or scribing. In the mitred joint, the moulds are cut down at an angle of 45 degrees to the mortise-hole, and the moulds adjoining the tenon are cut to fit. The only danger in this method is that, if the wood is wet the mitre will dry in, leaving an open space impossible to deal with. ',\n",
       " 'The process of scribing (Fig. 130) is to cut under one of the rails to the pattern of the other which it is ',\n",
       " 'intended to join ; but this cannot so easily be done with mouldings containing many members, as it would be too costly. It, however, has the advantage that, if shrinkage occurs, the joint can be knocked up again, which would be impossible in the former case. ',\n",
       " 'although not invariably. Fig. 131 shows a scribed joint for panel-mouldings. The vertical moulding C is cut away at A to fit on to the horizontal moulding D. The thick line AB shows the line the scribe will make at the point of intersection. ',\n",
       " '3. Dowel-Joint (Fig. 132) though often adopted, as it economizes labor, is not as satisfactory as the mortiseand-tenon. The dowels, which are usually }i inch in diameter, often shrink, causing the joint to \"give.\" If the dowels are of beech and the timber dry, the joint should be satisfactory. The usual method of setting out a doweljoint is to cut a piece of paper the size of the rail and prick through the centers required according to ',\n",
       " 'the number of dowels desired. These are afterwards marked upon the timber itself. If the wood is not more than i inch thick, the dowels should be set out in the center of the rail in a straight line ; if thicker wood is used, put the dowels in zigzag fashion, which is the better way where it can be managed. ',\n",
       " 'Where small sizes are used, the joint at the angle formed by two pieces not in the same plane is usually mitred. The construction of the joint is thus hidden. No. i, Fig. 133, shows an ordinary mitre at an angle of 45 degrees, such as is used in the framing of a plinth or cornice frieze; the joint is strengthened by a block inside. No. 2 represents the same method, with the additional safeguard of keys ; this would be adopted in the case of thin wood where the mitre surface is very ',\n",
       " 'small, and where there is consequently a liability to break ; the keys are usually put in with veneer, a saw-cut being all that is necessary for their insertion. Glue is run in and the joint levelled off. No. 3 is a variation of No. i. ',\n",
       " 'Fig. 134, shows an angle framed by dowels, having on the one edge a bead, which breaks the joint; this would be used in framing a pilaster upon the end of a carcass. ',\n",
       " 'No. 1, Fig. 136, shows the method of framing a through rail intersected into a center leg, not more than three inches square. No. 2 shows the construction if the center leg is above that size, and is not mortised or dowelled. No. 3 is copied from an old card-table ; the shouldering and dovetailing of the rail show advantages over No. 1, ',\n",
       " 'A cornice may be worked out of the solid piece or built up in various pieces. The latter form is usually adopted by cabinet-makers, except for small cornices. No. i, Fig. 137, shows a built-up mould; the pieces ',\n",
       " 'should be glued and screwed together, blocks being put at the back to give additional strength. No. 2 shows a solid hardwood moulding faced upon softwood, the mould having a rebate for the insertion of a dentil (shown by dotted lines), egg-and-dart, or other ornament. ',\n",
       " 'Ofttimes the cabinet-maker is left to design the mouldings, in which case it is absolutely necessary that he be thoroughly conversant with the mouldings of the particular style or period in which he is working, as a Gothic mould would be out of place upon a Renaissance piece of work, and a Jacobean cornice upon a Sheraton ',\n",
       " 'job. If the designer is not conversant with the grammar of ornament, all kinds of incongruous mixtures are ',\n",
       " 'created, neither true to style nor beautiful. The same remarks apply also to carving and turnery, and as there ',\n",
       " 'are so many text-books of style published, there is absolutely no excuse for ignorance in this matter. ',\n",
       " 'Another point upon which a word may be said is the proportioning of mouldings one to the other in the building-up of a cornice. Let it be supposed that one has to be stuck by hand. It is frequently possible to pick out a series of stock members all the same size, Figure 139 ',\n",
       " 'and to strike out a variety of cornices by ringing the changes on them. The result, however, will be a moulding as shown in No. 1, Fig. 138, where all the members, a,b,c,d,e,f, are of equal depth. This is both incorrect and inelegant ; no moulding made up of a series of members should have any two in conjunction of the same depth, but the proportion should be varied after the manner shown in No. 2, the effect of which — it will be at once apparent — is much better than No. 1. ',\n",
       " 'In cabinet-work the methods of hanging a door, table-leaf, &c, to its corresponding part, are simple, and the foundation of the joint varies but little, though in the case of hanging a door with heavy projecting moulding and cornice upon the face, special long-shouldered butts would be used. The main point in all hangings by ',\n",
       " 'means of hinges is to see that each hinge bears its due proportion of weight, thus avoiding strain and consequent friction and possibly breakage. ',\n",
       " 'Hinges may be of cast or malleable iron, steel, brass, copper, gun-metal, or a combination of metals, such as brass with steel washers ; for heavy work these washers should always be used, the wearing parts being stronger. ',\n",
       " 'The earliest form of hinge seems to have been in the form of an oak pin (A Fig. 139) shaped from the rail itself, and working in a socket cut into the cross rail above, the doors being framed up with the job itself; the form is common in fifteenth and sixteenth century woodwork. Later, the influence of Flemish work. is ',\n",
       " 'apparent, and the pinjoint gives place to wrought-iron hinges placed upon the face of the door and frame with artistic effect, and attached by means of large-headed hails (Fig. 140). During the Queen Anne and Chippendale periods, the hinges were delicately made of cast brass and fixed by screws. ',\n",
       " 'The ordinary way of hanging by butts is shown in No. 1, Fig. 141, the rebate is not carried through the wood, and the knuckle projects on the front side. If this is not desired, the hinges must be fixed flush, and a bead of the. same thickness as the knuckle run down ',\n",
       " 'to make a better finish. When a lid is to be hinged, it would be done as in No. 2, the overhang at the back being, in the case of a small lid, sufficient to serve as a stop when the lid is open. ',\n",
       " 'In hanging a table-leaf, many forms may be adopted. No. 1, Fig. 142, shows a beaded and rebated joint, the center of the hinge being directly under the joint. Exccpt for dust-proof or light-tight purposes, the rebate is not necessary. This joint would open to 90 degrees. Should the leaf or door require to fold back behind the other part, the hinp-e should be placed as shown in No. 2, the dotted lines showing the position of the leaf when ',\n",
       " 'folded back. Another form of leaf hanging is that known as a \"rule joint,\" which is shown closed in No. 3, and open in No. 4. This has the advantage of concealing the hinge, and making a better finish when open ',\n",
       " 'than otherwise would be the case ; the joint is somewhat difficult to get true, but always repays the labor in effect. A variation of this joint is shown in No. 5. ',\n",
       " '.Carcass doors are generally hung as shown in No. 1, Fig. 143, a bead the size of the knuckle being run down to break the joint, and the hinge rebated into the ',\n",
       " 'door its entire thickness. No. 2 shows the method of hanging on to the ends of a carcass* where the full clearance of the door is desired, such as would be the case in a cupboard fitted with sliding trays. No. 3 shows the same method, but with air-tight bead for a cabinet or show-case. ',\n",
       " 'Center hanging, as for wardrobe doors, is shown in Nos. 4 and 5, the door being set back in a rebate, or having a pilaster planted on to hide the joint. Sometimes this joint is made on the rule principle, but this adds to the expense. ',\n",

To save expense, it might, moreover, be made without the underframing or listing shown, although the strength would be reduced without it. But our purpose for the moment is, \"how to make,\" and a few practical hints may be useful on that point. The first business is to produce the moulds to working drawing shown, and as an inch scale is adopted, this should be a simple matter. Then get out the four legs — i. e., two long and two short. The two long legs must be out of 2 in. wood, to allow of throw over scroll at top; iy 2 in. wood will do nicely for the short ones. The seat rails must be 2 in. solid wood, and beech cannot be used except for blocking, as all the wood is more or less seen. The back might be i)A in. wood, to allow, when the top is glued on, for shaping back and front to bring it in a line with the top. The top would take a piece of 4^2 in. wood, to allow for sweep. Of course where several chairs are made, the tops can be marked one into the other, and thus waste of timber avoided ; 1 J4 m wood will be stout enough for the arms and brackets. The splat ',\n",
       " 'Drawer Making and Fitting. It is often said that a man who can make and fit a drawer well can make almost anything in constructive ',\n",
       " 'woodwork. This is probably true, with some reservations, for it is generally accepted as a good test of a man\\'s skill, and we have no doubt that beginners find it one of the most difficult things to tackle, especially in the preparation and \"setting out.\" The general method is as follows, applied to an average sized drawer: — Carefully select the stuff — i. e., y 2 in., finishing Y% in., for sides and back ; Y% in. or %. in. for the bottom, and I in., to finish % in. or J4 in., for the front. All the stuff should be dry and clean, as well as straight and even in the grain, and each piece must be planned up true and gauged to an equal thickness. Care must be ',\n",
       " 'A handy and general workshop method is shown in Figs. 172 and 173, marked on the front of the drawer, ',\n",
       " 'and the back of the back, and (2) on the front end of the sides. These marks indicate the outside and bottom edge of each piece, as well in the giving the number; and if this simple rule is applied there should be no mistake made. Where a set of drawers are the same depth, the same number should be written on the bearer or carcase. In all cases an allowance must be made on the width and length of the front and sides for fitting, and l /$ in. is ample for this ; but the sides can be squared on the shooting board at each end to the length required. It is never a good plan to let a drawer stop on to the back of a job, so the sides should be at least j4 in. or J4 in. less in length than the inside of the carcase. ',\n",
       " 'After preparing the stuff, the next job is to fit it. Carefully joint one end of the front, and fit it to the corresponding end of the opening ; then mark off length ',\n",
       " 'at the other end, and fit tightly in the same, but leave the top edge until the final fit of the drawer. Then \"run\" or fit the sides in — remembering the marks — taking care they fit tight from end to end, and then plane the ends of the back to fit the opening in the same way as the front. The stuff is now ready for gauging and the cutting gauge is the best of the two to use. Gauge the lap on the ends of the front first (see distance A on Fig. 174), and then on both sides of the front ends of the sides (see A, Fig. 175). Then set the gauge to the thickness of the sides, and strike a line from the ends on the inside face of the front (see B, Fig. 174) ; and this same line must be gauged from the end and on both sides of the back. Lastly, the thickness of the back must be gauged in a like manner from the back ends of the sides. It will be noted that, even if a dozen drawers are to be made, the gauge is shifted only three times, and only twice if the back is the same thickness as the sides, which should always happen when the wood is obtainable. In gauging the thicknesses, care must be taken to set the gauge a little under, but never over, or a bad fit is bound to follow. It also might happen that the best planed stuff will \"cast,\" and the sides may cast hollow in the length; whenever this does occur the round side should always be put outside. ',\n",
       " 'The stuff is now ready for setting out and cutting the dovetails. Men of experience are able to just mark ',\n",
       " 'off distances and cut the dovetails quickly and regularly. To those who are less skilled and beginning, a good and simple method is shown in Fig. 176. On the front end of one of the sides square down — with pencil — the lines 1 and 2, % in. from each edge, and then divide the space between these lines for the required number of dovetails. The lines will then become the center of the pins. To set out the dovetails, mark i-i6th in. each side of the line at the top and l /$ in. at the bottom; join these points, and the dovetails are given. The same method can be adopted on the fronts if the holes are to be cut first. There are various methods and many opinions as to which should be done first, but the safest course is to use the one you know and can best apply to the work at hand. We know of no simpler way of setting out dovetails than the one explained ; and it will be noted that the half pin on the outside is left strong enough, whilst the spacing of the pins is regular and at a suitable angle. ',\n",
       " 'In many cases when a drawer sticks it will be found that the place in which it slides, or ought to slide, is the part that requires most attention. ',\n",
       " 'A drawer to run well must be perfectly parallel back and front all around, except that the sides and top and bottom may be eased off to the extent of 1/16 in. to }£ in. at the extreme ends, this easing off to extend to about y 2 in. from the end. For small drawers much less will be sufficient; large drawers may have a little more taken off. ',\n",
       " 'The runners, that is, the wood against which the drawer slides in its receptacle, should not be quite parallel, but a little wider at the back, or the drawer will never run well. Here again it is impossible to give exact measurements. A drawer 1 ft. wide, 6 in. high, and 1 ft. 6 in. long would require the space at the back to be about % in. wider and higher than the front. ',\n",
       " 'One great fault with drawers is that they \"wind,\" that is, if placed on a perfectly flat table, all four corners will not touch the level surface. This is most difficult to rectify. The cause may be bad workmanship or unseasoned wood which has twisted in drying. The high parts may be planed off, but then the drawer will be small, and must be made up to its proper size by gluing on strips of wood ; or the receptacle may be reduced in size. The latter is usually the easier to do. ',\n",
       " 'Suppose that the top long drawer of the 4-ft. chest of drawers which has stuck half-way is to be rectified. Do not use too much force in pulling the handles, or they may come off, or the whole front come away from the sides. Unscrew the back from the carcase, and while a helper pulls at the handles, gently tap the ends at the back with a hammer, a piece of wood being interposed endwise of the grain to act as a punch. Take care to hit the end of the drawer that is farthest in. If this does not move the drawer, it may be necessary to remove the partition between the drawers by sliding it out, and then the runners at the sides of the carcase, by gently prising them out, first previousl yremoving the screws if necessary. ',\n",
       " 'The drawer must be badly jammed if it still remains fixed, and removal to a warmer room had better be tried, and a little time allowed before resorting to stronger measures. ',\n",
       " 'When the drawer is removed, first replace the partition and runners, and ascertain whether the latter are wider apart at the back than at the front. This is best done by cutting a strip of wood the exact length of the opening of the front, and sliding it to the back. If not, the runners must be reduced. Or it may happen that there is no runner, or that it has been forced out of place. ',\n",
       " 'Having got the runners parallel, except for the little play mentioned, next see that they are straight from ',\n",
       " 'back to front; the sides of the carcase may have bulged and bent them. Afterwards do the top and bottom in a similar way. Before and during the process of adjustment, see that the runners do not wind with the front. This can be ascertained by placing the eye about 3 in. from the front of the bottom rail on which the drawer slides and level with it, and observing that the runner ends are in the same plane, by looking first at one end and then the other without moving the eye. This requires practice, and is termed \"taking it out of wind.\" Repeat the process for the under side of the top rail, and adjust the runners as required. ',\n",
       " 'Having got the carcase right, next examine the drawer itself for winding, and whether it is parallel and straight from back to front. If the sides bulge, they can sometimes be knocked in a little. If not, the surplus must be planed off, first making a pencil mark where the parts are not to be planed. ',\n",
       " 'Now try the drawer to see if it will run in. If it goes half way, take off a little with a plane (or scraper if the wood is hard) where it is tight. Run it in and out several times, and see where it shines, and carefully remove the shine. Avoid taking any off the edge of the front as long as possible, or it will be too small and a bad fit. In shutting or opening a well-fitting drawer, a little friction should be felt for the whole length. ',\n",
       " 'The sides and top and bottom edges should next be well smoothed with middle and fine sand paper until ',\n",
       " 'they shine. Finally they and the runners should be rubbed with spermaceti wax, and then with a linen rag, using plenty of pressure. Spermaceti sometimes crumbles away when used. If so, melt it at a low heat in a jar, pour into a cardboard box, and keep it there, cutting down the edges as required. Nothing need be added when using on wood ; but for the joints of brass mathematical instruments, add 10 per cent of vaseline. ',\n",
       " \"Veneering which we will first deal with, consists of laying an expensive or highly figured wood upon a foundation of a cheaper or more common wood. It does not always meet with approval, the prevailing idea being that if a piece of cabinet-work is veneered it is cheap; but a moment's consideration would convince the most incredulous that the finest effects in the works are to be obtained only by this process. It is a fact also that veneering gives greater strength to articles of furniture than if they were solidly made. Among the valuable woods for the purpose many are obtained from the far East, even the remote Siam and the Philippines furnishing supplies. Some of the most exquisitely colored and figured woods are only obtainable in small pieces, and are used for ornamental inlay designs, in devising and applying which the Hollanders are so expert that cabinets, tables, desks and other articles thus treated by them are imported here and find ready sale. \",\n",
       " 'The best figured and most ornamental wood is usually to be found at the butt end of the tree, though good mottle may be obtained at the junction of the trunk and limbs. In buying timber for veneering purposes, only long experience can determine its quality and worth ; the external appearance is not always a true index of the internal, and it is often a matter of chance, ',\n",
       " '\"Sawn.\" — This term is applied to all veneers that are cut by saw. The log is placed upon a travelling platform, the fine saws being set in a vertical frame and cutting the veneers simultaneously through the log. The usual number of veneers to the inch is ten, but, if desired, twelve may be obtained; the latter are, however, thin, and not so serviceable. The veneers are numbered consecutively, so that \"match\" veneers may easily be determined. The ends should be bound with muslin to prevent splitting. Veneers to be in proper workable order must be kept in a damp place; they are then much more pliable, and less liable to crack. The waste of timber in cutting by this method is, roughly speaking, about $i of an inch per inch of thickness. ',\n",
       " '\"Knife-cut.\" — By this method there is no waste whatever. The log, having been opened up, is steamed, and, while saturated with moisture, placed under the knife. This works horizontally, and takes off the thinnest shaving possible. The usual number of veneers obtained per inch of thickness is from thirty-six to forty ; they are therefore almost as thin as paper, and not at all reliable for hard wear or subsequent scraping and repolishing. Knife-cut veneers should only be used on ',\n",
       " 'those parts of a job that are not liable to constant wear; the only advantage — and that a doubtful one — which they possess is that the veneer will \"lie\" more readily upon a sweep or on the flat owing to its thinness, and ',\n",
       " 'with a reduction in time there is a corresponding abatement in price. Apart from economic reasons, a \"sawn\" veneer should always be used. ',\n",
       " 'Veneering. — Any wood is suitable for veneering upon, but those usually selected are of the \"bay-wood\" or pines. The foundation, having been faced up, is \"toothed\" by a special hand plane, thus imparting a rough surface to the wood which will enable the glue to adhere more firmly. A solution of size and water used hot is next applied and allowed to dry. The heart side of a board should always be veneered upon, and the ',\n",
       " 'reverse side damped with water to prevent the board going round when sized. Lay the board face down until ready for veneering. The veneer may now be laid, and can be done in two ways — by hand or machine. ',\n",
       " 'For small works, mouldings, or sweeps, use the former method ; for panels, carcase ends, etc., the latter. ',\n",
       " 'Process i. — Quickly brush over with hot glue, taking care to spread it evenly. The veneer may then be laid down, pressed by hand to remove the air, and squeezed down by means of a \"caul,\" removing all blisters and superfluous glue.

       " 'In the case of sweeps, either a steel bow-cramp contracted to the shape, or a wooden template secured by means of cramps, should be used. ',\n",
       " 'this purpose is shown at Fig. 172 and comprises an iron framework with perforated cast top, a series of gasburners running at intervals of 9 inches or so the length of the machine, and over this an iron plate covered by a sheet of zinc. The gas having been turned on and the plate heated, the job to be veneered is laid on the machine, and cramps are then placed across and tightened down by means of set-screws, until the air between the foundation and the veneer is excluded, and ',\n",
       " 'the superfluous glue squeezed out. This may be easily ascertained by a tap on the panel, a hollow sound indicating that the veneer is not bedded. When the veneer has been laid, turn off the gas and leave the job to cool naturally, say, through the night, the cramps remaining ',\n",
       " 'on. After standing for three days, the work may be finished off. It will be found that some of the glue has oozed through the pores of the veneer, while a general roughness is apparent. Proceed with an ordinary iron scraper or iron plane to smooth down (the latter is better if the veneer is thick enough, as the scraper may get too warm and soften the glue beneath), and finish with sand-paper upon a cork rubber. The job is then ready for the polisher. ',\n",
       " 'The butt-joint (Fig. 178) is a most effective way of veneering a drawerfront or panel. Take two \"match\" veneers — that is, consecutive members — as cut from the log, cut through each where it is desired to butt, thus ',\n",

The veneer is then laid upon the foundation, and a few needle points or tacks placed on each side the joint, a strip of brown paper being glued upon the same to hold it in position. When dry, lay as before described. ',\n",

       " 'Fig. 181. — The addition of a stringing is often advantageous to break the line of junction and throw up the center, a narrow band of the veneer being removed for this purpose by means of a cutting gauge. ',\n",
       " 'Fig. 182. — If there is a defect or hole in a veneer, a new piece should be inserted matching the curl or mottle of the wood, the edges of which should be cut to the shape of the curl or follow the line of the grain.

       " \"This most important branch of the wood-working trade seldom gets the attention it deserves, the common idea being that there is nothing in polishing demanding skill or judgment, or even worth the trouble of knowing. No greater mistake than this could be made. Polishers have in their hands the making or marring of the finished piece of furniture from the cabinet-maker's bench. Briefly, the process of Frenchpolishing consists in the application of various gums, lacs, etc., dissolved in spirit, in order to give to the wood a surface or polish (bright or dull as required) which not only preserves the wood, but brings out the beauty of the grain. \",\n",
       " 'Workshop and Fittings. — The workshop should be a large well-ventilated building, with a north light for preference and also top lights. It should be kept heated to a given temperature, say 60 degrees F , and be maintained at this heat night and day. Hot-water pipes around the walls, with regulating valves, will probably give the best results; steam-pipes may be used, but do not maintain such an equable temperature. A small enclosed coke-stove or gas-burner is an essential for the purpose of melting wax, obtaining hot water, etc. ',\n",

       " 'Trestles are required varying in height from 9 inches to 30 inches, and loose tops of different lengths and widths for placing on them. Several wooden battens covered with felt to protect a job are also necessary. ',\n",
       " 'Materials. — It need hardly be said that upon the quality of the materials used in polishing depends very largely the ultimate results, good or bad. And here, as in other branches of trade, the best is always the cheapest. It will be found a mistake to lay in too much stock, as polish quickly evaporates and other materials deteriorate, but rather to buy small quantities of lac, spirit, &c, and mix fresh as required. ',\n",
       " 'Not much in the way of plant is needed to fit a polishing shop : — say, half a dozen pint (and a few larger) stoppered bottles for polish, glaze, finish, varnish, &c. ; a few jars of stain, oil, fillers; and tin canisters for keeping rubbers, more valued by the polisher than any part of his kit. ',\n",
       " 'How to make a rubber. — Get a piece of clean white or gray wadding, remove the skin from it, and roll it into an Qgg shape, then cover the same with a thin linen rag strained tightly over the wadding, holding the ends in the palm of the hand, the two forefingers and thumb bedding themselves on the extremity of the rubber, flat',\n",
       " 'ten the under side or polishing surface, and you will have an oval flat of, say, 3 by 2 inches. The proper size of the rubber depends upon the polisher himself and the class of work engaged on. ',\n",
       " 'If new linen or calico prints be used, they should be washed to remove all trace of lime or dressing, and be as soft and pliable as possible. A different rubber should be used for different polishes, and they are so easy and inexpensive to make, there is no reason why work should be clouded through dirty rubbers. Cleanliness and good polishing go hand in hand. When the rubber is finished with, it should be kept in an air-tight canister. It will thus keep soft, and may be used repeatedly. Failure to do this will result in hardness, which renders it useless. We are now ready to commence work and proceed to the first page, viz : — ',\n",
       " 'Filling-in. — This consists of coating the surface of the wood with a filler, which closes or fills up the grain, thus making it possible to get a perfectly smooth surface for polishing and also saving time and material in the afterwork. Upon the efficiency of the filling-in depends the result of the finished job. There are many good fillers on the market, any one of which might be equally well adopted, but it is much better that the polisher should make his own polishes, &c, and many men prefer to do so. Consequently no two polishers use exactly the same formula, but work upon receipts best adapted to their own particular style. Before filling-in, the work ',\n",
       " 'should be as finely papered down as possible. Too much stress cannot be laid on this point, for if well done at first much after-labor will be saved. The filler can then be put on with a flannel, and rubbed into the grain of the wood until the pores are filled up, then wipe all off and paper down. This will be found necessary, because the filler will have raised the grain. When dry, the work will be ready for the next process, bodying-up. ',\n",
       " 'The following fillers will be found useful. The exact proportions can be ascertained when mixing, remembering that the filler must just be of the consistency to work freely. ',\n",
       " 'Fillers. — (i) Spirit varnish laid on with a brush; this forms a good quick filler. Two coats should be given. ',\n",
       " '(2) Size. — Ordinary glue size may be used as a filler in the case of hard-grained wood, and will answer the purpose. ',\n",
       " '(4) Whiting and Linseed-oil. — Mix these together into a paste and apply with a flannel. This is a filler generally adopted. ',\n",
       " 'The disadvantage in Nos. 3 and 4 is that there is a great liability to get the job greasy, which will afterwards work its way through the polish, giving the surface a cobweb effect which is known as \"sweating.\" ',\n",
       " 'and apply to the job, and rub off as quickly as possible. This filler is undoubtedly the cleanest and most effectual that can be used, and entirely obviates \"sweating.\" ',\n",
       " '(6) Whiting and Turpentine. — Mix into a paste, and apply as before. This is preferred by many to No. 5. ',\n",
       " 'Thus far these fillers are in the white, and suitable only for such woods as ash, maple, satinwood, birch, &c. In the case of dark-colored woods the filler should be tinted with rose-pink or Venetian red ; ebonized work, lamp-black; oak, walnut woods, &c, chromes, ochres, and umbers according to the tone required. ',\n",
       " 'Bodying-up. — We now come to the second stage of polishing. The wood having been papered down with fine old glass paper, take a rubber, previously described, and sprinkle a little polish onto it from the stock bottle ; then cover over with a rag, holding the ends tightly in the palm of the hand, and tap the rubber against the palm of the other hand, which will cause the polish to distribute itself over the whole rubber; put a spot of linseed-oil on with the finger, and the rubber is ready for work. Commence very lightly at one corner of the work, if it be a panel or carcase end, and by a series of motions forming interlacing curves, gradually work over the entire surface, never lifting the rubber until at the edge of the job. Care must be taken not to have the rubber too full of polish, or to press on the work too hard, in which case the polish will ooze out of the rubber and leave nasty ridges on the job ; the idea is how ',\n",
       " 'best to cover the entire work evenly. Having done this, let the job stand as long as possible — a few days will do no harm, — -the shellac will then have sunk into the wood, the spirit evaporating. This will present a dull appearance, and feel rough to the touch. We then proceed to paper down again, in fact too much stress cannot be placed upon the value of judicious sand-papering. After this the operation is repeated until a good body of polish is obtained on the work. Be very sparing of using oil; though this eases the rubber, it ruins the \\'job ultimately. After another papering or pumice-stoning down we can pass to the final stage, spiriting-off. It may be asked, how many times is it necessary to go over the work ? This very much depends on the wood worked upon. It will be anything from three to six times, the object being to obtain a body, hard and that will not sink. Much of the modern work is completely ruined to-day because it is \"rushed.\" Time is not allowed between the rubbers, consequently no proper foundation is obtained, and in six months\\' time the job requires redoing. The method described above will apply equally to either light, or dark woods, the difference being in the polish used rather than the method. Spiriting-off. — This process may be called the most difficult portion of French-polishing, and when once proficient in this a man may be said to know his trade. The process is similar to bodying-up, with this exception, that towards the last \"spirits\" only are used on ',\n",
       " 'the rubber. This has the effect of polishing the \"lac\" put on during bodying-up, and giving to the work a fine, hard, bright surface ; the oil previously worked in is spirited out. ',\n",
       " 'Commence by using, say, two parts of polish to one of spirit, then equal parts, afterwards two of spirit to one of polish, and thus gradually reducing the polish to nil, and using only pure spirit. The rubber and motions are as previously described. A clean rubber should be used when pure spirit only is used, and a series of straight motions taken instead of the circular ones, running the same direction as the grain of the wood. ',\n",
       " 'Small mouldings, angles, awkward corners, &c, which would be very difficult to spirit off in the ordinary way, may be done by \"glazing.\" Applied with a rubber and worked straight along the moulds, this glaze quickly dries, and has the same appearance as if spirited-off. It is, however, softer, and will not stand wear. Much of this work could be obviated if the polisher were given the job in pieces; for instance, mouldings mitred around panels should be polished in long lengths, and cut and fitted afterwards, thus avoiding nasty corners. Turned work is better polished in the lathe, before being framed up. Panels should be polished before framing up, or if beaded in, left loose for that purpose. ',\n",
       " 'difficulty in mixing polishes, and every man should be able to do so, the process simply consisting in dissolving shellac in methylated spirit. This latter should be bought at 60 over-proof, stored in a cool place, and tightly sealed, as it soon evaporates. ',\n",
       " 'Shellac is orange in color; the lighter the color the purer the quality. It is in small flakes, and requires crushing before dissolving in the spirits. This would be used for ordinary polish. If, however, a clear or white polish is desired, then bleached shellac is used. This is in lumps, and must be crushed before using. This lac must be kept in water. Coloring pigments can be added to any polish to intensify it as desired, such as Bismarck or Vandyke brown. These polishes should be mixed cold — the shellac will take a little longer to dissolve, but the operation is much safer, — then strain through muslin, and put in stoppered bottles. ',\n",
       " 'Brown Polish. — (1) 1 pint methylated spirit, 4 oz. orange shellac, Yi oz. sandarac; or (3) 1 pint methylated spirit, 4 oz. orange shellac, y 2 oz. sandarac, 94 oz. benzoin. ',\n",

       " 'preparations which are used to restore furniture which has already been polished, but has through neglect or other cause become cloudy. The first thing to be done in a case of this kind is to thoroughly wash the woodwork with a flannel soaped with curd soap and warm water; by this means all dirt and grease will be removed. After wiping down with a soft dry duster, apply one or other of the following revivers, and polish off with another clean duster. Much of the old polish will thus be brought back. ',\n",
       " 'Reviver No. i. — Take equal parts of methylated spirit, linseed-oil, and malt vinegar. Mix well and shake before using. ',\n",

This will set in a light paste, and prove an excellent polisher. \",\n",
       " 'Repairs. — When a bruise has to be made good upon a job the best plan to adopt is as follows : — Raise the bruise by means of a hot iron placed upon a damp cloth. This, unless the wood is broken, will lift it to its original level, it may then be sand-papered off and polished. ',\n",
       " 'Bleaching. — It sometimes happens that some parts of the wood are darker than the rest, in which event it is most important that the darker parts be reduced to ',\n",
       " 'the lighter. This result is produced by bleaching. Dissolve i oz. of oxalic acid in half a pint of water, and apply with a rag; when dry, paper down, and if the density is not sufficiently reduced, repeat the operation until the desired result is obtained. ',\n",
       " 'Sweating-out. — When too much oil has been used on the job, the surface presents a cobweb appearance which gradually increases and eats the polish away. When first detected, it may be removed with warm water, soap, and flannel; but when of long standing, nothing can be done to remove it except repolishing. ',\n",
       " 'This is the process of treating oak with ammonia, darkening it by this means to any required shade. This result can be achieved in two ways. ',\n",
       " '(1st.) Natural fumigation, that is, exposing the oak work in a sealed chamber to the fumes of ammonia until the required density is obtained. ',\n",
       " 'The ammonia used should be a solution of ammonia gas in water, and should have a specific gravity of 880. This must, on account of its volatile nature, be kept in a well-stoppered bottle. ',\n",
       " 'Process 1. — To fumigate by this means a separate chamber is required. This may be an ordinary room or a fuming-cabinet built in the corner of the polishing shop. In either case it must be air-tight, and the door opening into it should have a square of glass for observation purposes. When the oak work has been placed within it, take, say 1 pint of ammonia and fill about a dozen saucers placed upon the floor. The door must then be closed, and sealed up by means of brown paper pasted round the joints. The process of fuming then begins, and can be watched through the glass until the desired shade is obtained. The smaller the chamber the quicker will the work be done; the time may vary from six to twelve hours according to the strength ',\n",
       " 'of the ammoniated atmosphere. Practice alone will determine the time for opening the chamber. This is the only reliable and safe way of fumigating; in fact all other processes are but imitations of it, and the product of \"cheapness and rush.\" ',\n",
       " 'The advantages of this process are : ( i ) that as no liquid touches the job the grain is not raised, consequently sand-papering is avoided; (2) the ammonia fumes penetrate deeper into the wood than by outward application; (3) the exact density can be more easily determined. ',\n",
       " 'The disadvantages are : ( 1 ) This process requires a separate room for the purpose; (2) It takes much more time than is required by the direct application of ammonia. ',\n",
       " 'In connection with natural fuming it will be noticed that some parts of the job may not \"take\" at all. This often arises from the fact that various oaks have been used in its construction. Thus \"Oak grown in one part of America may be susceptible to the fumes, while oak grown in another state, will not.\" Those parts which have not \"taken\" must then be treated by Process 2, and care must be exercised that the resultant color may be the same. Let the ammonia for this purpose be very weak. Let it dry before applying another coat (if necessary), as it is much easier to intensify than to bleach, and nothing looks worse than a patchy job. ',\n",
       " 'Process 2. — This consists in the application of liquid ammonia (.880 spec, grav.) direct on to the work. It is usually applied with a sponge or rag. Water may be added to weaken the solution if only a light tint is desired. The wood immediately darkens upon the surface, but allowances should be made for its drying lighter. The objection to this process is that it raises the grain, which entails sand-papering down, while process No. 1 does not. This necessarily takes away much of the sharpness of the mouldings, the fillets suffering most of all. In this case it will be found that the work does not take the dye evenly, and the same shading or toning to a color will be found necessary to produce a good result. ',\n",
       " 'In either process the job should be in the white, that is, without brass or copper work or silvered plates, as these are liable to be affected by the ammonia fumes. ',\n",
       " 'Finishing. — The work, having been fumed by either of the foregoing processes, is now ready for finishing, and the usual way is either of the following: — (1) Egg-shell finish ; (2) Wax finish. ',\n",
       " '(1) Apply a thin rubber of ordinary polish to the job, and dull down with powdered pumice-stone and a stiff brush. This will give a dull shine without in any way filling the grain of the wood. (2) Dissolve pure bees\\'-wax in turpentine, and apply with a rag, rubbing well in, and obtaining a polish by \"elbow grease.\" This is a more tedious process than the former, but much ',\n",
       " \"more satisfactory, as this process can be carried on after the job has left the polisher's hands and the polish will constantly improve. \",\n",
       " 'Mahogany is the only other wood that will \"fume.\" It assumes a purple tint, and should be treated in the same manner as oak. ',\n",
       " 'This method of producing a polish was undoubtedly the earliest adopted by cabinetmakers, and is best suited to the finishing of dark oak, chestnut, and some other woods. The advantage appears to consist in the fact that the process is never complete, and, like Tennyson\\'s \"Brook,\" may go on forever. Much of the beauty of a piece of sixteenth-century carved oak is due to the polishing, — the result of years of rubbing — by use. ',\n",
       " \"In wax-polishing two ingredients only are necessary, bees'-wax and turpentine. The wax should be melted, and sufficient turpentine added to form an easy workable paste ; do not heat the turpentine or pour it into the melted wax while the latter is still on the fire, as it is highly inflammable. As all the turpentine must evaporate before the polishing is complete — leaving the wax to act as both filler and polisher, — no more should be added at the commencement than necessary, otherwise the work will be prolonged. If the stock sets hard it can be softened again by warming, but it is better to mix it in small quantities as required. The safest method of warming or melting all ingredients in the polish-shop is by steam, using a kettle or double pan, such as the cabinet-makers use for glue. This point is one not lost sight of by insurance companies. \",\n",

If the latter, we shall rub down with ^sand-paper; if the former, this will be unnecessary. By means of a flannel boss we apply the wax-polish, rubbing the panels in circular motion till every part receives an equal polish. The work may now with advantage be laid aside until the next day, when the process may be repeated. Let \"a little and often\" be the motto, — a little, in order that no clogging of wax occurs in the corners and mouldings, all the wax being rubbed in until an even bright surface is obtained, free from all tackiness or finger marking ; and often, so that each thin coat may have a chance to sink into the grain and by the evaporation of the turpentine harden. Remember that the polish is produced not by the amount of wax used but by \"elbow-grease.\" ',\n",

This is a wooden case (say) 12x8x6 inches, weighted inside with iron or lead to 14 lbs, ; attached to this is a handle 6 feet long, working on a swivel, and thus allowing a sweep of 6 feet or so in each direction, in other words a clear swing of 12 feet or more. Upon the bottom of this case tack a piece of clean felt and proceed to polish. ',\n",

This will evenly spread the wax and take up all superfluous quantities; it will also produce a certain amount of polish which can afterwards be brought up to a great brilliancy by the finishing felt polisher. This method would also be used in preparing the floor of a ballroom, which might afterwards be kept in condition by the sprinkling and rubbing-in of French chalk. ',\n",
       " 'If wax polishing was the original method of treating oak, it may be said with equal truth that oil-polishing was the method of finishing mahogany in. the days when French-polishing was unknown; in fact, it is questionable whether any of the seventeenth and eighteenth-century work was dealt with in any other manner. Chippendale, Sheraton, and their contemporaries certainly adopted it as best suited to their work, and the untouched jobs handed down prove their decision to have been right. ',\n",
       " \"The great objection to oil-polishing is the length of time required to produce a good result; in fact, the longer you go on, the better it is. This fact has in these days of speed completely put oil-polishing in the background; the manufacturer wants a speedy return for his capital, and the public require their furniture the day after they give the order, so that it is impossible to have a job in the polisher's hands a month, and speedier methods have consequently been adopted. \",\n",
       " 'It is unquestionable that oil-polishing will bring up the figure of mahogany and enrich its color better than any other method, and if time permits, it is, for large work (such as panelling, dadoes, doors, screens, counter tops, &c), the very best way of polishing. ',\n",

       " 'The revolving apparatus can also be made by fastening two or more castors or wheels to the lower side of the base. These castors roll over a metal plate fastened to the upper side of the fixed base. The latter is attached to the revolving part by a spindle, which passes through the frame and the base, and is secured by nuts. ',\n",

       " 'Chairs. — Although chairs have an infinite variety of form, as we have shown, they are constructed on nearly the same principles. No. i, Fig. 184, is an illustration of the framework of a chair suitable for a sitting-room. The hind part consists of two long pieces of squared stuff, to which are mortised two horizontal upper rails forming the back, a third at the level of the seat, and a fourth below. These back legs are usually curved backwards above and below the seat, so that the chairback has a slight slope and so that the feet are spread out sufficiently to prevent tilting. The front legs are joined by two rails, and are also fastened to the back by the same number. The tenons of the upper rails may come up. flush with the top of the leg, as shown in the illustration, or can be fitted into an ordinary mortise. The width of the rails at the level of the seat depends upon the nature of the upholstery; if springs are to be fitted, they are about three inches wide. The bottom rails are omitted in some chairs of heavy build, or the side pairs of legs are connected by rails and the middle of these joined by a cross-piece. ',\n",
       " 'All the parts of bedroom chairs, with the exception of the backs, are, as a rule, turned. The two back legs project above the seat to form the back, and are joined by two horizontal bars, which are slightly curved and joined to the vertical pieces by shallow mortises cut ',\n",
       " 'in the latter. The joint is further strengthened by screws passed from the front through counter-sunk holes, ',\n",
       " 'the heads being afterwards covered by small turned beads glued in, or if the chair is to be painted, the holes can be filled with wooden plugs. The lower rails are turned, and their rounded ends fit into corresponding ',\n",
       " 'holes bored in the legs, where they are secured by glue. Sometimes only the front legs are turned, the back legs ',\n",
       " 'Figure 184a being left square and bent slightly outwards. The seats of such chairs are made of four flat pieces of wood ',\n",
       " 'about I inch thick mortised together, the front and back pieces overlapping the other two, and the back piece being shorter than that at the front. The corners and edges are slightly rounded, and sometimes the front piece is curved, as are also the sides. The front legs fit into the holes bored in the under side of the seat, and the back legs are fitted to the seat by grooves y 2 inch deep cut in the former. Rounded backs are made by cutting the upper ends of the back legs to form part of a circle, and fitting across these a curved piece of wood. This is attached by mortise-and-tenon joints, or by dowels. The lower cross-bar is cut in a similar manner, so that, when the four are joined together, the back has the form of a segment of a circle or ellipse. ',\n",
       " 'Drawing-room chairs are framed in a somewhat similar manner. Turned or fretted bars are sometimes inserted in the back, either horizontally or vertically, or part of the back is upholstered. The legs are squared, tapered, and slightly curved ; or they are also turned and fluted, or left plain and carved. ',\n",
       " 'No. 2, Fig. 184, shows the frame work of an armchair. The only difference between this and No. 1 is that the back is higher, the seat larger, and four extra rails forming the arms are added. The latter may be upholstered, or not, according to the design of the chair; turned spindles are sometimes inserted between them and the seat. The back of the arm-chair is sometimes slightly curved, and the seat may be made ',\n",

       " 'In office chairs and others of a similar type the four legs are mortised to the wooden seat, which is made slightly hollow towards the middle part. The curved back is made up of several pieces, which are cut to form a curve and mortised or doweled together. It is attached to the seat by a series of turned or square vertical bars fixed by mortises, the two at the ends in front being stouter than the others. An extra piece of curved wood with a rounded edge is sometimes fixed to the middle part of the top of the back to serve as a shoulder-rest. When the seat is made to swivel round, the legs bend inwards, and meet at a small block of wood faced with metal, upon which the seat revolves. Office chairs are sometimes slightly upholstered instead of being left altogether plain. ',\n",
       " 'The framework of an easy-chair is almost the same as that of an arm-chair, but the side rails which support the seat are much wider, the legs are shorter and thicker, and the seat stretches farther back. The back is not so high, and is made to slope slightly. The space between the arms and seat may be left open, filled with carved or turned work, or covered with upholstery. Some settees are made after the manner of large easy-chairs, wide enough to contain two or three persons; the framework of such is the same, but the seat and back are strengthened by additional crosspieces. ',\n",
       " 'Music Stools. — These are made either with a fixed top, or with a top that can be raised. The former have four legs and the top is round or square. The legs sometimes slope slightly outwards towards the feet to obtain greater stability. In the plainer kind of stool, ',\n",

The coarse screws cut at the top of the legs are not turned on the lathe when they are being shaped, but are made subsequently with the aid of a \"box-screw.\" This is a rectangular block of wood with a handle at either end, and pierced by a hole in which a female screw corresponding to the male screw is cut. The top end of the leg is turned down for about Ij4 or 2 inches till it fits into one end of the hole, when it is pushed in and turned round at the same time, the screw being cut by a small knife inside. This method of joining legs is only used for light pieces of furniture and fancy tables, the legs beingusually attached by mortise-and-tenon joints. ',\n",
       " 'Stools with movable seats have a stout turned pillar to with three curved feet are fastened by mortise-andtenon joints, meeting it about 6 inches from the ground. The top of the pillar is cut off flat and a hole 9 inches deep bored down it.

       " 'Sofas and Settees. — The framework of a sofa is shown in No. 1, Fig. 185. The four legs, which are represented simply as square blocks of wood, are fitted to the front and back rails with mortise-and-tenon joints. The upper part where the mortises are cut is generally made pretty stout to ensure strength, and ',\n",
       " 'any resulting clumsiness is concealed by the upholstery. The lower part is tapered, carved, or turned. The front and back rails are strengthened by an additional crosspiece placed midway, and a similar cross-piece is fitted to the back, which is otherwise similar to the arm of an easy-chair. A method of fastening the head of the sofa is shown in the illustration; it consists of two rails mortised to the front and back legs in a slanting position, and strengthened by two cross-pieces. These rails are generally carved, and the front edges of both moulded. The outside of the front rail may also be carved. The top rail of the back is sometimes curved downwards until it meets the back rail of the lower frame, being made of two or more pieces mortised or doweled together. The space between the two is sometimes rilled with turned bars. In order to obtain lightness, each pair of legs is sometimes joined by two slight rails placed 2 or 3 inches apart instead of by a solid rail. ',\n",
       " 'The framework of the simple square settee is shown in No. 2, Fig. 185. As all the woodwork of this is usually hidden by upholstery which reaches nearly down to the floor, it is made of common wood and receives no high degree of finish. The four legs are turned at the lower end and left square at the upper. The four rails which form the seat are mortised into the sides of the legs, as are also the three rails which form the back and ends. ',\n",
       " 'The back can be further strengthened, if necessary, by inserting two diagonal bars. These settees are made in a great variety of forms, from that above described to the lighter and more elegant pieces of furniture which are embellished with turned work and only partly upholstered. Sometimes the four legs which form the end-pieces are turned and the seat-frame inserted in notches cut in these, and so upholstered that the lower part of the latter and all the legs are visible.

       " 'Settees for billiard-rooms are framed similarly to arm-chairs (see No. 2, Fig. 184). They are generally made about 6 or 7 feet long, and either straight or bent to suit corners. The woodwork of a billiard-room settee is shown in Fig. 186. The parts are more massive than those of ordinary settees. The legs are made of 3-in. scantling, those at the front being turned, whilst the other pair are bent slightly backwards. The settee stands on a platform about 8 inches high, and of such and sides. The two front corners of the platform are slightly rounded. When the settee is not intended to be placed on a platform, the legs are made longer and a foot-rest is fastened to the front about 6 inches from the floor. This is made of i-inch stuff with rounded edges ; it is fastened at the back into grooves cut in the front legs, and in front is supported on stout turned feet. ',\n",

The seat is y 2 inch less in width than the sides, and comes up flush at the front, thus leaving a space Yi inch wide for the back. It may be attached to the sides by cutting at each end a rounded tenon 2 inches wide. These tenons project about ij^ inch through mortises cut in the end-pieces. Half-round holes are cut through these projecting pieces so that they are flush with the sides. When the seat is in its place, a peg made by cutting a piece of tapering turned wood in a longitudinal ',\n",

The sides and back are similar to those of an arm-chair. The four legs are usually of 2-inch scantling; the two back legs project above the seat and are joined by two horizontal i-inch rails, one at the top and the other nearly at the level of the seat. Two rails, which are fitted with panels, join each pair of legs and form the sides of the box. Panels of ^ -inch stuff are grooved to these. The framing of the lid is formed of ',\n",

       " 'Staining is the process of imparting to the surface of wood a color different from its natural one. It consists of two varieties, surface-staining and body-staining. In the former, as the name implies, the staining is effected by various compounds in the nature of pigments, laid upon the surface like paint, and forming a thin opaque coating, which does not, to any considerable degree, affect the fibre of the wood. In the latter the changes are chemical, the stain being usually applied as a thin wash, which, entering the pores of the wood, colors it to some depth below the surface. Staining requires no preliminary preparation, the stain being applied directly to the wood. As most stains raise the grain of the wood to a considerable extent, it is necessary before applying the varnish, to sand-paper the wood enough to render the grain quite smooth; this sometimes renders a second coat necessary, after which the sand-paper must be again applied.

After this purificatory process, they should be dried in the open air for at least twelve hours. They are then ready for the copper. By these simple means the color will strike much quicker, and be of a brighter hue.

       " 'Gilding, Silvering and Bronzing are processes of applying to previously prepared surfaces a thin layer of gold or silver leaf, or in bronzing, of a fine powder, prepared from various metals and intended to imitate the peculiar appearance of genuine bronze. The processes of gilding and silvering being identical, the description of one will suffice to explain the other. ',\n",
       " 'Gilding. — Gold leaf, applied to articles of furniture as a means of decoration, is used in two ways; it is applied over an ordinary varnish or other finish, in which case but little special preparation is necessary; or, as when used for picture frames, cornices, etc., it is applied to a specially prepared foundation, the basis of which is whiting, mixed with various other ingredients suggested by experience or fancy. In either case, the gold leaf is caused to adhere to the work, by size specially prepared for the purpose, receipts for which follow herewith; the size being first applied to the work, and when it has become of the right consistency, the gold is laid upon it. Oil-Gilding and Burnish-Gilding are different methods used to obtain certain desired effects, the former principally for articles exposed to the weather, and for heightening the effect of incised carving or engraving, and the latter for picture-frames and articles having a specially prepared foundation, whose entire surface is. to be gilded. It is intended that the ',\n",
       " 'gold shall adhere to the work only in the places to which the size has been applied, but the smallest portion of oil or even a slight dampness may cause the gold to partially adhere to the adjoining surface, resulting in slightly ragged edges; to prevent this, before applying the size to the desired design, the entire surface is covered with a thin film of some substance perfectly free from moisture, and easily removable by water, after completion of the process. Directions regarding this preliminary process are given under the caption: To Prevent Gold Adhering. ',\n",
       " 'The Requisites. — First, a sufficient quantity of leafgold, which is of two sorts — the deep gold, as it is called, and the pale gold. The former is the best; the latter very useful, and may occasionally be introduced for variety or effect. ',\n",
       " \"Second, a gilder's cushion : an oblong piece of wood, covered with rough calf-skin, stuffed with flannel several times doubled, with a border of parchment, about four inches deep, at one end, to prevent the air blowing the leaves about when placed on the cushion. \",\n",
       " \"Fourthly, several camel-hair pencils in sizes, and tips, made of a few long camel's hairs put between two cards, in the same manner as hairs are put into tin cases for brushes, thus making a flat brush with a very few hairs. \",\n",
       " 'Sizes. — These are of two kinds: oil sizes are those which when applied, present an adhesive surface, requiring the immediate laying of the gold-leaf upon it ; of this class is the oil-size commonly used in decorating furniture; water-sizes are those that are allowed to become dry and hard when applied, and are rendered adhesive when the gold is to be laid, by brushing over with water; for burnish-gilding these are always employed, as oil-size does not dry sufficiently hard to permit of burnishing. ',\n",
       " 'Oil-Size for Oil-Gilding. — Grind calcined red-ochre with the best and oldest drying-oil. When desired for use, add sufficient oil of turpentine to make it work freely. ',\n",
       " 'Parchment-Size. — For preparing Frames, etc. — To half a pound of parchment shavings, or cuttings of white leather, add three quarts of water, and boil it in a proper vessel till reduced to nearly-half the quantity; then take it off the fire, and strain it through a sieve. Be careful in the boiling to keep it well stirred, and do not let burn. ',\n",
       " 'Gold-Size for Burnish-Gilding. — Grind fine salammoniac well with a muller and stone ; scrape into it a little beef suet, and grind all well together; after which, mix in with a pallet-knife a small proportion of parchment-size with a double proportion of water. ',\n",
       " 'Another. — Grind a lump of tobacco-pipe clay into a very stiff paste with thin size ; add a small quantity of ruddle and fine black lead, ground very fine, and temper the whole with a small piece of tallow. When ready to use, reduce with parchment-size until it will just flow from the brush. ',\n",
       " 'Another. — Grind separately in water, i lb. Armenian bole, 2 ozs. red lead, a sufficient quantity of black lead ; mix, and regrind with a small quantity of olive oil. Reduce with parchment-size to the proper consistency. ',\n",
       " 'To Prevent Gold Adhering. — Either one of the following methods will prevent gold-leaf or bronze from adhering to the surface beyond the outlines of the sizing laid on to receive it : ',\n",
       " '2. Whiting mixed in water, and applied with a soft brush. When the water has evaporated, dust off the superfluous whiting with an ordinary paint duster. By this method a very thin coating of whiting remains, which is free from any grittiness. One advantage gained by the use of whiting thus applied is, it furnishes a whitish ground over which clear varnish or oil-size may be distinctly seen as the striping progresses. After the leaf or bronze has been applied, the work must be carefully washed, so as to insure the removal of the whiting. ',\n",
       " '4. A thin wash of starch water, either brushed on with a flat camel-hair brush, or applied with a soft sponge. ',\n",
       " '5. Take ball liquorice and water, a weak solution, and apply with a soft brush. This may be kept in a bottle ready for use at any time. ',\n",
       " '6. Cut a new potato in two, and rub over the part to be sized with the raw face exposed, allowing the juice to remain until dry. ',\n",
       " 'It will be observed that any substance which interposes a film over the varnish, itself being free from tackiness and readily removed by water, will answer the purpose. ',\n",
       " 'Oil Gilding. — Applying the Gold. — If the wood to be gilded is finished with varnish or otherwise, no additional foundation is necessary upon which to lay the gold-leaf; if the wood is not finished, after it has been smoothed and dusted, give it one or two coats of parchment size, after it is perfectly dry and hard, again smoothing the surface with fine sand-paper. That the gold may not adhere to any part of the work except where the size is hard, powder the surface lightly with whiting from a pounce-bag, which is a small bag made of material sufficiently loose to permit the powdered whiting to sift through as fine dust; if preferred, any of the preceding receipts for that purpose can be used ',\n",
       " 'instead. Remove the surplus whiting with the dustingbrush, and the work is then ready for the size. Apply this with a sable or fit brush of the proper size, carefully observing to make the outer lines of the design clear and sharp, that the work may not appear ragged. Let the size remain until it feels tacky, when the gold may be applied. This is the most difficult part of the operation, and experience is necessary before gold-leaf can be laid smoothly without a wrinkle or a break. Turn a leaf of gold out of the book upon the cushion; breathe gently upon the center of the leaf and it will lay flat on the cushion; cut it to the proper size by bringing the knife perpendicularly over it, and sawing it gently until divided. Take your tip (a brush used for the purpose) and after drawing it lightly over your hair to remove any particles of dust that may be upon it, breathe upon it gently, which will dampen it sufficiently to cause the leaf of gold to adhere to it ; lay the tip upon the leaf of gold and carefully transfer it to the work; blow upon it gently and it will straighten out and adhere. It may be rendered quite smooth by slightly dabbing it with a bit of cotton. In about an hour wash off the superfluous gold from the edges, with a sponge and water. If the article is to be exposed to the weather or much wear, the gilding may be varnished with copal varnish. ',\n",
       " 'Burnish-Gilding. — As previously stated, this process requires a specially prepared foundation upon which to ',\n",
       " 'lay the gold, and as the preparation of this foundation is a distinct trade, the furniture dealer or cabinet-maker seldom finds it necessary to undertake it, the articles coming to his hand ready-prepared for gilding; but as in repairing picture-frames, cornices, mirror frames, etc., it frequently becomes necessary to renew the foundation, a comprehensive description of the whole process is given. ',\n",
       " 'Preparing the Wood-work. — After smoothing and dusting the work, coat the frames in every part with boiling-hot parchment-size, as previously described, then mix a sufficient quantity of whiting with size to the consistency of thick cream, and with it by means of a brush, coat every part of the frame several times, permitting each coat to become perfectly dry before proceeding with the next. The wood will thus be covered with a layer of hard whiting nearly or quite a sixteenth of an inch in thickness. The size must not be too thick, and when mixed with the whiting should not be so hot as the preliminary coat of size. ',\n",
       " 'Polishing. — When the prepared frames are quite dry, clean and polish them. To do this, wet a small piece at a time, and, with a smooth, fine piece of cloth, dipped in water, rub the part till all the bumps and inequalities are removed ; and for those parts where the fingers will not enter, as the mouldings, etc., wind the wet cloth round a piece of wood, and by this means make the surface all smooth and even alike. ',\n",
       " 'Where there is carved work, etc., it will sometimes be necessary to bring the mouldings to their original sharpness by means of chisels, gouges, etc., as the preparation will be apt to fill up all the finer parts of the work, which must be thus restored. It is sometimes the practice, after polishing, to go over the work once with fine yellow or Roman ochre; but this is rarely necessary. ',\n",
       " 'Applying the Size. — Select the proper gold size from the receipts previously given ; add parchment size until it will just flow from the brush ; make it quite hot, and apply it to the work with a very soft brush, taking care not to make the first coat too thick ; let it dry and give two or three successive coats, after the last brushing it with a stiff brush to remove any inequalities. The work is then ready for the gold. ',\n",
       " 'Laying the Gold. — The manipulation of the gold-leaf has been described under the heading Oil-Gilding. In the process now being described, the size used (being water-size, which as previously explained is permitted to become hard and dry after being applied) must be moistened to cause the gold-leaf to adhere to it. For this purpose, with a long-haired camel-hair pencil, dipped in water, go over as much of the work as you intend the piece of gold to cover; then lay the gold upon it in the manner previously explained. Be sure that the part to which the gold is applied is sufficiently wet; indeed it must be floating, or the gold will be apt ',\n",
       " 'to crack. Proceed in this manner a little at a time, and do not attempt to cover too much at once, until by experience you are able to handle the gold with freedom. In proceeding with the work, if any flows or cracks appear, immediately apply a portion of gold sufficient to cover them. Sometimes when the gold does not appear to adhere sufficiently tight, it will be necessary to draw a pencil quite filled with water close to the edge of the gold, that the water may run underneath it and soften the size. ',\n",
       " 'Burnishing. — When the work is covered with gold, set it by to dry; there is a particular state or degree of dryness, known only by experience in which the moulding is in a fit state for burnishing ; it will probably be ready to burnish in about eight of ten hours, but it will depend on the warmth of the room or state of the air. ',\n",
       " 'When it is ready, those parts intended to be burnished must be dusted with a soft brush; then wiping the burnisher with a piece of soft wash-leather (quite dry) begin to burnish about an inch or two in length at a time, taking care not to bear too hard, but with a gentle and quick motion, applying the tool until all the parts of the surface are equally bright. ',\n",
       " 'Matting or Dead Gold. — Certain portions only of the work are burnished, according to the fancy, and the facility with which the burnishing-tool can be applied; the remaining parts are now to be deprived of ',\n",
       " 'their metallic lustre, to make a more effective contrast with the burnishing. The parts thus treated are said to be matted or dead-gold. The process is as follows *. ',\n",
       " 'Grind some vermilion or yellow ochre very fine, and mix a very small portion either with the parchment size or with the white of an egg, and with a very soft brush lay it evenly on the parts to be dulled; if well done, it will add greatly to the beauty of the work. Previous to matting, the work must be well cleared of superfluous gold, by means of a soft brush. ',\n",
       " 'Finishing. — In elaborate works it is frequently impossible to lay gold-leaf into all the intricacies of an elaborate design, and the parts thus left bare must be finished by touching up with a small brush charged with shell-gold, or gold-powder, mixed with gum-Arabic to the proper consistency. The following receipt describes the preparation of shell-gold : ',\n",
       " 'Shell Gold. — Take any quantity of leaf-gold and grind it with a small portion of honey, to a fine powder, add a little gum-Arabic and sugar-candy, with a little water, and mix it well together ; let it dry. ',\n",
       " 'Silver She. — Grind pipe-clay fine with a little blacklead and good soap, and add parchment-size as directed for gold-size. ',\n",
       " 'Composition for Frame Ornaments. — The ornaments for gilded mirror-frames, etc., are usually moulded from some plastic substance that is somewhat tougher and more durable than the ordinary gilding founda',\n",
       " 'tion of whiting and size. The proper moulds being prepared they are thoroughly rubbed upon the inside with sweet oil, and the composition firmly pressed in; after removing the mould the cast may be dried by a gentle heat, or while still plastic it can be applied in its proper place and bent into any position. Following are receipts for composition : ',\n",
       " 'Dissolve i lb. of glue in i gallon of water. In another kettle boil together 2 lbs. of resin, 1 gill of Venice turpentine, and 1 pint of linseed oil ; mix altogether in one kettle, and boil and stir till the water has evaporated. Turn the whole into a tub of finely-rolled whiting, and work it till it is of the consistency of dough. ',\n",
       " 'Boil 7 lbs. of best glue in 7 half-pints of water. Melt 3 lbs. of white resin in 3 pints of raw linseed oil. When the above has been well boiled put them into a large vessel and simmer them for half an hour, stirring the mixture and taking care that it does not boil over. The whole must then be turned into a box of whiting rolled and sifted, and mixed till it is of the consistency of dough. ',\n",
       " 'To Manipulate Gold Leaf. — Get a piece of paper, thin enough to show shadow of gold-leaf through, slightly wax.it, lay it on .gold-leaf, the latter will then adhere, and can be easily worked, and will come off clean. The paper should be slightly larger than the gold-leaf, and the fingers passed over the paper to make the gold-leaf adhere. ',\n",
       " 'Bronzing. — This is a process for imitating on metal, plaster, wood, or other material, the peculiar appearance produced by chemical action upon the surface of bronze metal. It is accomplished by spreading over the surface of the material to be ornamented a very thin coating of bronze-powder, which is caused to adhere either by applying it directly upon a coating of any of the sizes mentioned in the foregoing pages, or by mixing with a vehicle, such as gum-Arabic or transparent varnish. The latter is most desirable, as in the other case, being subject to the direct action of the atmosphere, the bronzepowder soon tarnishes. In ornamenting furniture, bronzing is generally employed to represent gilding, a variety of bronze called gold-bronze being used, which affords an excellent imitation but is not very lasting. It is usually applied after the completion of the other finishing processes, the ground work being prepared in the manner described under Oil-Gilding, and the size likewise applied as there described. A small wad of cotton-batting is then dipped in the bronze and passed gently over the sized portions, causing the bronze to adhere. In the other method — that of applying the bronze by means of a vehicle — the preliminaries of whiting the ground and sizing are not necessary, a small quantity of bronze being simply mixed with the vehicle employed to such a degree of fluidity that it will flow easily, and in that condition applied with a fine brush. Many preparations are ',\n",
       " 'used as vehicles, such as transparent varnish thinned with turpentine, gum-Arabic dissolved in water, and gold-size reduced with parchment-size. There are a variety of colors in bronze-powders, and to produce the best effect the size or vehicle should be of a color similar to that of the bronze used; in gold-size the coloring pigment is ochre, and in its place, for greenbronze, red-bronze, or blue-bronze, may be employed respectively verditer, vermilion or Prussian blue, a very small quantity being sufficient. In bronzing on painted work the ground should be as nearly as possible the color of the bronze to be applied. ',\n",
       " 'Glue. — Glue is prepared from waste pieces of skin, horns, hoofs, and other animal offal. These are steeped, washed, boiled, strained, melted, reboiled and cast into square cakes, which are then dried. The strongest kind of glue is made from the hides of oxen ; that from the bones and sinews is weaker. The older the animal the stronger the glue. Good glue should be hard in the cake, of a strong, dark color, almost transparent, free from black or cloudy spots, and with little or no smell. The best sorts are transparent and of a clear amber color. Inferior kinds are sometimes contaminated with the lime used for removing the hair from the skins of which they are made. The best glue swells considerably (the more the better) when immersed in cold water, but does not dissolve, and returns to its former size when dry. Inferior glue made from bones, will, however, dissolve almost entirely in cold water. ',\n",
       " 'To Prepare Glue. — To prepare glue for use it should be broken up into small pieces, and soaked in as much cold water as will cover it, for about twelve hours. It should then be melted in a double glue pot, covered to keep the glue from dirt. Care must be taken to keep the outer vessel full of water, so that the glue shall not burn, or be brought to a temperature higher than that of boiling water. The glue is allowed to simmer for ',\n",
       " 'two or three hours, then gradually melted, so much hot water being added as will make it liquid enough, just to run off a brush in a continuous stream, without breaking into drops. When the glue is done with, some boiling water should be added to make it very thin before it is put away. Freshly-made glue is stronger than that which has been repeatedly melted. Too large a quantity should not therefore be made at a time. Glue may be freed from the foreign animal matter generally in it by softening it in cold water, washing it with the same several times, till it no longer gives out any color, then bruising it with the hand, and suspending it in a linen bag beneath the surface of a large quantity of water at 66° Fahr. By doing this the pure glue is retained in the bag, and the soluble impurities pass through. If the softened glue be heated to 122 without water, and filtered, some other impurities will be retained by the filter, and a colorless solution of glue be obtained. ',\n",
       " 'The addition of a little bichromate of potash will render glue impervious to moisture after exposing to the light, and a small quantity of methylated spirits will greatly improve its keeping qualities. ',\n",
       " 'Mixing Glue. — A minimum amount of glue should be used in good work, and it should be applied as hot as possible. The surfaces of the wood to be united should be clean, dry, and true ; they should be brought together as tightly as possible, so that the superfluous ',\n",
       " 'glue is squeezed out. The cohesion of a piece of solid glue, or the force required to separate one square inch, is four thousand pounds. The strength of common glue for coarse work is increased by the addition of a little powdered chalk. The hotter the glue the greater its cohesion; therefore in all large and long joints the glue should be applied immediately after boiling. Glue loses much of its strength by frequent re-melting ; that glue, therefore, which is newly made, is much preferable to that which has been re-boiled. ',\n",
       " 'Glue Pot. — A glue pot recently perfected consists of a circular kerosene lamp, made of tin, resting upon a tin bottom 8y 2 inches in diameter. The lamp is fitted with a tin chimney in place of glass, and fitted with a small aperture, covered with mica, so as to see how to regulate the flame. The glue pot is made of copper, tinned on the inside and supported upon a rim setting up about six inches from the bottom of the lamp, the rim supported by three legs, soldered and riveted to the rim and bottom of lamp rest. The pot in which the bottom is placed has a portion of the bottom arched, to give more heating surface, and connecting with the chamber under the pot is a flue, passing out and up alongside of the pot, which carries off any smoke from the lamp, and also acts as a draft to the flame. This pot is five inches in diameter, and about six inches high. The pot for the reception of the glue is set in the same as an ordinary glue pot, and will hold about a ',\n",
       " 'quart of glue. The whole can be carried to any place where you wish to use it, and still have the heat kept up. The cost of oil is but a few cents a week. ',\n",
       " 'Another improvement is in the pot being of copper, tinned. It will not corrode and spoil the glue, as is the case with iron. ',\n",
       " 'French cabinet-makers use a glue pot with an inside pan made of glazed earthenware and divided radially into three divisions, in one of which is kept strong glue, in another weaker, and in the third water only, with a brush or piece of sponge for cleaning off superfluous glue from the work. ',\n",
       " 'A few holes bored near the top of the inner vessel of a glue pot by admitting steam from the outer vessel will prevent the glue from solidifying on the side. They need not be bored round the whole circumference of the pot, to allow of pouring out the glue if necessary. ',\n",
       " 'To Prevent Glue Cracking. — Glue frequently cracks because of the dryness of the air in rooms warmed by .stoves. The addition of chloride of calcium to glue will prevent this disagreeable property of cracking. Chloride of calcium is such a deliquescent salt that it attracts enough moisture to prevent the glue from cracking. Glue thus prepared will adhere to glass, metal, etc., and can be used for putting on labels without danger of their dropping off. ',\n",
       " 'Strong Glue to Resist Moisture. — Dissolve gumsandarac and mastic, of each a quarter of an ounce, in ',\n",
       " 'a quarter of a pint of spirits of wine, to which add a\" quarter of an ounce of clear turpentine; now take strong glue, or that in which isinglass has been dissolved; then, putting the gums into a double glue-pot, add by degrees the glue, constantly stirring it over the fire till the whole is well incorporated ; strain it through a cloth, and it is ready for use. You may now return it to the glue pot, and add half an ounce of very finelypowdered glass ; use it quite hot. If you join two pieces, of wood together with it, you may, when perfectly hard and dry, immerse it in water, and the joint will not separate. ',\n",
       " 'Glue to Resist Moisture. — To two quarts of skimmed milk add half a pound of the best glue ; melt them together, taking care they do not boil over, and you will have a very strong glue, which will resist damp or moisture. ',\n",
       " 'Portable Glue. — Boil one pound of the best glue, strain it very clear; boil also four ounces of isinglass; put it into a double glue-pot, with half a pound of fine brown sugar, and boil it pretty thick ; then pour it into plates or moulds. When cold you may cut and dry them for the pocket. ',\n",
       " 'This glue is very useful to draughtsmen, architects* etc., as it immediately dilutes in warm water, and fastens the paper without the process of dampening; or, it may be used by softening it in the mouth/ and applying it to the paper. ',\n",
       " 'How to get fresh air in the glue room during the hot periods of summer, and at the same time not have the disturbing drafts that evaporate thinly-spread glue, is quite a problem. Yet, like many other problems, it is largely a matter of attention to details. . There are various ways of ventilating rooms so as to get fresh air without getting a strong current. The temptation is naturally strong to throw open windows and doors in hot weather, so as to have a breeze, but generally this is the very thing one must guard against. ',\n",
       " 'Some glue rooms that have windows on one side and the other three sides carefully inclosed, may have the windows opened without producing a strong draft, but, even so, it is better to have window screens made of fine, close-meshed wire, something like those used on railway trains to keep out the dust. They will help keep out the dust, keep out the draft, and also keep out insects that are tempted by the odor of the glue to make a visit to the glue room. There are other variations, such as letting down the top windows instead of raising the bottom ones; others in which a box-like arrangement opening upward instead of straight in, is inserted under the window to let in the fresh air and turn it upward instead of across the room. These are mechanical ventilators that can be used for scientifically ventilating a room without producing currents. And ',\n",
       " 'there are, in fact, many ways to get around this draft business, and while their use may deprive the glue room of some of the breeziness that is inviting in summer, still they will furnish fresh air in a manner that is more healthful to those working in it, as well as less damaging to the glue work than strong currents. ',\n",
       " 'To Raise Old Veneers. — First, wash the surface with boiling water, and, with a coarse cloth, remove dirt or grease; then place it before the fire, or heat it with a caul; oil its surface with common linseed-oil, place it again to the fire, and the heat will make the oil penetrate quite through the veneer, and soften the glue underneath ; then, while hot, raise the edge gently with a chisel, and it will separate completely from the ground ; be careful not to use too great force, or the work will be spoiled. Again, if it should get cold during the operation, apply more oil, and heat it again. Repeat this process till the veneer is entirely separated, then wash off the old glue and proceed to lay it again as a new veneer. ',\n",
       " 'To Take Out Bruises in Furniture. — Wet the part with warm water; double a piece of brown paper five or six times, soak it, and lay it on the place ; apply on that a hot flat-iron till the moisture is evaporated. If the bruise be not gone, repeat the process. After two or three applications, the dent or bruise will be raised level with the surface. If the bruise be small, merely soak it with warm water, and apply a red-hot poker very near the surface; keep it continually wet, and in a few minutes the bruise will disappear. ',\n",
       " 'To Make Paste for Laying Cloth or Leather. — To a pint of the best wheaten flour add resin, very finely ',\n",
       " 'powdered, about two large spoonfuls; of alum, one spoonful, in powder; mix them all well together, put them into a pan, and add by degrees soft or rain water, carefully stirring it till it is of the consistence of thinnish cream; put it into a saucepan over a clear fire, keeping it constantly stirred, that it may not get lumpy. When it is of a stiff consistence, so that the spoon will stand upright in it, it is done enough. Be careful to stir it well from the bottom, for it will burn if not well attended to. Empty it out into a pan and cover it over till cold, to prevent a skin forming on the top, which would make it lumpy. ',\n",
       " 'This paste is very superior for the purpose, and adhesive. To use it for cloth or baize, spread the paste evenly and smoothly on the top of the table, and lay the cloth on it, pressing and smoothing it with a flat piece of wood; let it remain till dry; then trim the edges close to the cross-banding. If you cut it close at first, it will, in drying, shrink and look bad where it meets the banding all round. If used for leather, the leather must be first previously damped, and then the paste spread over it; then lay it on the table, and rub it smooth and level with a linen cloth, and cut the edges close to the banding with a short knife. Some lay their table cover with glue instead of paste, and for cloth perhaps it is the best method; but for leather it is not proper, as glue is apt to run through. In using it for cloth, great care must be taken that the glue be ',\n",
       " 'not too thin, and that the cloth be well rubbed down with a thick piece of wood made hot at the fire, for the glue soon chills. By this method, the edges may be cut off close to the border at once. ',\n",
       " 'Cements for Stopping Flaws in Wood. — Put any quantity of fine sawdust of the same wood your work is made with into an earthen pan, and pour boiling water on it, stir it well, and let it remain for a week or ten days, occasionally stirring it; then boil it for some time, and it will be of the consistence of pulp or paste ; put it into a coarse cloth, and squeeze all the moisture from it. Keep for use, and, when wanted, mix a sufficient quantity of thin glue to make it into a paste ; rub it well into the cracks, or fill up the holes in your work with it. When quite hard and dry, clean your work off, and if carefully done, you will scarcely discern the imperfection. ',\n",
       " 'Mahogany-Colored Cement. — Melt two ounces of beeswax and half an ounce of Indian red,, and a small quantity of yellow ochre, to bring the. cement to the desired color ; keep it in a pipkin for use. , ',\n",
       " 'Cement for Turners. — Melt together beeswax, one ounce ; resin, half an ounce ; and pitch, half an ounce ; stir in the mixture some very fine brickdust to give it a body. If too soft, add more resin; if too hard, more wax. When nearly cold, make it up into cakes or rolls, which keep for use. ',\n",
       " 'piece of wood on the chuck, which is done by applying the roller of cement to the chuck and it will adhere with sufficient force. ',\n",
       " 'To Cut Good Steel Scrapers. — Part of the blade of a broken saw makes the best scrapers ; but, as it is hard, it is very difficult to cut it into the required form. The best and most expeditious way is to mark it out to the size wanted, and then to place the blade or steel plate in a vice whose chaps shut very close, placing the mark even with the face of the vise, and the part to be cut to waste above the vise. Then with a cold-chisel, or a common steel-firmer that has its basil broken off, holding it close to the vise and rather inclined upwards, begin at one end of the steel plate, and with a sharp blow of the hammer it will cut it. Keep going on by degrees, and you will with ease cut it to the shape required ; then grind the edges of your scraper level, and finish by rubbing it on your oil stone. ',\n",
       " 'To Clean Oil Paintings. — Wash with a sponge or a soft leather and water, and dry by rubbing with a silk handkerchief. When the picture is very dirty, take it out of its frame, procure a clean towel, and making it quite wet, lay it on the face of the picture, sprinkling it from time to time with clear soft water ; let it remain wet for two or three days ; take the cloth off and renew it with a fresh one; after wiping the picture with a clean wet sponge, repeat the process till all the dirt is soaked out ; then wash it well with a soft sponge, and let ',\n",
       " 'it get dry; rub it with some clear nut or linseed oil. Spirits of wine and turpentine may be used to dissolve the hard old varnish, but they will attack the paint as well as the varnish if the further action of the spirits is not stopped at the proper time by using water freely. ',\n",
       " 'Cleaning Varnished Pictures. — There are conditions where the above simple process will not accomplish what is required ; where a thick coating of varnish has been applied to the picture, and it has been hung in a smoky room, and dust and dirt has been allowed to gather and remain; then it is that no high lights will be visible, the sky will be dirty, no distance visible, and perhaps the figures in the foreground very indistinct. Under these conditions the varnish must be either removed or the smoke and dirt must be brought out of the varnish. If it is thought desirable to try the latter, the following receipt will be found valuable for the purpose: 2 oz. wood naptha, 1 oz. spirits of salts, % pint of linseed-oil. ',\n",
       " 'Mix the above well together, and before using shake the bottle. It can be used as follows : Get some soft linen rag, and make up a soft pad, which place on the mouth of the bottle and shake up some of the mixture into the pad, then commence rubbing the picture with a circular motion, and when nearly dry again give the pad another dressing of mixture, and continue this mode of procedure for some time, when the picture will gradually come out in all its detail. ',\n",
       " \"Cleaning Engravings. — Put the engraving on a smooth board, cover it thinly with common salt finely powdered. Squeeze lemon juice upon the salt so as to dissolve a considerable portion of it; elevate one end of the board so that it may form an angle of about '45 or 50 degrees. Pour on the engraving boiling water from a tea kettle until the salt and lemon juice be all washed off. The engraving then will be perfectly clean and free from stains. It must be dried on the board or some smooth surface gradually. If dried by the fire or the sun it will be tinged with a yellow color. \",\n",
       " 'Cleaning Engravings. — Presuming these to be mounted, proceed in the following manner: Cut a stale loaf in half, with a perfectly clean knife ; pare the crust away from the edges. Now place the engravings on a perfectly flat table, and rubbing the surface with the fresh-cut bread, in circular sweeps, lightly but firmly performed, will remove 1 all superficial markings: Now soak the prints for a short time in a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid,\" say 1 part acid to rocrof water, and then remove them into -a vessel containing a sufficient quantity of clear chloride lime -water to cover them. Leave them there until bleached to the desired point: Now remove, rinse well by allowing to stand an hour in a pan in which a constant stream of water is allowed to flow, and finally dry off by spreading on clean cloths. Perhaps -the sheetsmay -require ironing between two sheets of clean paper; ',\n",
       " 'To Smooth a Damaged Picture. — Paintings sometimes get convex and concave patches on their surface, owing to pressure on one side or the other, and these inequalities cause a great deal of trouble to bring out. The most successful way is to well wet both sides of the picture on the spot, and keep it under pressure till dry. With small pictures the quickest way would be to take them off the stretcher and lay them in a press, with a light pressure between soft sheets of paper. ',\n",
       " 'Embossed Gilding for Illuminating. — Gilding of figures and letters on paper and for the embellishment of manuscripts, is performed with shell gold tempered with gum water; or the characters may be drawn with a milky solutionof gum ammanacum made in water, and ^old leaf applied upon them when almost dry ; they may again be sufficiently moistened for receiving the gold by breathing on them. Letters raised from the surface, if paper or parchment in the manner of embossed work, such as are seen on ancient manuscripts, may be formed either by friction on a proper body with a solid piece of gold, or by leaf gold. ',\n",
       " \"The former method is practiced by tempering pulverizers' crystal with strong gum water, and with this paste forming the letters ; when they are dry, they are rubbed with a piece of solid gold as in polishing, and the letters will appear as if gilt with burnished gold. The letters are formed with an embossed figure, either of the separate letters or of whole words cut in steel, \",\n",
       " 'and each letter of these stamps when they are used, is oiled evenly with a feather. Then fill these concave letters with the above paste, and strike the stamps in a perpendicular direction on the paper or vellum laid on sheets of soft paper. ',\n",
       " 'When the embossed letters are formed with leaf gold, the following or a similar composition must be used. Thicken beaten whites of eggs with as much vermilion as is necessary to give them the consistence of paste ; use the stamps as before, and when the letters are dry moisten them by a small pencil with strong gum water, and when this is almost dry cover the letters with leaf gold, pressing it close to every part of them with cotton wood ; when dry, burnish.

       " 'In preparing this work, I think it unnecessary to waste time and space in publishing a preface, which would at least occupy from three to five pages, and which at best, would be of little service to my readers ; so I will content myself, and perhaps serve my readers better by inserting in these remarks the gist of what would be expected to appear in a preface, along with other material that may be both interesting and useful. ',\n",
       " 'In these days, specialization in \"Furniture-making\" has in a great measure robbed the trade of many of its charms, as well as its claims to the dignified position it once held. ',\n",
       " 'In the \"good old times\" every man who could hold up his head and say truthfully \"I am a CabinetMaker,\" meant that he had given long years of apprenticeship to every branch and every detail of the business. His assertion, when interpreted, meant \"that he could take timber, saw it, plane it, mould it, glue it, veneer it, join it, carve it, finish it, and upholster it, all by hand.\" It meant a full knowledge of everything connected with the manufacture from the entrance to the yard and to that of the wareroom. What might be expected of such workmen, in the way of completeness ',\n",
       " 'and thoroughness, could be had for the hiring. Their experience was indelibly stamped upon their work. ',\n",
       " 'Invention has disarranged this most certainly. The labor-saving machinery of later years has dispensed with something of the old-time necessity. Circular saws, jig and band saws, stickers, planers, jointers, carvers, and the many contrivances, for economizing time, have made those long terms of apprenticeship in a measure, unnecessary, and to-day men are not Cabinet-Makers in the sense we have referred to, but they are competent to do either circular-sawing, band-sawing, moulding, or planing, etc., alone, and but little else. This subdivision of labor has been the outgrowth of the advance of invention. ',\n",
       " 'Often you will have among your applicants for work, men who belong to both classes — representatives of the \"old school\" as it were, and fledgelings who, having rubbed furniture three months in some manufactory, and consider themselves fit subjects for a diploma. It will be found to be advantageous to mix these two elements. Each has claims which are worthy of consideration. The former class, from having been drilled so faithfully in every department of the work; although, workmen of this class are apt to be wedded a little too firmly to the methods in use when they were apprentices. Workmen of the latter kind are progressive, and restless under restraint; perhaps a little too much so sometimes. But the two average well, and the ',\n",
       " 'The bench hands, bear in mind, must be men of experience, with this quality more or less extended as the quality of the work may require. In cases where most of the work is machine work, the manufacturer will readily perceive that he can, with advantage to himself, engage the services of a class of men whose knowledge is confined exclusively to the machine they pledge themselves to run. Migratory workmen are a curse to themselves and the manufacturer. They are the best examples of the saying: \"A rolling stone gathers no moss.\" ',\n",
       " 'The close subdivision of work in our best manufactories is conducive to uniform and generally good results, that is, that the tools and machines produced are of equable quality and uniform in build. ',\n",
       " 'The system that includes the individual workman only as the intelligent part of the machinery is admirable as making him an exact reproducing agent, and consequently aiding in uniform results ; but it is to be questioned whether it is the best plan to make intelligent practical machines. It may be that possible excellence by it will be sacrificed to tolerable uniformity. Good mechanics of fifty-five years ago have little sympathy with a system that lowers the status of mechanical conditions to the level of the machine attendant, or the monotonous worker at a single branch. This system is ',\n",
       " \"not consonant with the freedom of individual endeavour that seems to be a part of the American mechanics' aspirations. \",\n",
       " 'After all the old-time job shop was about as reasonable a school as the embryo mechanic could desire. The foreman of one of the best known establishments in this country recently died. In conversation long ago he stated that his intimate knowledge of the different departments of the work was got from his experience in a \"job shop,\" where he had a chance at everything, from the lathe to the carving room. He made his own drawings (sketches), and frequently made his own designs. These accomplishments may have been crude, but they gave him the idea of how a job should be done, as well as what was to be accomplished. He was an example of one sort of a practical mechanic, of which there should be more. ',\n",
       " 'Since the grand art movement, of which Victor Hugo\\'s \"Notre-Dame de Paris\" was the most brilliant expression, the taste for art objects has gradually developed with an intensity almost incredible. The stuffs, the china-ware, and above all the furniture of preceding centuries, are, now that they are old and battered, always sold for prices far higher, because of their excellence of construction and design. In this tendency it would be wrong to see nothing but a single fashion, a mania and an exaggeration, based upon fantasy and imitation; all the men of taste of one nation, ',\n",
       " 'or, we might well say, of all great nations in the world, could not possibly be deceived to this extent, and with this unanimity of their fantasy, had it not a solid and serious basis. And this fashion for antique furniture does not rest upon a very reasonable and very logical foundation, — at first in its disdain for phantom furniture, which, through the perfecting of wood-working machines, has arrived at the last degrees of veneer, scarcely presenting the slightest degree of solidity, the mahogany, oak, walnut, and rose-wood with which they are coated cracking at the slightest shock, and peeling off at the least change in the dampness or dryness of the weather. All the world, too, knows equally well that the homely furniture of thirty years ago, Queen Anne and Eastlake, is equally inelegant in appearance, and uncomfortable in use. There is, then, in the desire of purchasing antique furniture, the just idea of procuring articles altogether solidly built, the form of which is always, if not absolutely conformable to the rules of art, at least entirely different from the veneer articles which, from their nature, can only be subject to very limited number of combinations, and can never furnish to the taste of architects and designers the same resources as solid wood. A longing to escape from the cold and monotonous furniture of the preceding generation added to the renaissance movement of the year of 1800, caused a greedy demand for antique furniture to suddenly arise ; but when all of those arti',\n",
       " 'cles which had remained sound and solid were sold off, it was necessary to repair, restore, and strengthen those articles which were only discovered in fragments. ',\n",
       " 'While the introduction of machinery had had much to do with changing the character and working methods of the cabinet maker, it has proved a great boon to humanity generally, and has given to the masses, a class of furniture they never could have enjoyed but for the cheaper productions by the aid of power, and machines, and in these remarks, I do not wish to give the impression that machine made furniture is not good, or that it has not a beauty of its own, or that a majority of the designs are not graceful and well adapted to the days in which it was executed. In fact, I am of the belief that woodworking machinery has proved a blessing to both producer and user of cabinet work, while at the same time it has proved almost fatal to the distinctive and individual beauty of artistic handmade furniture. ',\n",
       " 'The object of the writer of this book, is to aid the young cabinet-maker — and the old one too — in obtaining a knowledge of the art from A to Z, and to enable him to take his material from the rough, and work it up until it reaches a finished state ready to take the place for which it was intended. I also purpose reproducing a number of designs of, what was generally considered to be some of the finest examples of furniture, from which the young workman and designer, may absorb inspiration and give to his work a charm ',\n",
       " 'and character to such work as he may undertake to execute, that can never be conveyed to articles made by the machine. ',\n",
       " \"It may be said, and with justice, that there is little or no demand for handmade art furniture, but I am persuaded this condition is occasioned because of the little of it there is jn the market, and the very high prices demanded for it by the owners. These high prices are placed on the articles, not by the maker, designer or workman, but by dealers, and the prices are often from four to five times the actual cost of the original work, and are only bought by rich people, whereas, if the prices were normal, the middle classes, whos'e taste is equal — and often superior — to that of the very rich, would indulge in handmade work to a very much larger extent than they now do. \",\n",
       " 'The bright sharp workman, of whom there are hundreds in our cabinet factories, who have been trained from the lumber yards to the running of the most delicate machinery in the shop, who by a little study, and a little practical work, may soon become able to make and finish furniture — by hand — of the finest sort, furniture too, that will find a ready market if the maker does his best. Many fine pieces of furniture have been made by advanced students after work-hours or during holidays. I have in mind at this writing, a splendid oak side-board, that was made in Newark, N. J., by a young man who was serving some years in a furniture ',\n",
       " \"shop, in that city, as an apprentice. The work was all done by hand, and in a shed in the rear of the house, polishing and all. The sideboard was intended for his father, but a wealthy neighbor of the latter, a man of taste, seeing the work before it was quite completed, offered to buy it, and thus, when finished was sold for the sum of $280.00. The materials, including mirrors, stained and leaded glass, hardware, and other stuff, all told, cost about $55.00. When it is considered, the work was done, nearly all after hours, between the fifteenth of October and the end of April, the amount was quite a comfortable addition to the young man's slender yearly salary. But the money gained, was but a fraction of the benefit he derived, as the experience, and the knowledge obtained in making the furniture, were worth to him many times the money he received for it. \",\n",
       " 'Of course, I do not think every apprentice, or even a large percentage of them, could make such pieces of furniture, or find purchasers for them after they were made, but every apprentice or student could make something, that would be useful and ornamental, and have a cash value, besides opening a way for the cultivation of a broader and more exact artistic taste. ',\n",
       " 'Taste was the founder of all our styles in furniture from the prehistoric log stool all the way down through the Egyptian, Babylonian, Chinese, Greek, Roman, Medieval, Byzantine, French, Gothic and the more ',\n",
       " 'modern styles of Chipendale, Shereton, Adams, and our colonial styles, and it is essential that every cabinetmaker who aspires to know his business, should cultivate taste, make himself conversant with the various styles, and be able at a glance to tell to what style, or on what lines any given piece of furniture is intended to represent. ',\n",
       " 'In this connection, I may say, it is proposed to lay before my readers a chapter or two on the various styles of furniture, with illustrations, explanations and some details. It is also intended to offer some instructions for performing such work as gilding, staining, polishing, and finishing the work complete. ',\n",
       " \"There are but a few books of value, on the art of cabinet-making, available to the American reader, though in French, and German, and even in Italian, there are quite a number, but most of their renderings would be of little use to the English or American workman, however, I will try and cull from them, whatever I deem suitable to these pages. The cullings from these works will consist mostly of illustrations, representing some of the best works of French, Italian, and German masters, with such explanations as may be necessary. The only American work, of a real practical nature, that I have any knowledge of is, first, Cabinet-maker's Companion, by J. Stokes, published by Henry Carey Baird, Philadelphia, Pa., 1870. This is an excellent little work and contains quite a number of good re\",\n",
       " 'ceipts on dyeing, staining, and other useful matter. Another book, a still more modern one by Alvan Crocker Nye, Ph. B. and deals nearly altogether with the constructional principle of cabinet-making, but it has little to say regarding the styles or historical peculiarities of furniture. This book is published by Wm. Comstock, New York, and is dated 1900. Some other Manuals are very good in their way, but they are written chiefly for boys who have had little or no experience in woodworking, and who may not intend making Cabinet-making a life work, are suited more for amateur workers rather than for those intending to follow woodworking for a living. These manuals however, will prove useful to every one who intends to work in wood, either professionally or a,s an amateur. ',\n",
       " 'There have been many essays on the art of furniture making, in our journals and art magazines, but these have generally been of an academic character, with a few exceptions, and have proved but of little service to the practical workman. ',\n",
       " 'A brief history of furniture and its growth, may not be out of place, though I do not purpose going into the subject at great length, so I will devote one illustrated chapter only to it. ',\n",
       " 'The first well-known reference to woodwork is to be found in the Book of Genesis in the instructions given to Noah to make an Ark of \"Gopher Wood,\" to make a window, to pitch it within and without with pitch, and to observe definite measurements. From the specific directions thus handed down to us we may gather that mankind had acquired at a very early period of the World\\'s history a knowledge of the different kinds of wood, and the use of the various tools. ',\n",
       " \"We know also, from the various bas-reliefs and papyri to be found in the World's museums, how advanced were the Old Egyptians in the arts of civilization, and that the manufacture of comfortable and even luxurious furniture was well known. It is quite evident the Hebrews must have had the best of workmen for their teachers and taskmasters to have enabled them to acquire sufficient skill and experience to carry out such precise instructions as were given for the building of the ark, and the erection of the Tabernacle, the latter of which was built some 1 500 years before Christ — as to the kinds of wood, measurements, ornaments, fastenings (loops and taches), curtains of linen, and coverings of dried skins. We have only to turn for \",\n",
       " 'a moment to the 25th chapter of Exodus to be convinced that all the directions there mentioned were given to a people who had considerable experience in the methods of carrying out work, which must have resulted from some generations of cabinet-makers, carpenters, joiners, weavers, dyers, goldsmiths, and other craftsmen. ',\n",
       " 'A thousand years before Christ, we have those descriptions of the building and fitting by Solomon of the glorious work of his reign, the great temple, and of his own, \"the King\\'s house,\" which gathered from different countries the most skilful artificers of the time, an event which marks an era of advance in \\'the knowledge and skill of those who were thus brought together to do their best work towards carrying out the grand scheme. It is worth while, too, when we are referring to Old Testament information bearing upon the subject, to notice some details of furniture which are given, with their approximate dates as generally accepted, not because there is any particular importance attached to the precise chronology of the events concerned but because, speaking generally, they form landmarks in the history of furniture. One of these is the verse (2 Kings chap, lv) which tells us the contents of the \"little chamber in the wall,\" when Elisha visited the Shunamite, about B. C. 895; and we are told of the preparations for the reception of the prophet: \"And let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool ',\n",
       " 'and a candlestick.\" Another incident is some 420 years later, when, in the allusion to the grandeur of the Palace of Ahasuerus, we catch a glimpse of Eastern magnificence in the description of the drapery which furnished the apartment: \"Where were white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple, to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble.\" (Esther 1:6). ',\n",
       " 'There are, unfortunately, no trustworthy descriptions of ancient Hebrew furniture. The illustrations in Kitto\\'s Bible, Mr. Henry Soltau\\'s \"The Tabernacle, The Priesthood and the Offerings,\" and other similar books, are apparently drawn from imagination, founded on descriptions in the Old Testament. In these, the \"table for shew-bread\" is generally represented as having legs partly turned, with the upper portions square, to which rings were attached for the poles by which it was carried. As a nomadic people, their furniture would be but primitive, and we may take it that as the Jews and Assyrians came from the same stock, and spoke the same language, such ornamental furniture as there was would, with the exception of the representations of figures of men or of animals, be of a similar character. At least this is what Litchfield says, and he is no mean authority. ',\n",
       " 'Doubtless prehistoric men made use of stones, logs, or piled-up sods, for seats, and for spots to rest their ',\n",
       " 'heads ; the use of stones for pillows being quite common as late as early historic times. Be this as it may however, we find, the Egyptians had chairs, beds, tables and other furniture, some of which was highly wrought and ornamented, at least 4000 years before Christ, as shown by the monuments, and by the papyri that have come down to us. We also possess some fragments of bronze furniture of both Egyptian and Assyrian make. ',\n",
       " 'The British Museum and the Louvre contain a few Egyptian chairs or seats that have been made in ebony and ivory, which owe their preservation to the lasting nature of the material. ',\n",
       " \"Two Egyptian chairs or thrones are illustrated at Figs. 1 and 2, in the first part of this work. At Fig. 3, cabinet-makers are represented as occupied in chair making, the feet and legs of the chairs being designed from animals' limbs, and the stools on which the workmen are sitting are blocks of wood hollowed out at the top. The Egyptian couch was of a straight-lined design in the body with a curved head like an ordinary sofa, the legs, feet and other salient points being carved with heads, feet and tails of animals. \",\n",
       " 'Some boxes and coffers with gable tops dovetailed together, small toilet boxes having carved or painted decoration, and Mummy cases of cedar-wood having elaborate hieroglyphic decorations, may be seen in the British Museum and in the Louvre. Chariot and horse furniture are well represented in the reliefs and wall ',\n",
       " 'paintings. Egypt was famed for chariot building, and exported them in trade to the surrounding nations. We read that King Solomon imported his war-chariots from Egypt. ',\n",
       " 'If examples of Egyptian furniture are scarce, the furniture of Assyria is practically non-existent, as the climate of the latter country was not so dry or preservative as that of Egypt, so that all examples thathave not been wilfully destroyed have long ago perished. Many ornaments of bronze and of ivory decorations have been discovered that have been used as mountings to feet, ends of legs of seats, chairs, or thrones. The ',\n",
       " 'bas-reliefs of the latter enables us to form a fairly accurate judgment of the nature and style of Assyrian furniture, the decoration of which was of a heavier and coarser character than that of the more elegant Egyptian ( Fig. 4 and 5 ) . Forms and parts of animals ',\n",
       " 'were used by the Assyrians and nearly all Oriental nations as furniture decorations. The human figure was also used, but generally in the representation of slaves or conquered peoples, who were degraded to the position of bearing the weight of the seat or throne of the monarch. The Egyptian chairs had also carved human figures as captives tied under the seat. ',\n",
       " \"The furniture of the Hebrews was doubtless of the same kind as the Assyrian. From the description of King Solomon's throne it was apparently similar to those of the Assyrian kings. It had lions for the arm supports, and had six lions in gold and ivory on the six steps on either side of the throne. \",\n",
       " 'In the manufacture of the furniture of the nations of antiquity the principal materials were — in woods, ebony, rosewood, walnut, pine, teak, and, above all, cedarwood; ivory, gold, silver, bronze, and electrum were also much used for inlays and for solid mountings. ',\n",
       " 'The furniture and the chariots of the Greeks in their early period were simply copied from Egyptian and Asiatic sources, with less of the animal forms and more of plant forms as decorative details (Figs. 6, 7). Folding stools and chairs were made in wood and in metal and the backs of the chairs Fl ^ re 4 were upright, or nearly so ',\n",

The Greek cistae were cylindrical metal boxes that rested on feet designed from those of various animals, having a lid or cover, with a handle or knot usually of figure design, the whole surface of the body being covered with engraved figure compositions and ornamental borders.

They had couches of wood with one end raised and receding in a graceful curve, with feet fashioned to resemble those of some wild animal. It is supposed that those couches had a rich covering by day and bedding by night. The use of wooden pillows was customary ; they were made of various materials, according to the rank of the possessor, and had a singular kind of cavity in which the head or the back of the neck might rest. Wicker bedsteads were sometimes made of palmbranches, forming a light kind of grating on which the bed and bedding were placed. The tables used were of various forms — round, square and ob',\n",

The chairs of the early times might in many cases be readily mistaken for those now in use among ourselves; whereas the divans and cushions of modern Egypt, on which the natives indolently recline, belong to the oriental system of furniture. In Cairo no chambers are furnished as bed-rooms. The bed, in the day-time, is rolled up and placed on one side, or in an adjoining closet, which is a sleeping-place in the winter. In summer many persons sleep upon the house-tops. The furniture of a room is comprised pretty nearly by the mat or carpet spread upon the floor, and the divans or cushioned couches.

The giltbronze chair of Dagobert is of Romanesque design, and is one of the earliest pieces of furniture of the Middle Ages (see Fig. 19). Another mediaeval chair or throne is high seated, and exceedingly rich in design (Fig. 20). It is of Scandinavian origin, and is a good example of the Romanesque style of Northern Europe.

Consequently, we find in many articles, such as armoires or presses, and cabinets, a mixture of style in the design — as, for instance, the upper panels would be in the Mediaeval, and the lower ones in the Renaissance style, or the general construction would be Gothic, and the details and decoration would be Italian.

       " 'In the \"Quattrocento\" period (1400-1500), or fifteenth century, Italian furniture made for churches, palaces, or private houses, was usually decorated with paintings, sometimes on a gilt ground, which was prepared in a gesso material before the gold was applied, some parts of which had relief ornamentation.

It is inlaid work of a geometric character in design, or is composed of floral ornament, and sometimes consists of representations of landscapes and buildings. This kind of inlay derived from Persian sources, was developed chiefly by the Venetians, and was used mostly by them in the decoration of their stalls, tables, chairs, cabinets, &c. Ebony, ivory, and metals were also employed in the Italian inlays of this period. ',\n",

Some of these artists and their works have been noticed in the chapters on Renaissance architecture and metal work. The cabinet (Fig. 37) is a good example of the architecturic style of French furniture of the sixteenth century. French wood carving is distinguished from the ',\n",

       " 'When the Renaissance had taken a firm root in Germany, the designers and carvers of altar-pieces and of furniture generally proved themselves thorough masters of the style, and were especially skilful in the carving of wood, both on a gigantic and on a minute scale. Whole fronts of houses were elaborately carved in designs consisting of figure work, animals, ornament, and grotesques of a quaint and humorous description, while exceedingly minute works of figure subjects and animals were carved in box and other woods with a delicacy and quaintness often excelling the ivory carvings of the Japanese. Escritoires, buffets, cabinets, and other furniture, were made and exported from Germany into Spain and other countries. ',\n",
       " 'Flemish and English furniture and carving were pretty much alike in the reigns of Elizabeth — the Tudor period of English art — and of James L, the Stuart of Jacobean. The pieces of carved furniture, both Flemish and English, were very solid and heavy both in the design and thickness of material, which was generally of oak or chestnut. So much Flemish furniture was imported into England at this time, and the Englishmade work, being so close in resemblance to the former, that a great difficulty is experienced in classifying examples of this period. The table, Fig. 39, and the socalled \"Great Bed of Ware,\" are examples of the furniture of the Elizabethan period (Fig. 40). ',\n",
       " 'duced in the first instance by the great importations from Italy and Germany, but under such excellent native carvers and designers as Felipe de Borgona (six',\n",
       " 'teenth century), and Berruguete (i 480-1 561), the style of the Renaissance soon spread from Toledo to Seville and Valladolid, where great quantities of carved and inlaid work and elaborate altar-pieces were executed during the prosperous Spanish period of the sixteenth century. ',\n",
       " 'During the same century Venice and Florence were famed for their marquetry — inlaid work of ivory and metal — in cypres s, walnut, and other woods, which art ',\n",
       " 'had been imported from Persia and India by the Venetians, and which spread rapidly through Europe until the furniture made with marquetry decoration by degrees supplanted the heavier classical architectural designs. ',\n",
       " 'Before leaving the Italian sixteenth-century work we must notice the mirrors, with their elaborately carved frames of Venetian design and manufacture. In this century Venice was renowned for the making of glass, for which it is still famous, and certain privileges were granted by the State exclusively to Venetian manufacturers of looking-glasses. Two Murano glass makers named Andrea and Dominico, who were the inventors, were granted in the year 1507 the sole privilege of making \"mirrors of crystal glass\" for a term of twenty years. Previous to this time the mirrors ',\n",
       " 'were made of various polished metals. The frames of the Venetian mirrors were often elaborately carved (Fig. 41), some of them being made in designs that were strictly architectural in character, representing a door, or window frame, with pilasters frieze, and cornice and sill or plinth. These carved frames were often part or wholly gilt, and were exported in considerable quantities. Pictures were framed in a similar way to the mirrors, and carved and gilt frames were soon used all over Europe as picture frames. Later on gilt furniture of all kinds was made in Venice and was in great favor in the other countries of the Continent. ',\n",
       " 'The manufacture of marquetry furniture by the Dutch in the seventeenth century has been mentioned as having helped in a great measure to change the style of furniture design from its former architectural character to a greater simplicity of construction. Large panel surfaces were used for the purpose of showing to greater advantage the rich and bright colors of different kinds of hard woods used in the marquetry. Both natural and stained varieties of various wood were arranged in the designs in juxta-position, and a free and picturesque kind of ornamental foliage was employed mixed with large tulips, roses, and birds in the Dutch marquetry decoration. Other materials such as ivory, ebony, and mother-of-pearl, were also used as inlays. In France a similar kind of marquetry ',\n",
       " 'was developed, but the design consisted more of figure subjects and imitations of ruins in landscapes. A complete change in the design of the furniture in the latter country was also effected by the same desire to get large surface on which the inlaid work could be seen to great advantage, and the spaces were not divided by architectural mouldings, and the pilasters, as they had been in the preceding earlier work. Towards the end of the sixteenth century, and during the earlier half of the seventeenth, the sumptuous furniture, the beds, and general furnishing of the better class of houses and palaces in France and other European countries, were characterized by the use of costly silk brocades, tissues, and embroidered coverings and hangings. ',\n",
       " 'By thus seeking to give the furniture an appearance of the richest possible kind, such articles as chairs, couches, and beds lost in a corresponding degree their elegance and former constructive beauty.

       " 'Quatorze period is that of Andre-Charles Boulle, whose work is known under his name as \"Boulle.\" This celebrated furniture is an elaborate kind of marquetry of which the materials are rare woods, ebony, tortoiseshell, brass, mother-of-pearl, and white metal or tin. The mountings, mouldings, and other salient points are made in brass beautifully chased and finished, some of the mouldings being in the forms of masks, foliages, cartouches, and animals\\' heads and feet as termination. Andre-Charles Boulle was born in Paris in the year ',\n",
       " \"1642. His father, Pierre Boulle was also a distinguished ebeniste, or cabinet-maker, but his more eminent son possessed the artistic gift in a much higher degree. In addition to making his special marquetry from his own designs Boulle also executed a good deal of his best works from the design of Jean Berain ( 1636171 1 ), his chief collaborateur. Berain's designs were more Italian in style, more symmetrical in the composition of the ornament, and more correct from an architectural point of view, than those attributed to Boulle himself, whose designs had much of the looseness and freedom of the prevalent Louis Ouatorze. \",\n",
       " \"At the death of Jean Mace, the king's ebeniste, in 1672, who had formerly lived in the royal galleries of the Louvre, the logement and office of ebeniste to the king had become vacant, and Boulle on the recommendation of Colbert, minister to Louis XIV., was appointed as the successor of Mace, and was installed in his rooms in the Louvre in the year 1673. He na< ^ previously executed some important work for the king, and was known as the ablest ebeniste at that time in Paris. \",\n",
       " 'The origin of the Boulle marquetry can be traced to the Indian, Persian, and Damascus encrusted inlays in ivory, ebony, and metal, that found their way to Venice, Portugal, Spain, and France in the Middle Ages. These works consisted chiefly of caskets, coffers, and small pieces of furniture In the inventories of ',\n",
       " 'Charles V. of France (1380) mention is made of lecterns and coffers of inlaid ivory or bone, in ebony, and similar works are mentioned in the inventories of Charles VI. (1418), and of Anne of Brittany (1498). These are the earliest notices of marquetry furniture that was made in France, and was probably an imitation of Oriental work. ',\n",
       " \"In the Renaissance period Francois I. bought some magnificent furniture of Indian workmanship, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, from Portuguese merchants, and mention is made of chairs, tables, coffers, cabinets, and mirror-frames that belonged to Queen Marie de Medicis (1600), the Cardinal d'Amboise (1500), and other great persons of the French Court, all of which works were made in marquetry. \",\n",
       " 'In France before the sixteenth century, tortoiseshell, brass, tin, and exotic woods were used as inlays, in addition to the ivory, ebony, and nacre of the East. From this it will be seen that Boulle did not invent the celebrated marquetry that bears his name. He, however, brought this sumptuous form of cabinet work to great perfection, and under the patronage of Louis XIV. he had every opportunity to develop his artistic abilities to the utmost. ',\n",
       " 'The method of procedure in the making of the Boulle marquetry was, first, to prepare the veneers of wood, shell, tin, and brass of the same thickness, each having perfectly plain surfaces; these veneers were ',\n",
       " 'then glued together in pairs of opposite materials, according to the nature of the effect required in the ',\n",
       " 'finished work, and were held together firmly in a vice. The design was then traced on the surface of the upper leaf, and the veneers were then cut through the lines of ',\n",

His assertion, when interpreted, meant \"that he could take timber, saw it, plane it, mould it, glue it, veneer it, join it, carve it, finish it, and upholster it, all by hand.\" It meant a full knowledge of everything connected with the manufacture from the entrance to the yard and to that of the wareroom. What might be expected of such workmen, in the way of completeness -and thoroughness, could be had for the hiring. Their experience was indelibly stamped upon their work. -Invention has disarranged this most certainly. The labor-saving machinery of later years has dispensed with something of the old-time necessity. Circular saws, jig and band saws, stickers, planers, jointers, carvers, and the many contrivances, for economizing time, have made those long terms of apprenticeship in a measure, unnecessary, and to-day men are not Cabinet-Makers in the sense we have referred to, but they are competent to do either circular-sawing, band-sawing, moulding, or planing, etc., alone, and but little else. This subdivision of labor has been the outgrowth of the advance of invention. -Often you will have among your applicants for work, men who belong to both classes — representatives of the \"old school\" as it were, and fledgelings who, having rubbed furniture three months in some manufactory, and consider themselves fit subjects for a diploma. It will be found to be advantageous to mix these two elements. Each has claims which are worthy of consideration. The former class, from having been drilled so faithfully in every department of the work; although, workmen of this class are apt to be wedded a little too firmly to the methods in use when they were apprentices. Workmen of the latter kind are progressive, and restless under restraint; perhaps a little too much so sometimes. But the two average well, and the -The bench hands, bear in mind, must be men of experience, with this quality more or less extended as the quality of the work may require. In cases where most of the work is machine work, the manufacturer will readily perceive that he can, with advantage to himself, engage the services of a class of men whose knowledge is confined exclusively to the machine they pledge themselves to run. Migratory workmen are a curse to themselves and the manufacturer. They are the best examples of the saying: \"A rolling stone gathers no moss.\" -The close subdivision of work in our best manufactories is conducive to uniform and generally good results, that is, that the tools and machines produced are of equable quality and uniform in build. -The system that includes the individual workman only as the intelligent part of the machinery is admirable as making him an exact reproducing agent, and consequently aiding in uniform results ; but it is to be questioned whether it is the best plan to make intelligent practical machines. It may be that possible excellence by it will be sacrificed to tolerable uniformity. Good mechanics of fifty-five years ago have little sympathy with a system that lowers the status of mechanical conditions to the level of the machine attendant, or the monotonous worker at a single branch. This system is -not consonant with the freedom of individual endeavour that seems to be a part of the American mechanics\\' aspirations. -After all the old-time job shop was about as reasonable a school as the embryo mechanic could desire. The foreman of one of the best known establishments in this country recently died. In conversation long ago he stated that his intimate knowledge of the different departments of the work was got from his experience in a \"job shop,\" where he had a chance at everything, from the lathe to the carving room. He made his own drawings (sketches), and frequently made his own designs. These accomplishments may have been crude, but they gave him the idea of how a job should be done, as well as what was to be accomplished. He was an example of one sort of a practical mechanic, of which there should be more. -Since the grand art movement, of which Victor Hugo\\'s \"Notre-Dame de Paris\" was the most brilliant expression, the taste for art objects has gradually developed with an intensity almost incredible. The stuffs, the china-ware, and above all the furniture of preceding centuries, are, now that they are old and battered, always sold for prices far higher, because of their excellence of construction and design. In this tendency it would be wrong to see nothing but a single fashion, a mania and an exaggeration, based upon fantasy and imitation; all the men of taste of one nation, -or, we might well say, of all great nations in the world, could not possibly be deceived to this extent, and with this unanimity of their fantasy, had it not a solid and serious basis. And this fashion for antique furniture does not rest upon a very reasonable and very logical foundation, — at first in its disdain for phantom furniture, which, through the perfecting of wood-working machines, has arrived at the last degrees of veneer, scarcely presenting the slightest degree of solidity, the mahogany, oak, walnut, and rose-wood with which they are coated cracking at the slightest shock, and peeling off at the least change in the dampness or dryness of the weather. All the world, too, knows equally well that the homely furniture of thirty years ago, Queen Anne and Eastlake, is equally inelegant in appearance, and uncomfortable in use. There is, then, in the desire of purchasing antique furniture, the just idea of procuring articles altogether solidly built, the form of which is always, if not absolutely conformable to the rules of art, at least entirely different from the veneer articles which, from their nature, can only be subject to very limited number of combinations, and can never furnish to the taste of architects and designers the same resources as solid wood. A longing to escape from the cold and monotonous furniture of the preceding generation added to the renaissance movement of the year of 1800, caused a greedy demand for antique furniture to suddenly arise ; but when all of those arti-cles which had remained sound and solid were sold off, it was necessary to repair, restore, and strengthen those articles which were only discovered in fragments. -While the introduction of machinery had had much to do with changing the character and working methods of the cabinet maker, it has proved a great boon to humanity generally, and has given to the masses, a class of furniture they never could have enjoyed but for the cheaper productions by the aid of power, and machines, and in these remarks, I do not wish to give the impression that machine made furniture is not good, or that it has not a beauty of its own, or that a majority of the designs are not graceful and well adapted to the days in which it was executed. In fact, I am of the belief that woodworking machinery has proved a blessing to both producer and user of cabinet work, while at the same time it has proved almost fatal to the distinctive and individual beauty of artistic handmade furniture. -The object of the writer of this book, is to aid the young cabinet-maker — and the old one too — in obtaining a knowledge of the art from A to Z, and to enable him to take his material from the rough, and work it up until it reaches a finished state ready to take the place for which it was intended. I also purpose reproducing a number of designs of, what was generally considered to be some of the finest examples of furniture, from which the young workman and designer, may absorb inspiration and give to his work a charm -and character to such work as he may undertake to execute, that can never be conveyed to articles made by the machine. -It may be said, and with justice, that there is little or no demand for handmade art furniture, but I am persuaded this condition is occasioned because of the little of it there is jn the market, and the very high prices demanded for it by the owners. These high prices are placed on the articles, not by the maker, designer or workman, but by dealers, and the prices are often from four to five times the actual cost of the original work, and are only bought by rich people, whereas, if the prices were normal, the middle classes, whos\\'e taste is equal — and often superior — to that of the very rich, would indulge in handmade work to a very much larger extent than they now do. -The bright sharp workman, of whom there are hundreds in our cabinet factories, who have been trained from the lumber yards to the running of the most delicate machinery in the shop, who by a little study, and a little practical work, may soon become able to make and finish furniture — by hand — of the finest sort, furniture too, that will find a ready market if the maker does his best. Many fine pieces of furniture have been made by advanced students after work-hours or during holidays. I have in mind at this writing, a splendid oak side-board, that was made in Newark, N. J., by a young man who was serving some years in a furniture -shop, in that city, as an apprentice. The work was all done by hand, and in a shed in the rear of the house, polishing and all. The sideboard was intended for his father, but a wealthy neighbor of the latter, a man of taste, seeing the work before it was quite completed, offered to buy it, and thus, when finished was sold for the sum of $280.00. The materials, including mirrors, stained and leaded glass, hardware, and other stuff, all told, cost about $55.00. When it is considered, the work was done, nearly all after hours, between the fifteenth of October and the end of April, the amount was quite a comfortable addition to the young man\\'s slender yearly salary. But the money gained, was but a fraction of the benefit he derived, as the experience, and the knowledge obtained in making the furniture, were worth to him many times the money he received for it. -Of course, I do not think every apprentice, or even a large percentage of them, could make such pieces of furniture, or find purchasers for them after they were made, but every apprentice or student could make something, that would be useful and ornamental, and have a cash value, besides opening a way for the cultivation of a broader and more exact artistic taste. -Taste was the founder of all our styles in furniture from the prehistoric log stool all the way down through the Egyptian, Babylonian, Chinese, Greek, Roman, Medieval, Byzantine, French, Gothic and the more -modern styles of Chipendale, Shereton, Adams, and our colonial styles, and it is essential that every cabinetmaker who aspires to know his business, should cultivate taste, make himself conversant with the various styles, and be able at a glance to tell to what style, or on what lines any given piece of furniture is intended to represent. -In this connection, I may say, it is proposed to lay before my readers a chapter or two on the various styles of furniture, with illustrations, explanations and some details. It is also intended to offer some instructions for performing such work as gilding, staining, polishing, and finishing the work complete. -There are but a few books of value, on the art of cabinet-making, available to the American reader, though in French, and German, and even in Italian, there are quite a number, but most of their renderings would be of little use to the English or American workman, however, I will try and cull from them, whatever I deem suitable to these pages. The cullings from these works will consist mostly of illustrations, representing some of the best works of French, Italian, and German masters, with such explanations as may be necessary. The only American work, of a real practical nature, that I have any knowledge of is, first, Cabinet-maker\\'s Companion, by J. Stokes, published by Henry Carey Baird, Philadelphia, Pa., 1870. This is an excellent little work and contains quite a number of good re-ceipts on dyeing, staining, and other useful matter. Another book, a still more modern one by Alvan Crocker Nye, Ph. B. and deals nearly altogether with the constructional principle of cabinet-making, but it has little to say regarding the styles or historical peculiarities of furniture. This book is published by Wm. Comstock, New York, and is dated 1900. Some other Manuals are very good in their way, but they are written chiefly for boys who have had little or no experience in woodworking, and who may not intend making Cabinet-making a life work, are suited more for amateur workers rather than for those intending to follow woodworking for a living. These manuals however, will prove useful to every one who intends to work in wood, either professionally or a,s an amateur. -There have been many essays on the art of furniture making, in our journals and art magazines, but these have generally been of an academic character, with a few exceptions, and have proved but of little service to the practical workman. -A brief history of furniture and its growth, may not be out of place, though I do not purpose going into the subject at great length, so I will devote one illustrated chapter only to it. -The first well-known reference to woodwork is to be found in the Book of Genesis in the instructions given to Noah to make an Ark of \"Gopher Wood,\" to make a window, to pitch it within and without with pitch, and to observe definite measurements. From the specific directions thus handed down to us we may gather that mankind had acquired at a very early period of the World\\'s history a knowledge of the different kinds of wood, and the use of the various tools. -We know also, from the various bas-reliefs and papyri to be found in the World\\'s museums, how advanced were the Old Egyptians in the arts of civilization, and that the manufacture of comfortable and even luxurious furniture was well known. It is quite evident the Hebrews must have had the best of workmen for their teachers and taskmasters to have enabled them to acquire sufficient skill and experience to carry out such precise instructions as were given for the building of the ark, and the erection of the Tabernacle, the latter of which was built some 1 500 years before Christ — as to the kinds of wood, measurements, ornaments, fastenings (loops and taches), curtains of linen, and coverings of dried skins. We have only to turn for -a moment to the 25th chapter of Exodus to be convinced that all the directions there mentioned were given to a people who had considerable experience in the methods of carrying out work, which must have resulted from some generations of cabinet-makers, carpenters, joiners, weavers, dyers, goldsmiths, and other craftsmen. -A thousand years before Christ, we have those descriptions of the building and fitting by Solomon of the glorious work of his reign, the great temple, and of his own, \"the King\\'s house,\" which gathered from different countries the most skilful artificers of the time, an event which marks an era of advance in \\'the knowledge and skill of those who were thus brought together to do their best work towards carrying out the grand scheme. It is worth while, too, when we are referring to Old Testament information bearing upon the subject, to notice some details of furniture which are given, with their approximate dates as generally accepted, not because there is any particular importance attached to the precise chronology of the events concerned but because, speaking generally, they form landmarks in the history of furniture. One of these is the verse (2 Kings chap, lv) which tells us the contents of the \"little chamber in the wall,\" when Elisha visited the Shunamite, about B. C. 895; and we are told of the preparations for the reception of the prophet: \"And let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool -and a candlestick.\" Another incident is some 420 years later, when, in the allusion to the grandeur of the Palace of Ahasuerus, we catch a glimpse of Eastern magnificence in the description of the drapery which furnished the apartment: \"Where were white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple, to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble.\" (Esther 1:6). -There are, unfortunately, no trustworthy descriptions of ancient Hebrew furniture. The illustrations in Kitto\\'s Bible, Mr. Henry Soltau\\'s \"The Tabernacle, The Priesthood and the Offerings,\" and other similar books, are apparently drawn from imagination, founded on descriptions in the Old Testament. In these, the \"table for shew-bread\" is generally represented as having legs partly turned, with the upper portions square, to which rings were attached for the poles by which it was carried. As a nomadic people, their furniture would be but primitive, and we may take it that as the Jews and Assyrians came from the same stock, and spoke the same language, such ornamental furniture as there was would, with the exception of the representations of figures of men or of animals, be of a similar character. At least this is what Litchfield says, and he is no mean authority. -Doubtless prehistoric men made use of stones, logs, or piled-up sods, for seats, and for spots to rest their -heads ; the use of stones for pillows being quite common as late as early historic times. Be this as it may however, we find, the Egyptians had chairs, beds, tables and other furniture, some of which was highly wrought and ornamented, at least 4000 years before Christ, as shown by the monuments, and by the papyri that have come down to us. We also possess some fragments of bronze furniture of both Egyptian and Assyrian make. -The British Museum and the Louvre contain a few Egyptian chairs or seats that have been made in ebony and ivory, which owe their preservation to the lasting nature of the material. -Two Egyptian chairs or thrones are illustrated at Figs. 1 and 2, in the first part of this work. At Fig. 3, cabinet-makers are represented as occupied in chair making, the feet and legs of the chairs being designed from animals\\' limbs, and the stools on which the workmen are sitting are blocks of wood hollowed out at the top. The Egyptian couch was of a straight-lined design in the body with a curved head like an ordinary sofa, the legs, feet and other salient points being carved with heads, feet and tails of animals. -Some boxes and coffers with gable tops dovetailed together, small toilet boxes having carved or painted decoration, and Mummy cases of cedar-wood having elaborate hieroglyphic decorations, may be seen in the British Museum and in the Louvre. Chariot and horse furniture are well represented in the reliefs and wall -paintings. Egypt was famed for chariot building, and exported them in trade to the surrounding nations. We read that King Solomon imported his war-chariots from Egypt. -If examples of Egyptian furniture are scarce, the furniture of Assyria is practically non-existent, as the climate of the latter country was not so dry or preservative as that of Egypt, so that all examples thathave not been wilfully destroyed have long ago perished. Many ornaments of bronze and of ivory decorations have been discovered that have been used as mountings to feet, ends of legs of seats, chairs, or thrones. The -bas-reliefs of the latter enables us to form a fairly accurate judgment of the nature and style of Assyrian furniture, the decoration of which was of a heavier and coarser character than that of the more elegant Egyptian ( Fig. 4 and 5 ) . Forms and parts of animals -were used by the Assyrians and nearly all Oriental nations as furniture decorations. The human figure was also used, but generally in the representation of slaves or conquered peoples, who were degraded to the position of bearing the weight of the seat or throne of the monarch. The Egyptian chairs had also carved human figures as captives tied under the seat. -The furniture of the Hebrews was doubtless of the same kind as the Assyrian. From the description of King Solomon\\'s throne it was apparently similar to those of the Assyrian kings. It had lions for the arm supports, and had six lions in gold and ivory on the six steps on either side of the throne. -In the manufacture of the furniture of the nations of antiquity the principal materials were — in woods, ebony, rosewood, walnut, pine, teak, and, above all, cedarwood; ivory, gold, silver, bronze, and electrum were also much used for inlays and for solid mountings. -The furniture and the chariots of the Greeks in their early period were simply copied from Egyptian and Asiatic sources, with less of the animal forms and more of plant forms as decorative details (Figs. 6, 7). Folding stools and chairs were made in wood and in metal and the backs of the chairs Fl ^ re 4 were upright, or nearly so -(Figs. 8, 9 and 10) ; couches resembling modern sofas, elaborate foot-stools, and arm-chairs with the sphinxes for the arms were made by the Greeks. -In the British Museum are some small models of Greek chairs made in lead, and wooden boxes showing the dovetail construction. -In the later Greek periods the furniture was inlaid with ivory, ebony, gold, and silver. Tripods were made of bronze, and had ornamented legs in the shapes of the limbs of lions, leopards, and sphinxes. The Roman bronze tripods were very similar to the Grecian ones -in design, and were not only used for sacred purposes in the temples, but also to support braziers for heating purposes, or for burning perfumes in the houses of private people (Fig. 10). -Hand-mirrors and cistae were made in great quantities in bronze or in other metal alloys, in silver, and -sometimes in gold. The mirrors were polished on the face, and had often rich designs of figure subjects. The Greek cistae were cylindrical metal boxes that rested on feet designed from those of various animals, having a lid or cover, with a handle or knot usually of figure design, the whole surface of the body being covered with engraved figure compositions and ornamental borders. They were probably used to contain jewelry -and trinkets. Some very fine specimens of these handmirrors and cistae may be seen in the British Museum. -The furnishing of the houses of the Romans was very much of the same character as that of the Greeks -The interior plan and aspects of the Roman houses were such as those of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Tables and tripods of bronze or braziers were supported -on three legs, some of which were made with hinges for folding purposes (Fig. n), and others were of sphinx and animal forms of a rich design (Fig. 12). Lamp-stand designs were quaint and elegant and were -made in bronze (Fig. 13). Candelabra of architectural design were carved in marble and were from six to ten feet in height (Fig. 15). -The Romans highly prized and paid good sums for tables that were made from the pollard cross grain of different hard woods in which the knots and grain showed to advantage, the beauty of the wood being brought out by hand-polishing and by the staining it -with various colored dyes. Bird\\'s eye maple and the wood of the cedrus atlantica were much prized. The smaller tables, abaci, rested usually on one foot— monopodium — and larger tables had three or four legs, -which had ivory claws or heads of animals as carved decoration (Fig. 14). Boxwood, beech, and palm, inlaid with ivory, ebony, and precious metals, were used in the materials of chairs and couches. The latter were often made in bronze (Figs. 15 and 16), and chairs of state were carved in marble, one of this kind being in the Louvre, a cast of which is now in the Kensington Museum (Fig. 17). The form of the Roman curule chair was like the letter X, and was so called because it -could be folded and carried easily in the curules or chariots. It was used from the earliest times of the Romans down to modern days in Italy, and was often constructed of elephants\\' tusks, wood, or metal, with ivory feet. The curule chairs were carried about for outdoor use and for the theatre. The sella or bisellium. -to seat two persons, was often a very ornate kind of seat with turned legs similar to the couches (Fig. 18). -In the houses of the Romans a separate room or wardrobe was fitted up to keep the dresses and cloths of the family ; this room had cupboards with doors and shelves, drawers, and lockers. -Portable coffers and chests were used, in which they packed their cloths and valuables when carrying them to and from their town and country houses. The Roman furniture and wooden construction of their houses were decorated with paintings and carvings of animals\\' heads, limbs, and feet, and with the usual architectural acanthus foliage — veneering of woods was an art in which the Romans were skilled; both large and small design in Tazsia work were the chief decorations of the best furniture. -The representations we have of what was used by the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans, are those only of the most finished and tasteful specimens; and, consequently, materials do not exist for the formation of a chronological series. But if we examine such as are of subsequent date in Europe, the reply will be found amply to repay the trouble. -In endeavoring to obtain some little insight into the forms and materials of the furniture of ancient times, we are dependent on different sources, according to the country under consideration. If it be ancient Rome or Greece, the descriptions by the classical writers and the paintings at Pompeii are our chief authorities; if ancient Egypt, the paintings on the walls at Thebes and other places ; if in China or India, or Asia generally, the specimens still existing, for the Asiatics are more stationary in their usages than the inhabitants of any other quarter of the globe. Footstools seemed to have formed part of the furniture of a sitting-room; -they were made both solid and open at the sides, and were covered at the top with leather or interlaced string. -The distinction between a bed and a couch does not seem to have been very clearly marked. They had couches of wood with one end raised and receding in a graceful curve, with feet fashioned to resemble those of some wild animal. It is supposed that those couches had a rich covering by day and bedding by night. The use of wooden pillows was customary ; they were made of various materials, according to the rank of the possessor, and had a singular kind of cavity in which the head or the back of the neck might rest. Wicker bedsteads were sometimes made of palmbranches, forming a light kind of grating on which the bed and bedding were placed. The tables used were of various forms — round, square and ob-lar, and supported by a central pillar, which was often the figure of a man as a captive. Other tables had three or four legs, and the material of the tables themselves, though generally wood, was sometimes metal or stone. -It is curious to remark that Egypt exhibited, three or four thousand years ago, articles of furniture bearing a much closer resemblance to those of modern Europe than Egypt does at the present day. The chairs of the early times might in many cases be readily mistaken for those now in use among ourselves; whereas the divans and cushions of modern Egypt, on which the natives indolently recline, belong to the oriental system of furniture. In Cairo no chambers are furnished as bed-rooms. The bed, in the day-time, is rolled up and placed on one side, or in an adjoining closet, which is a sleeping-place in the winter. In summer many persons sleep upon the house-tops. The furniture of a room is comprised pretty nearly by the mat or carpet spread upon the floor, and the divans or cushioned couches. For meals a round tray is brought in and placed upon a low stool, and the company sit round it on the ground. There is no fire-place, the room being warmed when necessary by charcoal burning in a chafing-dish. -Passing from Egypt to China, we find, in treating of the furniture of a room, as in many other matters, how singularly isolated the Chinese are from the other -nations of Asia, and how much more closely they resemble Europeans. The Chinese are the only Asiatic -people who customarily use chairs; they resemble the solid and heavy chairs in fashion during the early part of the 1 8th century; (see illustration of Chinese chair). The seat of the chair has often a cushion, and the back a hanging of scarlet silk or woolen embroidered with silk. In the forms of their Figure 17 furniture the Chinese gen-erally avoid straight and uniform lines; even in their doorways, instead of a regular right-angled opening, they often have one presenting the form of a circle, or an oval, or a leaf, or a jar. These fanciful doorways, however, are only used when there are no doors, the opening being covered with hanging screens of silk or cloth, or with bamboo blinds, like those used in India. The Chinese beds are generally simple in form, with cotton or silk curtains in winter, and a fine mosquito-screen during the heat of summer; the bed of an individual among the middle classes usually consists of two or three boards laid upon a couple of narrow benches, a mat to lie upon, and four bamboo-sticks to support the mosquito-curtains. It may readily be sup-posed that in the original country of porcelain a very usual ornament of dwellings consists in vases and jars of that material, of which the antiquity is valued above -every other quality. This taste has led to the manufacture of fictitious antiques, not only in porcelain, but in bronze and other substances — points in which strangers are lgure often very egregiously -taken in at Canton. The shapes of their tripods and other ancient vessels, real or imitated, are often fantastical, and not unlike similar vestiges in Europe. -The furniture, such as tables, chairs, beds, and the chariots of the Byzantine period, was like the architecture in having something of the classic Roman mixture with some Asiatic Greek forms in its design. Scarcely any remains of such are now in existence, although we have evidences of the extreme richness of the sumptuary furniture and vessels of the great houses and palaces of Constantinople, for owing to the decadence and destruction of the Roman empire in the provinces, the capital of the East became enriched by treasures of the Roman families, who naturally fled to Constantinople for protection for themselves and their valuable effects. -different varieties of seats, chairs, and footstools, on which the consuls are seated, represented in the carving. Many originals of these and casts from others, are now in the Kensington Museum, London. -The chair of St. Maximian, preserved at Ravenna, is covered with ivory carvings, and is one of the finest examples of Byzantine work. -Much of the furniture of the early centuries of Christian art is represented in the Byzantine illuminated manuscripts. Beds and couches kept the old Roman forms with the turned legs. Chariots must have been used very much, as the old game of chariot racing was kept up by the Byzantines. The Iconoclasts of the Eastern Empire under Leo the Isaurian (A. D. 726) — -whose injurious rule lasted about one hundred and twenty years — were responsible for much destruction -of sumptuary furniture, as well as for other productions of an artistic nature, but at the same time they were the indirect means of causing a new development in art in the western parts of Europe, and more particularly in -the Rhenish Provinces, by driving the Byzantine artists and craftsmen to these places, where they were welcomed by Charlemagne, and by his powerful nobles and churchmen. In the course of time they succeeded in founding the school of art known as Rhenish-Byzantine. The finest illustrations of this art are seen in the magnificent enamelled reliquaries or shrines. The giltbronze chair of Dagobert is of Romanesque design, and is one of the earliest pieces of furniture of the Middle Ages (see Fig. 19). Another mediaeval chair or throne is high seated, and exceedingly rich in design (Fig. 20). It is of Scandinavian origin, and is a good example of the Romanesque style of Northern Europe. Many forms of the Romanesque are seen in the furniture and carving of the Gothic style that immediately succeeded the former. -During the Anglo-Saxon period in England the ordinary houses usually consisted of one room. Sometimes a shed-like structure was erected against the wall of the room to contain the bed of the mistress of the house, and as a rule the inmates slept on a large table placed in the center of the room, or on benches on which bags of straw were placed. Seats without backs, or stools, long settles or benches with backs and carved ends or arms, were the chief articles in furniture. -After the Norman Conquest domestic improvements were multiplied, more rooms were added to the houses, such as the solar or upper room, and the parlor or -talking room, and some of the rooms had fireplaces, but not chimneys. The principal room was the hall or assembly-room, which had a fireplace in the center, the smoke escaping through the lantern light in the roof. In the Norman times the principal additions to the furniture of English manor-houses and castles were the cupboard, presses or armoires, and chests. These pieces -of furniture were introduced from France. Sometimes the portable presses and the chests were painted with tempera decorations, and were bound with wroughtiron clasps and hinges, which were just beginning to come into use. -The bed-clothes and personal clothing of the nobles and rich landowners began to assume a rich character, and were often embroidered. -Tapestry and painted cloth hangings were imported ; also pottery of an ornamental description was not only imported, but made in England at this time. All this -applies to the homes of the rich only, for the poorer classes remained for a long period in a very primitive condition as regards their style of houses and their furniture. -The construction of furniture and the panelling of chests began to exhibit some workmanlike appearances of good carpentry. Panels were placed in framework that was mortised and fastened with wooden pegs, which became the universal method of panelling throughout the Gothic period. Room paneling came into use in England in the early part of the thirteenth century, Figure 23 when pine timber was used at first -for this work, but was displaced later by the more substantial oak. This oak panelling during the Gothic periods was often carved with elaborate tracery of an architectural character (Figs. 21, 22), and a common design was a carved imitation of a carefully folded textile, known as the \"linen panel\" (Fig. 23). -Chests were used as tables, and the tops had inlaid checkers to be used as chessboards. They were also used as sideboards on which to place dishes of food, the dining-table being a board which was placed on trestles, that could be removed and packed away when not required (Figs. 24, 25). A crossed-legged chair and a three-legged stool is shown at Fig. 2j, which -were common shapes in the fourteenth century. The illustration, Fig. 26, is that of a bedroom of the same -period, and is taken from an English manuscript of the date of 1400. For these illustrations, and many others -on the subject of furniture, we are indebted to the work of Mr. J. H. Pollen on \"Furniture and Woodwork.\" -The bed in the latter illustration has a flat canopy, or tester, with embroidered hangings. The walls of the room are panelled, and the floor is in checkered par-quetry. There is a curious seat that is partly an open press, with pottery, and metal vases placed as decoration on the top. -Chests, trunks, or bahuts, were at this period, and in the time of the Normans, the most important articles in furniture; they were often made with inlaid wood decorations, and had strapwork of iron and ornate -hinges. They were the usual repositories of the household valuables, money, and other treasures, and were carried on horses or mules when the family moved about from place to place. By degrees the chest, with the addition of a back and arms, became the settles or principal seats in the living-room, and the back developed with an added hood or projecting covering into -Another and later development of the chest was to raise it on legs, and to add a back arrangement to it, with shelves for the display of household plate, to which was given the name of dressoir, or dresser, the latter in time developing into the modern sideboard. -Chests were also important articles of church furniture, in which the sacred vessels, treasures, books, and priests\\' garments couljd be locked up, and a particular -form of chest kept in church vestries was the cope chest, which took the semicircular shape of the copes when laid out flat in these chests. Examples of these chests are still to be seen in some of the larger cathedrals. -The coronation chair (Fig. 28) gives a good idea of a state chair of the early Gothic period in England. -Carriages of the fourteenth century were used for the conveyance of women and children, but were not very common. They were longshaped covered vehicles on four wheels, with or without paneled sides, and were painted and decorated (Figs. 29, 30). Carts for carrying and for agricultural purposes were used in the Anglo-Saxon and Norman periods in England, and in France at the same dates; these were twowheeled vehicles, each being usually of one solid piece of wood. -The Saracens were very ingenious in the using of wood, as in carpentry, carving, and turning in the lathe. Their ingenuity and skill in carpentry and turning is seen in the Meshrebiya work and lattice, and in the carvings of the pulpit and door panels. -Regarding the furniture of the domestic dwellings of the Saracens, whether of Egypt, Arabia, or elsewhere, there was very little of a movable nature except the small tables and reading-desks. The tables of Saracenic design are usually small and of a greater height than width ( Fig. 31). These tables or kursys are sometimes panelled with turned, latticed, or carved decoration, having stalactites under the top, as in the illustration, -or in the kursys of a lighter construction are generally inlaid with ivory, ebony, and mother-of-pearl. Some of the richest variety are hexagonal in shape, are inlaid with brass and silver filigree ornamentation, and are of splendid workmanship. The next important article in movable furniture is the Saracen reading-desk, which is made in the form of a camp-stool, with cross legs. It is usually inlaid and decorated like the tables. -The divans are platforms raised slightly from the ground, and covered with cushions on the seats and backs. The carved cupboards or shelves on brackets -placed behind and above the divans, on which vases and trays are kept for ornament or when not in use, complete the usual furniture. of the Saracenic livingroom. Seats or chairs or lattice-work (dikkas), on -which the doorkeeper sits, are usually found in entrance-halls, and if we add the elaborate metal and colored-glass lamps, the vases, the large metal salvers or trays, and the rugs and carpets, the furniture of a Saracenic house is complete. -In the early part of the fifteenth century and during the whole of the century the furniture of Europe generally was designed more or less on Gothic lines, but gradually the new forms that were now rapidly developing in the architecture of the Renaissance, but in a slower measure, began to assert themselves in furniture designs. Consequently, we find in many articles, such as armoires or presses, and cabinets, a mixture of style in the design — as, for instance, the upper panels would be in the Mediaeval, and the lower ones in the Renaissance style, or the general construction would be Gothic, and the details and decoration would be Italian. -This was more often the case in the furniture and other art in Germany, where the Renaissance was tardily welcomed. -Styles of design in furniture overlap each other so much, especially in the Renaissance period, that it became very difficult to assign a correct date to many pieces of important work. Gothic designs continued to be used during the sixteenth century, although the Renaissance had been developing for a hundred years -earlier. The most authentic means of fixing the date is when certain work can be proved to have come from the hand of a particular artist, or when there is a record of its having been made for a king or some great person, for the style is not always a sure proof of the correct date. -In the \"Quattrocento\" period (1400-1500), or fifteenth century, Italian furniture made for churches, palaces, or private houses, was usually decorated with paintings, sometimes on a gilt ground, which was prepared in a gesso material before the gold was applied, some parts of which had relief ornamentation. -Reliquaries, altar-fronts, panels or cabinets, chests, and marriage coffers were decorated in this way. -The work known as \"tarsia,\" or certosina work, was made in great perfection about this time in Italy. It is inlaid work of a geometric character in design, or is composed of floral ornament, and sometimes consists of representations of landscapes and buildings. This kind of inlay derived from Persian sources, was developed chiefly by the Venetians, and was used mostly by them in the decoration of their stalls, tables, chairs, cabinets, &c. Ebony, ivory, and metals were also employed in the Italian inlays of this period. -The Italian cassoni, or marriage coffers, were the most ornate and most imposing articles of furniture of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. They were placed in the long halls and corridors of the palaces and great -houses, and were usually given as presents to newly married couples. They were generally used as the receptacle for the bride\\'s trousseau and other treasures. In the latter century they were carved in walnut with sculptural mythological subjects, and had endings or corners of half-figures and half-foliage, as caryatids, -with feet designed from the claws of animals to raise them from the ground (Fig. 32). The carving was relieved by gilding in parts, and sometimes the whole of it was gilt. -Other examples of an earlier date were covered with a finely modelled decoration of gesso work, and gilded, and in other cases the large panels in the front were painted with figure subjects in brilliant colors and heightened with gold. -A less costly kind of marriage coffer was made in cypress-wood, and fitted up in the inside with drawers, having the decoration on the surface engraved or etched -in brown lines, with the ground slightly recessed and punched or stamped with a fine ornamentation. -In the Kensington Museum there is an extensive collection of Italian cassoni embracing all the above varieties. Chairs carved and gilt of the same style and period as the coffers were usually placed between the rows of the latter in the halls of the Italian palaces (Fig. 33). These chairs had their backs and legs richly carved, each part being made out of a single slab of wood. -The pair of bellows (Fig. 34) is a further illustration of the design and excellence of workmanship as shown in the work of the wood carvers of Italy in the sixteenth century, or \"Cinquecento\" period. -Another fine specimen of wood carving is the Italian stool (Fig. 35) of the same date, which is remarkable for its delicacy of treatment. -Another form of chair of a rectangular character, with or without arms, having an embossed leather or velvet covering on the back and seat, with turned and carved legs and rails, was made in Italy about this time (Fig. 36) ; it was much used subsequently in Spain, France, and in England, and has continued to be in favor down to the present day. -Cabinets were made in Italy and in France in which slabs of beautifully colored and veined marbles and rare stones were inserted as panels in various shapes, to which the name of \"pietradura\" work was given. -In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries painted plaques of porcelain took the place of these marbles. -In England, France, Spain, and Germany, the great houses, both private and religious, and the king\\'s palaces were elaborately furnished, and kept in a state of great splendor. -Churches were also furnished with elaborate stalls, pulpits, and rich utensils, but in the latter the style of the designs was still Mediaeval. -In the reigns of Henry VII. and Henry VIII. in England the style gradually altered to the Italian forms of the Renaissance, and great quantities of Italian, Flemish, and French furniture were largely imported. Jean de Mabuse and Torrigiano were employed as architects and sculptors by Henry VII. , and Holbein and some Italian artists designed furniture and goldsmith\\'s work for Henry VIII. -In France, during the reigns of Francois I., Catherine de Medici, and Henry II., a great activity took place in architecture and in all the industrial arts, in which that country was not only imitated, but sought to excel, the work of the Italian schools. -As already mentioned, the French kings and Medicean princesses in the sixteenth century had invited from Italy Cellini, Primaticcio, II Rosso, Serlio, and others, who succeeded in founding the style of the Renaissance in France, and about the same time many French artists journeyed to Italy to acquire the newer style which had been evolved from the study of the old classic remains of that country. Among the names of the principal French artists, sculptors, and carvers of this period are those of Jean Goujon, Nicholas Bachelier of Toulouse, Jean Cousin, Germain Pilon, Philibert de L\\'Orme, Du Cerceau, who published -designs for all kinds of decorations and carvings, and Hugues Sambin of Dijon. Most of these men were -architects and also designers of the heavy and rich furniture that was characteristic of the French Renaissance. Some of these artists and their works have been noticed in the chapters on Renaissance architecture and metal work. The cabinet (Fig. 37) is a good example of the architecturic style of French furniture of the sixteenth century. French wood carving is distinguished from the -Italian of this period by the great use of the cartouche and strap-work (Fig. 38), which was so characteristic of the Henri-Deux style. -When the Renaissance had taken a firm root in Germany, the designers and carvers of altar-pieces and of furniture generally proved themselves thorough masters of the style, and were especially skilful in the carving of wood, both on a gigantic and on a minute scale. Whole fronts of houses were elaborately carved in designs consisting of figure work, animals, ornament, and grotesques of a quaint and humorous description, while exceedingly minute works of figure subjects and animals were carved in box and other woods with a delicacy and quaintness often excelling the ivory carvings of the Japanese. Escritoires, buffets, cabinets, and other furniture, were made and exported from Germany into Spain and other countries. -Flemish and English furniture and carving were pretty much alike in the reigns of Elizabeth — the Tudor period of English art — and of James L, the Stuart of Jacobean. The pieces of carved furniture, both Flemish and English, were very solid and heavy both in the design and thickness of material, which was generally of oak or chestnut. So much Flemish furniture was imported into England at this time, and the Englishmade work, being so close in resemblance to the former, that a great difficulty is experienced in classifying examples of this period. The table, Fig. 39, and the socalled \"Great Bed of Ware,\" are examples of the furniture of the Elizabethan period (Fig. 40). -duced in the first instance by the great importations from Italy and Germany, but under such excellent native carvers and designers as Felipe de Borgona (six-teenth century), and Berruguete (i 480-1 561), the style of the Renaissance soon spread from Toledo to Seville and Valladolid, where great quantities of carved and inlaid work and elaborate altar-pieces were executed during the prosperous Spanish period of the sixteenth century. -During the same century Venice and Florence were famed for their marquetry — inlaid work of ivory and metal — in cypres s, walnut, and other woods, which art -had been imported from Persia and India by the Venetians, and which spread rapidly through Europe until the furniture made with marquetry decoration by degrees supplanted the heavier classical architectural designs. -Before leaving the Italian sixteenth-century work we must notice the mirrors, with their elaborately carved frames of Venetian design and manufacture. In this century Venice was renowned for the making of glass, for which it is still famous, and certain privileges were granted by the State exclusively to Venetian manufacturers of looking-glasses. Two Murano glass makers named Andrea and Dominico, who were the inventors, were granted in the year 1507 the sole privilege of making \"mirrors of crystal glass\" for a term of twenty years. Previous to this time the mirrors -were made of various polished metals. The frames of the Venetian mirrors were often elaborately carved (Fig. 41), some of them being made in designs that were strictly architectural in character, representing a door, or window frame, with pilasters frieze, and cornice and sill or plinth. These carved frames were often part or wholly gilt, and were exported in considerable quantities. Pictures were framed in a similar way to the mirrors, and carved and gilt frames were soon used all over Europe as picture frames. Later on gilt furniture of all kinds was made in Venice and was in great favor in the other countries of the Continent. -The manufacture of marquetry furniture by the Dutch in the seventeenth century has been mentioned as having helped in a great measure to change the style of furniture design from its former architectural character to a greater simplicity of construction. Large panel surfaces were used for the purpose of showing to greater advantage the rich and bright colors of different kinds of hard woods used in the marquetry. Both natural and stained varieties of various wood were arranged in the designs in juxta-position, and a free and picturesque kind of ornamental foliage was employed mixed with large tulips, roses, and birds in the Dutch marquetry decoration. Other materials such as ivory, ebony, and mother-of-pearl, were also used as inlays. In France a similar kind of marquetry -was developed, but the design consisted more of figure subjects and imitations of ruins in landscapes. A complete change in the design of the furniture in the latter country was also effected by the same desire to get large surface on which the inlaid work could be seen to great advantage, and the spaces were not divided by architectural mouldings, and the pilasters, as they had been in the preceding earlier work. Towards the end of the sixteenth century, and during the earlier half of the seventeenth, the sumptuous furniture, the beds, and general furnishing of the better class of houses and palaces in France and other European countries, were characterized by the use of costly silk brocades, tissues, and embroidered coverings and hangings. -By thus seeking to give the furniture an appearance of the richest possible kind, such articles as chairs, couches, and beds lost in a corresponding degree their elegance and former constructive beauty. Under their gorgeous Italian and Oriental velvet coverings, their framed construction ceased to be visible. The above pieces of furniture still retained their sumptuous upholstery during the reign of Louis XIV., but the tables, armoires. cabinets, book-cases, pedestals, clock-stands -and cases, came under the influence of the architecture of the period, when the king\\'s chief minister, Colbert, selected the best architects and cabinet-makers of the day to design the furniture for the palaces of the Tuileries, the Louvre, and Fontainebleau. -The greatest name connected with the design and manufacture of the magnificent furniture of the Louis-Quatorze period is that of Andre-Charles Boulle, whose work is known under his name as \"Boulle.\" This celebrated furniture is an elaborate kind of marquetry of which the materials are rare woods, ebony, tortoiseshell, brass, mother-of-pearl, and white metal or tin. The mountings, mouldings, and other salient points are made in brass beautifully chased and finished, some of the mouldings being in the forms of masks, foliages, cartouches, and animals\\' heads and feet as termination. Andre-Charles Boulle was born in Paris in the year -1642. His father, Pierre Boulle was also a distinguished ebeniste, or cabinet-maker, but his more eminent son possessed the artistic gift in a much higher degree. In addition to making his special marquetry from his own designs Boulle also executed a good deal of his best works from the design of Jean Berain ( 1636171 1 ), his chief collaborateur. Berain\\'s designs were more Italian in style, more symmetrical in the composition of the ornament, and more correct from an architectural point of view, than those attributed to Boulle himself, whose designs had much of the looseness and freedom of the prevalent Louis Ouatorze. -At the death of Jean Mace, the king\\'s ebeniste, in 1672, who had formerly lived in the royal galleries of the Louvre, the logement and office of ebeniste to the king had become vacant, and Boulle on the recommendation of Colbert, minister to Louis XIV., was appointed as the successor of Mace, and was installed in his rooms in the Louvre in the year 1673. He na< ^ previously executed some important work for the king, and was known as the ablest ebeniste at that time in Paris. -The origin of the Boulle marquetry can be traced to the Indian, Persian, and Damascus encrusted inlays in ivory, ebony, and metal, that found their way to Venice, Portugal, Spain, and France in the Middle Ages. These works consisted chiefly of caskets, coffers, and small pieces of furniture In the inventories of -Charles V. of France (1380) mention is made of lecterns and coffers of inlaid ivory or bone, in ebony, and similar works are mentioned in the inventories of Charles VI. (1418), and of Anne of Brittany (1498). These are the earliest notices of marquetry furniture that was made in France, and was probably an imitation of Oriental work. -In the Renaissance period Francois I. bought some magnificent furniture of Indian workmanship, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, from Portuguese merchants, and mention is made of chairs, tables, coffers, cabinets, and mirror-frames that belonged to Queen Marie de Medicis (1600), the Cardinal d\\'Amboise (1500), and other great persons of the French Court, all of which works were made in marquetry. -In France before the sixteenth century, tortoiseshell, brass, tin, and exotic woods were used as inlays, in addition to the ivory, ebony, and nacre of the East. From this it will be seen that Boulle did not invent the celebrated marquetry that bears his name. He, however, brought this sumptuous form of cabinet work to great perfection, and under the patronage of Louis XIV. he had every opportunity to develop his artistic abilities to the utmost. -The method of procedure in the making of the Boulle marquetry was, first, to prepare the veneers of wood, shell, tin, and brass of the same thickness, each having perfectly plain surfaces; these veneers were -then glued together in pairs of opposite materials, according to the nature of the effect required in the -finished work, and were held together firmly in a vice. The design was then traced on the surface of the upper leaf, and the veneers were then cut through the lines of -the pattern with a burin, a sharp strong knife, or a fine saw; thus four pieces of marquetry were made at one cutting. When the plaque forming the design was composed of tin or brass, which was afterwards engraved or chased, it was technically called \"boulle\" ; and when the design was formed by the shell or ebony it was called \"counter\"; the two effects are together known as \"boulle and counter\" or premiere et contrepartie. -A later kind of Boulle work, known as the Second Style, has the shell veneers laid on a clouded vermilion or on a gilt ground. -Boulle was an artist of great excellence as a sculptor and chaser of metals; his mountings of foliage and masks which decorated his works are spirited in design and are skilfully chased and finished (Fig. 42). He executed a great number of costly pieces of his famous marquetry for Louis XIV. and the Dauphin of France, many of which found their way to England a century later. Examples of Boulle work fetch great prices when, as on rare occasions, they make their appearance in a sale. -In Germany in the seventeenth century, the most prominent names as designers and makers of furniture are Philip Heinhofer, Baumgartner, and Hans Schwanhard. The former was the maker of the celebrated Pomeranian Cabinet (1611-1617) which is now in the Royal Museum at Berlin. -In this century, in Italy, Andrea Brustolone (16701732) was noted as a carver, gilder, and cabinet-maker who worked in the extravagant style of the Louis Quinze (Louis XV.), and in the first half of the -eighteenth century (1700-77) Pifetti, a Piedmontese cabinet-maker, was honored by the Italian Court, for which he executed many works in ivory carving and marquetry work in the style of Boulle. Many other cabinet-makers and carvers were employed to make furniture and to decorate the queen\\'s palace at Turin, among whom may be mentioned the names of Galleti, the successor of Pifetti, and Maggiolino of Milan, who -chiefly made a kind of marquetry in light woods. We are indebted to Mr. J. H. Pollen\\'s handbook on furniture for some of these names, and a list of many others will be found at the end of his useful book. -The French architect, Le Pantre (1617-82), designed furniture and decoration in the heavy classical style of the Roman antique, mixed with shell-work, grotesques, and little Cupids or \"putti,\" and also engraved and published a book of studies of Roman ornament from sketches that his master, Adam Phillipon, had made in Italy. He worked with Le Brun, the painter and director of the decoration at Versailles. Le Brun\\'s own work was heavy and dull, although he aimed at grandeur and gorgeousness of effect. He was director of the Gobelins tapestry manufactory, and his style of work was in harmony with the pompous ideas of Louis the \"Grand Monarch.\" Madame de Maintenon says in one of her letters to a friend, that Louis was so fond of symmetry and stateliness in his architecture, as in other things, that he would have you \"perish in his symmetry,\" for he caused his doors and windows to be constructed in pairs opposite to one another, which gave to everybody who lived in his palaces their death of cold by draughts of air. -In this century and early in the following one, the art of wood carving was greatly developed in England, chiefly owing to the genius of Grinling Gibbons and to the influence of Sir Christopher Wren, the style de-veloped being a more or less realistic or baroque form of the Renaissance (Figs. 44 and 45). Gibbons carried -out some of his carvings to an astonishing degree of realism: bouquets of flowers, festoons of fruit and flowers, birds, figures, and drapery were executed by him in the highest possible relief, which looked de-tached from the ground, and yet they usually formed a part of the solid wood with the background. Ornament was carved with a singular crispness, and apparently without any hesitation on the part of the carver. Though we may condemn the florid looseness of the style of Gibbons, we must admire the dexterity of workmanship and general technical excellence imparted to everything he touched. Some of his best work may still be seen at Chatsworth, Petworth House in Sussex, Lyme Hall in Cheshire, St. Paul\\'s Cathedral, and Trinity College Chapel at Oxford. -Under the Regency of Philippe d\\'Orleans in France (17 1 5-1 723) decoration and ornament assumed a light and fanciful character, very naturalistic, but still having some classic details; of this style Claude Gillot is the chief exponent. Watteau, his pupil, made a great name as a painter of pastoral scenes, fetes galantes, and all kinds of light and daintily-treated subjects of a theatrical and artificial kind of composition. His color was silvery and harmonious, and sometimes he decorated furniture with pastoral scenes. -The Rococo style had begun under the Regency, if not earlier, and such men as Oppenort, the De Cottes, father and son, Francois de Cuvillies, the Italians Bernini and Borromini, and lastly the great apostle of the Rococo, Meissonier, were all designers of furniture or architects who belonged to the period of Louis XV., and who executed works that reflected the loose and -unrestrained character of the times (1723-1774). Chinese and naturalistic elements were grafted on, or mixed with, the former Louis Quatorze, with an addition of still life that did duty for architectural form in objects of pottery and metal work, and a combination of shell work; all these elements made up the style known under the different names of rococo, rocaille, baroque, or Louis Quinze. -Furniture was made with curved and swelling panels to show to more advantage the marquetry, or paintings on gold grounds ; these kinds of panels and friezes were known as \"bombe.\" -It is said that the Italian architects, Bernini and Borromini, were the first to introduce the rococo style into France, but no designer went so far in the wilderness of its vagaries as the French Meissonier. His ornament furnishes a perfect example of the want of balance and symmetry. He designed for furniture, woodwork, silver-smithery, and modelled decoration, all of which work illustrated the broken shell-shaped panels with frilled and scalloped edgings and curved mouldings. -Rooms were lined with looking-glasses having these rocaille mouldings, which were well adapted to show to the best advantage the glitter of the gold leaf that was used inordinately on the furniture and decoration of the Louis-Ouinze period. -were the usual color decorations of ceilings, furniture, carriages, and a host of minor articles such as fans, etuis, snuff-boxes, &c. The latter smaller articles, as well as the state, carriages, were decorated with paint-ings in what was known as the Vernis-Martin style. Martin was a decorator of carriages and an heraldic painter, who invented the particular hard varnish or lacquer which bears his name. It was quite likely that this was as near as possible a successful imitation of the Japanese gold lacquer that decorated the articles which were at this period imported from Japan by the Dutch and Portuguese traders into Europe. Carriages, tables, cabinets, and especially smaller articles like snuff-boxes and needle-cases, were painted and decorated in \"Vernis-Martin.\" Some of the smaller objects were beautifully mounted in chased gold. -It was quite a common practice to cover or to panel furniture with plaques of Japanese lacquer, and to mount them in chased metal or ormoulu decorations. A unique commode is illustrated at Fig. 47, made from panels of very old Japanese lacquer and highly decorated with ormoulu mounts by Caffieri, a skilled chaser of the Louis-Quinze period. -In the latter half of the eighteenth century an improvement in the design of furniture and of ornament generally crept in, owing to the study of the ornamentation and design of the classic objects that had been found in the buried cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii. These cities had been discovered in 171 3, and about forty or fifty years later books were published illustrating the buried remains, which helped to change -The prevailing taste was then apparently gratified by the mixture or grafting of a certain quality of classic forms with the former frivolous style of the Louis Quinze. -The style in furniture and in ornament now developed into what is known as the \"Louis Seize\\'* (Louis XVI.), and consisted in its ornament of a composition of then scrolls, garlands, bows and quivers of arrows, ribbons and knots, medallions with classic cameo-cut subjects. Mouldings were fine and delicately ornamented and of straight line variety; in fact, the straight line now reasserted itself in architecture and furniture design (see Figs. 48, 49), in refreshing and healthy contrast to the tottering and riotous curves of Louis XV. and the Du Barry period. -Some of the most beautiful furniture expressive of the utmost elegance was made by Riesner and David, and was decorated with ormoulu mounts by Gouthiere for the Queen Marie Antoinette. Riesner and Gouthiere were the ablest men of their time, who generally worked together in the making and decorating of the finest furniture of this period. There is in the Jones Collection at South Kensington some of the very finest examples of this furniture, much of which was made for Marie Antoinette (Figs. 50, 51). -woods, such as tulip-wood, holly, maple, laburnum, purple-wood, and rosewood, for his marquetry work, and used oak for the linings and foundations. -The best pieces of David and Riesner were usually mounted in ormoulu or bronze-gilt metal by Gouthiere, who has never been equalled as a founder and chaser -of this class of work. Prieur was also a good chaser of the Louis Seize period. Delafosse was an architect and designer of furniture and decoration of the period, whose designs were of a more heavy and classical kind. Cauvet was a German who worked in Paris, and designed graceful arabesques and figure work, and who published a book of designs. Lalonde designed work that might be classed in the same category as that of Cauvet, and Salembier was a prolific designer of a light and free kind of arabesque. Many of his designs for silk may be seen in the fabric at the Silk Museum in the Bourse at Lyons. Le Notre designed for furniture, carving, and was also famed with La Quintinie as a designer of the state and public gardens. -In Italy the prevailing ornament in furniture and decoration was more classical than in France. Piranesi, Albertolli, Pergolese, and Bartolozzi are names of the principal designers of this country in the eighteenth century, most of whom published extensive works on ornament. The latter two were brought to England by the brothers John and Robert Adam (17281792), who had travelled in Italy, bringing also with them classical ideas, which they developed in England, and which influenced to a great extent the style of architecture and furniture design in this country. The Adelphi building and the houses in Portland Place were built from designs by the Adams. -&c., were made from their designs. Fine mouldings, medallions, rosettes, light garlands, capitals in classic form, fluted pilasters and columns, were all designed by them with the utmost restraint in style — even to coldness. -Thomas Chippendale was a famous cabinet-maker of the eighteenth century. His furniture, or even any good imitation of it, fetches a good price at the present time. He published a book on furniture design and interior decoration in the year 1764. His sons are supposed to have made nearly all the best of the mahogany furniture known as \"Chippendale.\" -The parlor chairs (Figs. 52 and 53) are good examples of Chippendale furniture, and the chairs made -well-known cabinet-makers, who made excellent mahogany furniture in the last century, both of whom published works on the subject at the latter end of the century. -The names of Gillow, Lichfield, Lock, and Copland are those of eminent cabinet-makers and decorators of -In France, after the Revolution (1792), more decided phase of the dry and heavy classicisms was apparent in the furniture design and decoration of the period ( 1801 ). This return to the classic heaviness has been attributed to the influence of the academic painter David, but is more likely to have been a pandering to the national worship of Napoleon and the French Empire. It seemed to have been the universal desire to make everything echo or reflect in some measure the glory of the Emperor Napoleon I. The meanest thing had some symbol or allusion by the way of decoration that should remind everybody of the greatness of the new monarch and of the French Empire, and consequently the heavy and ponderous style of that period was known as the \"Empire Style.\" The furniture of the Empire was usually made in mahogany, decorated with mountings in brass or bronze, of sphinxes, griffins, Roman emblems, and antique scrollery. -Percier and Fontaine are names of French cabinetmakers and designers who worked in the Empire style, and who published a book of their designs. (Fig. 55.) -In England the style was copied, and endless imitations of the French fashion in tables, sofas, chairs, cabinets, and clocks were designed after the same antique ideals. -century the mediaeval Gothic style was partly revived in architecture and in furniture, mainly owing to the efforts of W. Pugin, the architect. He designed many -pieces of furniture, and published a work consisting of Gothic designs in the year 1835. Notwithstanding the efforts of Pugin and some other eminent architects and \"purists,\" no particular lasting impression was made in this direction. -If we except a few of the best cabinet-makers\\' shops, where in the present day some furniture of good design -is made, the majority of such work is now made by machinery, or is often too much the work of the upholsterer, and is consequently less artistic and more mechanical in both design and construction. -Some of the most beautiful of Japanese and Chinese manufacture is made in carved wood and lacquered in black or red. Cabinets with drawers and quaintly contrived cupboards and recesses (Fig. 55) are made by the Japanese, finished in lacquers, and inlaid with ivory and mother of pearl. The Chinese are especially skilled in carving red lac-work. Some vases of great dimensions and of exquisite workmanship in this material may be seen in the various Museums. Lac-work is also executed with great skilfulness by the natives of India. Bracelets, armlets, or golias, are made of lac in various colors, the golden decorations of which are made from tinfoil and varnished with a yellow varnish made of myrrh, copal, and sweet oil boiled together. Boxes, bedposts, and other furniture, made in wood or papiermache, are lacquered and decorated with flat renderings of flowers and convenFigure 5: -tional shapes of animals and birds (Figs. 56, 57). All kinds of toys, weights and measures, cooking utensils, circular playing-cards, turnery, etc., are objects in small wares made in the choicest lac-work of India. -In looking back through the past ages, since the days of the supremacy of the Roman Empire, and after listening to the wonderful tales of the magnificent luxury and extreme prodigality of the sovereigns who reigned, and of the Lords and Ladies who lived in those times, we are led to suppose that the furniture of these palaces was of a kind that if it could be restored to its original splendour would strike our eyes in this present generation as something great in architectural beauty and dazzling in its gorgeousness. -We have learned to look with longing eyes on the Ottoman Empire as the place where luxurious ease has reached the highest attainable point within the limits of human skill, and think that the harem of the Turkish Vizier must be a sort of fairy palace lined with silk and satin, and full of couches so soft and easy that to recline on them is enough to send one to sleep. -If the truth were told, not one person in ten has anything like a proper idea of what furniture was in days gone by; and stranger yet, except in a few instances, people know very little about the finest furniture of the present day. One shop will turn out a bedstead, an-other a set of frames, and so on, but the people that make them seldom see them after they are finished, and in a house that is carpeted, curtained, and completely furnished, and if they did, would scarcely recognize them as the results of their handiwork. -The majority of people obtain their ideas of furniture, modern as well as ancient, from reading, and twothirds of the descriptions of furniture that are written are fabrications of some fertile brain that does not know a sideboard with a glass in it from a bureau. Therefore when we read accounts of ancient furniture and its great superiority over that in use now, first see whence the authority comes before believing it all. We have seen accounts of the magnificence of the furniture of the Romans in the time of Constantine ; of the tables and chairs inlaid with gold, silver, and precious stones ; of ease and barbaric splendour that was startling; whereas the same chairs and tables were as uncouth and cumbersome and uncomfortable as most people believe them to be comfortable and elegant. They may have been heavy with gems, but the gems were beautiful — not the chairs. -In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries more attention was paid to the architectural part of furniture than at any time before or since, but they lacked comfort, and we owe it to the French that instead of following the true principles of architecture and endeavouring to furnish luxury with art, they adopted a gaudy tinsel -style that had no art and little comfort. Marie Antoinette set a fashion of glitter and glare, and in her time more money was spent in gorgeous furniture than at any other since the dark ages, not even excepting the shoddy time within our own recollection. -Although there is much fault to be found with modern furniture, at no time has it been any better than it is now, to meet the wants of the people — and while we condemn the want of architectural merit, much, particularly in the richer classes, of the present day, is superior to that of the ancients. The furniture of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries had artistic merit and but little comfort, and was so rude in construction that the beauty of design was lost in the rough, unfinished look it presented, while today high finish, elegance of construction, and inviting look of comfort, do much to retard the introduction of pure architecture. When these two things, art and comfort, are combined, as they well may be, and soon will be, for we are glad to see the inclination in that way, it will be said years hence that the people of the nineteenth century were the first to turn out perfect furniture. We ought more properly to have said in the latter part of the nineteenth century, for perhaps nothing could be much An Old Cradle worse than the furniture of the earlier part, particu-lady here in our own land, for we had a mixture of the French, always bad, of the English, that was nondescript, and of the Puritans, that was — what shall we call it ? let it be nameless ; — we all know how it looked, and none would now care to use it. -The sumptuous furniture of old, is of itself sufficient to prove the truth of the statement which has been made as to the advances made during the period of wealth and luxury. One could not desire to see a more beautiful bedroom, for instance, than that in which James I. of England was accustomed to sleep during his visits to Knole, in Kent, and which is, to our minds, only the more attractive for a kind of grave stateliness that pervades the whole. The mothers of the present day may, perhaps, feel interested in knowing what kind of article a cradle was about three centuries ago; it was a species of box, or coffer on rockers, decorated elaborately with carvings. In later times French feeling crept into our furniture and, to our thinking, by no means improved it. -Illustrations of the elaborate and highly decorated character of the furniture belonging to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, are shown in our pages, from which our readers may derive some useful and suggestive hints from these reproductions. -There is, we know, of great power in this world, a certain fascinating spirit, called fashion; which controls the fancy, and compels it to a predilection, and, at -its pleasure, to a change of predilection, for forms and colors, and practices, quite independently of reason, and not seldom in the most direct opposition to commonsense. . -Fashion nevertheless is sometimes a brainless spirit, if the expression may be allowed of spirit; and without sense of good or evil. It will ally itself with taste, whether good or bad, and with moral order, good or bad. Among the Greeks of old, connecting itself with good taste (we wish we could add good morals) in its progress towards perfection, and maintaining the alliance, when perfection was attained. Fashion was of inestimable value. In some instances Fashion has been found capable of fixing a good moral order; and then of course it has been of worth still far more transcendant. But this brainless spirit, perhaps oftener has made bad taste immovable; of which the Chinese afford a great example. -But, among the Greeks, in architecture, in literature, even in dress, things were so settled, that one general character of Grecian taste has been the allowed criterion of perfection, for now about three thousand years. How was it that the spirit of fashion, among them, held such persevering connection with the spirits of common sence and good taste? Could it be because women were so excluded from general society as to have little influence in directing Fashion, or in supporting her in her wayward fancies? Surely the spirit of steadiness is not -alien from the English character : in graver matters we know it to be eminent. The famous \"Nolumus leges Angliae mutari,\" has been persevered in for centuries; and we may hope will be persevered in as long as the world shall last, or as long as it shall please providence that the English nation exist. But in matters of taste, certainly it has not been so. -There is not a demon more adverse to good taste than the spirit of Novelty. In matters of taste, as in almost everything, there are commonly many wrong ways for one right. Now the spirit of Novelty allows readily the passing from wrong to right ; but at no rate, the perseverance in right; whence wrong must, many times to one, with him, prevail. With this spirit, fashion has long, in this country, but especially of late days, held close alliance. Fashion has no will of her own ; but Novelty, though ever-changing, has, for the moment, a most determined one. Thus, Fashion still appearing the imperial lady, and Novelty but her minister, he easily leads her his own way. -In what high estimation both these whimsical spirits are held very extensively, net to say universally, among the ladies, is enough known. The ladies even in America rarely have their natural good taste improved, but often much perverted by education. Taught from infancy to revere the majesty of Fashion and to consider her sovereignty as not to be even decently opposed, with a living feeling for the charms of Novelty, they set -about their imperial business of furnishing a house. Ranging the fashionable upholsterers\\' warehouses, they feel themselves as in a sea of delights, but as in a vessel with a port to seek. Without a compass they look to Fashion as their polar star, their sails are filled by Novelty, and they give the helm to fancy. -The sky is clear, the weather most temperate; but under license of Fashion, Novelty, with his handmaid Variety, dispensing the winds, they are ever shifting. Fancy, distracted, grows giddy; her nerves falter, her hand shakes, her eyes twinkle, and she can no longer by day take the height of the sun, or by night with any certainty discover her polar star, a changeling polar star, Fashion. Thus distressed, the lady seeks advice from experience, and the cabinet-maker or upholsterer is called to her assistance. -Beyond all others the spirit of Novelty and Variety are objects of the upholsterer\\'s workshop. He professes infinite reverence for Fashion. But his loyalty is for the fashion that may happen to reign for the day : nor is it, like the Vicar of Bray\\'s, an ever acquiescing loyalty; on the contrary, he is ever aiming at revolution. The lady is aware of the unsteadiness of the reign of Fashion ; and not less anxious than the upholsterer to be prepared to adore the rising sun; but with this difference : he is always ready for revolution ; she devotes herself more to the present power, and dreads changes. in which others may be before her. Not wholly un-aware then of hazard in committing herself to his advice, having made her inquiries, and gained all attainable information, her purpose is to direct her upholsterer; but he is versed in the ways of leading her. -It behooves the cabinet-maker and upholsterer much to have talent in matters of taste, and to cultivate it so as to distinguish good from bad ; but more, it behooves him to know the weak points in human nature. Nothing so advantageous for him as to gain prevalence for a new fashion of very bad taste ; and the more grossly bad the surer and greater his benefit ; because the easier will be the task to bring about another change ; for of all things change is most beneficial to him. -The upholsterer\\'s interest then is in direct opposition to the architect\\'s credit. Put him into command in a room, and his first purpose must be to overwhelm the architect\\'s work. What are elegancies in stucco, stone, or marble to him? For daylight indeed he is a little dependent; he must have windows from the architect; and till stoves were brought into use he wanted him also for the chimney. But for candlelight, \"Give me a barn,\" he says, \"and I will so throw my many-folded drapery, suspended on my golden thyrsus-fashioned poles, that nothing shall be seen needing the architect\\'s art to supply.\" -To proceed with this subject, I will venture only to state a principle or two, which I trust you will admit, and I hope you will recommend to the ladies. When a -house is ready for the furnisherif it has any decoration of architecture fit to be seen, and not rather \\'deserving to be treated as the upholsterer, would\\' very properly treat the barn, the style of that decoration should be respected in the design of the furniture. Either all should be upholstery, or the upholstery should be subordinate to the architecture, and harmonize with it. Can it be requisite — I fear it may — to superadd, that the furniture should harmonize with itself through all its parts; that gaudy and ill assorted colors, awkward forms, and even elegant forms and foldings, in that kind of display which may deserve the epithet meretricious, however warranted by thefashion of the day, should be avoided. With what ideas do that nakedness of the female figure, and that abundant complexity, that mystery of folding, of the drapery about the room to receive such figures, as we have been accustomed to see, harmonize ? Fashion indeed is powerful, and sometimes grossly perverse. What could be reasonably done with the human head during the century and more of the successive fashions of the full bottomed wig, the aile-de-pigeon hair-dressing, and all that intervened and followed, till wigs and elaborate hair-dressing were both abolished ? Fashion, it must be confessed, has a strange power of fascination, which even strong minds have difficulty wholly to resist, even when that power is exerted most in opposition to evident reason. But it is only when a fashion has obtained universal and lasting prevalence that rea-son is so compelled to submit to it. Generally large choice is open. Reason and better taste may well venture upon opposition to partial and ephemeral absurdities, and, with due exertion, would prevent their gaining any overbearing ascendency. -The present rage for old articles of household use, table decoration, and personal adornment is a whim of fashion, in many instances the coveted articles having no element of propriety in our modern life. Very few of them are valuable in the light of sentiment, having no association with beloved friends or with historical events. -But apart f r om these considerations the love for genuine old relics of furniture, especially, has an excellent reason for its being. There are really valuable and useful articles of household economy which unreasoning style has relegated to the second-hand furniture store, to the attic, or to the barn, or perhaps ruthlessly destroyed, and which have been replaced by modern articles far inferior. The present spring seat sofa with its tufted cushions and tortoise back seat is not half so inviting and restful\\' as the old-fashioned, flat seated, broad sofa, long enough to receive a six-footer, and broad enough to hold him safely if sleep overtook him. Many of these articles are of solid w r ood with no suspicion of veneering, and their forms are really more elegant than those of to-day. Modern veneered and upholstered furniture requires repairing every few -years, or is worn beyond revamping within the recollection of a ten year old child. It is a source of regret that with the rage for antique furniture there is not also a demand for old time honesty in workmanship. In spite of the sneer against the old style straight backed chairs, most of the old style furniture was made for convenience. There never was a more convenient article of furniture than the old desk and drawers comA win e Cabinet bined — drawers below a folded-back desk, the back being pigeon holed, and the desk on hinges to be let down to form a writing shelf, and projecting far enough forward to give room for the writer\\'s knees. The cupboard was another useful article for the kitchen or dining room. It contained two or more wide drawers, with doors above them opening on shelves and racks, the whole standing on legs high enough to admit of sweeping under the cupboard. Memory recalls one, the framing and ends being of white walnut or hickory and the door panels and drawer fronts of cherry, both native woods, the creamy white of the hickory contrasting finely with the warm wine red of the cherry. These colors were set off by pendent pulls and door key escutcheon of polished ungilded brass that could be repolished and kept from the dilapidated appearance of -the warm gilded brass of the present. Such an article of furniture would give an air of substantial comfort to any modern home. -The inferiority of modern made furniture cannot properly be attributed to machine duplicated work ; it is as possible to make first class work by duplicating by machinery as by hand ; else our hand tools and machine tools would be much more costly than they are. But it is undeniable that most of the furniture made within the memory of the elderly portion of the present generation compares favorably with that now made, in durability and integrity of workmanship. In these qualities it would be well if our manufacturers shared in the rage for the antique. -Mediaeval furniture — Mobilia, as it is rightly styled — is one of the rarest manifestations of art-work or handicraft. Our knowledge of it is principally from pictures, illustrated MSS. and carvings. Contrary to the received opinion of some of the acknowledged authorities on Mediaeval art, we are convinced that there would be no difficulty in producing a very complete history of mobilia, the material for which could be drawn from the sources indicated. We see many modern specimens of both a bad and vitiated class of works, made at a time when splendid decoration reigned in place of art, and indeed no such thing as art existed. From this period we moderns have borrowed almost all our models, it being precisely the most unhappy choice we -could have made, not only on account of the amount of useless, expensive, and vulgar decoration it has led us into, but because the mere system of construction adopted is false, and so far, happily, insuring no lasting durability to the products of such workmanship. The furniture of every country has echoed in its form and decoration the character and spirit of the art then prevailing. In Egypt, of old, the tables, seats, couches, etc., preserved in the British Museum and other collections, testify to this; one or two things copied in bronze or marble from Greek works of this class, express exactly the same kind of thing, and point out by the extreme chastity of their forms, the peculiar idiosyncrasy of that nation, no less than by the skillful manner in which they are put together, the mechanical ability of the workman. Our knowledge of Roman doings in this matter is derived from similar sources. One or two examples of curule chairs that might have belonged to Pro-Consuls of Gaul or elsewhere, do indeed remain, with strange legends attached to them, and saints and monarchs of very questionable verity or appropriateness. Upon Pompeian pictures, bronzes, etc., we must rely, without which we should be more ignorant of these things than of the seemingly much more perishable and fragile manufactures in glass and earthenware, or even iron, of which such innumerable specimens exist. We have as many remains of Assyria as of old Rome. There is no doubt from the gorgeous illuminations of the -period of the lower Empire, that the furniture then in use was, characteristically wrought, of extraordinary splendour, gilded, incrusted, and inlaid with ivory and jewels to a degree that quite marred its artistic beauty. Of this, much purified by Italian taste, some slight -traces are to be found in the Venetian works, affected as they were in this, as in other things, by oriental neighborhood and associations. The Venetians improved these works, be it understood, and chastened, while they truly enriched the tawdry over decoration of the Greeks.. Their conquest in the islands and commercial seats in so many parts of the Byzantine Empire, brought them in contact with more than one point of its character. Of constructional felicity there is almost none in Byzantine examples of which we have knowledge. -In Europe, in the middle ages, the character of mobilia was ever that of current architecture, then the art to which all the other major as well as minor arts were subordinated, — that fact of their subordination being one to be ever most needfully borne in mind by the student of archaeological science and mediaeval art. We find this leading fact constantly forgotten by writers on the arts. To furniture particularly, painting became serviceable, the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries never missing an opportunity of employing that art in this way. Hence, several painters began life as decorators, as many more were sculptors who began as goldsmiths. Marquetry was another most effective means of decoration, becoming estimable from an early period of these epochs by the careful method of its execution, and, later, from the fine forms and colors its patterns displayed. In the sixteenth century much beautiful work was produced, its early decades being, indeed, to be regarded as the culminating period in furniture designing. Colors due to the above means, or rich velvets and silks, brocaded or woven with gold thread, took precedence in characteristic ornamentation at a somewhat late portion of this era. But carving, as so many French and German works testify, was largely employed. Both these characters ran into ruinous riot in the next epoch, and lavish magnificence took the place of beautiful design, the use of things themselves becoming hidden under a desire to waste all the -costliness and folly of extravagant ornamentation upon them. At this time began the still existing mania for furniture made for show ; and to be shut up in a room, wastefully decorated with merely costly ornaments, intended to be seen only, and but sparingly brought into use. It was the \"bright poker\" idea at its maddest. Hence we now find reception rooms that were too fine for use, and frail furniture neither man nor woman dared to intrust their persons upon. More sumptuosity and ridiculous degradation of taste burst out under Louis XIV., when those preposterously tawdry gewgaws that are to be seen here and there in sale rooms, when some old household is broken up, overloaded with tortoise shell, brass, sham jewelry, and vile carvings, and generally made to imitate something that had not the remotest resemblance to the real nature of article in question, but preferably that farthest from it. Thus a cabinet or \"armoire\" faced the world with an extravagant architectural frontage, and a chest of drawers was a miniature frontage. As was to be expected from the political state of the time, the most hideous of these monFigure 58 strosities came, not from -France, where the taste for these originated, but from servile Germany, whose craftsmen vied with each other in the cities of Nuremburg, Augsburg, and Dres-den, as to who should make the most monstrous foolery at the most wasteful cost. Italy, as usual, before her utter degradation kept to the fashions of an earlier date or improved by her native gift of taste, upon that current in such a manner that something of her old inheritance is seen even at this time. -Later in the seventeenth century especially, this whimsicality took a new bent, and a queer hothouse sort of life, a meretricious vitality, such as disease often has, broke out, and the Louis XV. fashion got into vogue, when oddly shaped forms, mouldings and inlays were employed, and flat surfaces bore the works of men\\'s lives — not of their minds, but of their patient dull drudgery at outre and elaborate combinations of art — necessarily, therefore, devoid of real taste and common sense. Incrustations of brass, copper, tin, and even silver were engraved by the burin to imitate relief or actual mouldings. Wreaths, termed masks — not the pretty Amorini of an earlier age — were attached to the articles, their office being almost invariably to hide some dishonesty of construction or to give a curve to some weak angle or strengthen some spindling line, to the eye at least, but not in fact. Indeed it is notably a marked characteristic of this class of works that all their tendencies are to be willfully false. One sees at once that the craftsman does not err in ignorance of the demands of his duty because things which might, constructionallv employed, give real strength when needed, although of -a supplementary sort, willfully give only the look of strength, and, as if by malicious intention to lie for lying\\'s sake, neglect their duty when it \\\\yere easier to do it honestly than to fail or neglect. Thus it is in the major art of that time; thus it was in life, among the leaders, at least; thus it was upon everything that lies upon the surface of that rotten era, that nothing but the fiery ruin of revolution could purge pure. -Mere costliness is no element of art or good taste. We have seen very handsome chairs sold at a price that would condemn them in the eyes of untrained wealth, just as we have seen on the tea-table of the poor and lowly, low cost china that would put to blush — if it was possible — much of the high priced porcelain that decorates the cabinets of the wealthy. -The perfecting of many processes of manufacture has placed at the disposal of artists and ornamental designers means for the reproduction and multiplication of their works, of which they have not been slow to avail themselves. As a class they undoubtedly occupy more definitely the position of leaders or teachers ; and we are fairly entitled to hope that by this teaching the standard of public taste has been raised. The soil to be cultivated is rank with weeds, and the intelligent laborers are few. Our manufactures are in advance of our taste. The conditions of art and manufacture in the Middle Ages are in our day reversed : then there was a Raphael to design, but no Minton to reproduce skillfully -and at a cheap rate the pattern example ; now we have the power of cheap reproduction, but not many designs worth reproducing; so we wisely store our museums with all the best examples of human invention, and thus provide ourselves at once with a standard, and with a check upon any vain ideas we may be disposed to entertain of our intellectual superiority and advanced taste. -Never in the world\\'s history were the means of spreading a taste for art among the people as abundant. The productions of our manufacturers are placed before us with cheapness and certainty, and where bad taste in designs is to be noted, the fault can hardly be laid at the door of the producer, who, in many cases failing to secure the services of an original or even capable designer, is driven to pander to a taste which he would willingly enough direct if he could. We have so-called schools of design, instituted expressly to provide our manufacturers with intelligent designers; and we are able, by means of lithographic printing and photo engraving, to distribute cheaply and make common property throughout the length and breadth of the land the finest examples of all good art, in whatever form it may have appeared. Yet, after all, in the comprehension of good design, in appreciation of beautiful form, in sentiment of color, we are but a barbarous people as compared with any Eastern nation, or with our own Gothic ancestors. The best that can be said of us is -that we feel our inferiority when we look at an Indian shawl, at a Moorish pitcher, a Persian rug, or a Chinese vase. We try unsuccessfully to reproduce them ; we do actually reproduce the ceramic ware of the 16th century, and glory in it; while we vainly strive to copy the mediaeval stained-glass windows, and are driven to confess that a people who flourished before the foundation of Rome were capable of designing a gold setting for a brooch which puts all our barbarous efforts to shame. -The spread of art is one thing; the advance is another. With our eyes open, it would be vain to deny that throughout the kingdom a new taste has arisen, and a desire among all classes of the people to appropriate some form of art is evident. But taste implies only accuracy of judgment, not that power of execution which follows in its wake. The taste of the man who knows is not that of the man who does. -The first-named may be considered as a bon vivant, who is fond of the dishes before him, and distinguishes nicely what is savoury and delicious, or flat and insipid in the ingredients of each ; while the second may be regarded as the cook, who, from knowing what things will mix well together, and distinguishing by a nice taste, when he has arrived at that happy result, is able to compose such exquisite mixtures. -In the construction and ornamentation of furniture, as of buildings, grounds, clothing, and of everything\" -else of a material character, external to ourselves, several things are to be considered in their relation to our needs, comfort, and enjoyment. The mere necessaries of life are really very few, though even these may be multiplied by habit, education, and circumstance. The man of thorough culture and high civilization certainly needs many things which the savage can do without and which would be even an incumbrance to him. But if these, increased in number as they are by artificial circumstances, are fully supplied, we are not, and ought not to be, satisfied. We may and should consider what is adapted to promote our comfort and gratify our taste, ministering appropriately, in both directions, to our enjoyment. For our present purpose and in connection with cabinet and upholstery work, it will be sufficient to consider three things — Novelty, Taste and Utility. -i. Novelty. — This is always a source of pleasure, affording a healthful excitement to the mind. This is the reason of the frequently sudden and extreme changes in fashion, of the desire to visit localities and scenes which are new and strange to us, and of the effort to secure for the gratification of all the senses ever new means of pleasure and excitement. The conservative critic may find fault with this universal tendency to innovation, but it will excite and exert its influence so long as the human mind tires of sameness, and seeks for change. We desire repose and permanency of con-ditions and surroundings only when we have ceased to acquire and develop, and our powers have begun to decline with the coming on of old age. This quality of novelty is one which all who would cater for the popular taste and, by so doing, secure and maintain a successful business, must aim at in connection with other qualities of excellence. It is also unquestionably true that the desire and effort for novelty leads sometimes to the adoption of styles and ornaments which are unsymmetrical and incongruous, and though striking and sometimes even almost pleasing to those who crave that which is startling and outre, they will greatly offend good taste. There are certain established principles which are the basis of all correct procedure, and any rule of mechanical practice, or even what has come to be an established custom may be departed from or neglected, so that there is no infringement of these fixed principles, among which may be named fitness, utility, propriety. If, in seeking novelty, the artist-mechanic introduces that which is in violation of the principles of unity and harmony, he will forfeit his claim to be called in any sense an artist. Let him rather search for the union of novelty with other beauties, with a constant consideration of a reference to fundamental principles., and to this end it will be well that he should thoroughly study the details of the works of ancient art, whether of the Gothic and other mediaeval styles, or of the more remote classical. From these may be gathered -suggestions which, by exact reproduction or suitable combination, will afford designs, which may be applied to modern uses with excellent effect for internal finishing and furniture. -2. We consider, in the next place, the element of Taste in construction and ornamentation. It has been well said that \"art can lend to an object a value, greater than that of the material and workmanship of which it consists, even when the object is formed of precious materials, as of rare marbles, scarce woods, or \\'silver or gold/ \\' And, where the material is of less intrinsic value, yet more will depend on art and the taste displayed in figure and ornament. The beautiful, the tasteful has a commercial value — a remark as true of the goods named in the opening sentence of this article, as of those in any line of manufacture. It follows, then, that the manufacturer, who can in the highest degree secure that the productions of his establishment shall be in the greatest degree tasteful, and worthy to be styled beautiful, will in this fact secure no mean advantage in the busy arena of competition. Expenditure in the employment of designers who shall be true artists, even though it may seem hardly necessary or profitable, may prove to be really wise in principle, and most satisfactory in results. The workman also may, with great benefit to himself, study these works thus greatly enhancing the value of his labor, and become more than a mechanic, for he that can, in a novel form or one that -is original with himself, form a chair or a table, which, either as a whole or in its details, is really tasteful — \"a thing of beauty\" — is truly an artist. If he has the laudable ambition in this manner to rise above his fellows, let him acquaint himself with the laws of beauty, so that he shall be able at once to see the difference, and the reason of it, between the beautiful and the ugly, the graceful and the deformed, the refined and the coarse. Let him study the works of art of all ages, in the great variety of subjects to which art has been applied, and he will not only have opened to him new and most fruitful sources of pleasures, but will add, to mere skill in the use of tools, the development of a talent that shall command its price. -3. The other point which we proposed to consider was — Utility. This may appear to be independent in some measure of the considerations before named, yet a manifest adaptation to the purpose for which it is designed will be an element in the decision of the question whether it is tasteful or not. Such is the constitution of the human mind that what might, aside from any consideration of its use, seem to be without form or comeliness, assumes a certain appearance of beauty, when it seems to be precisely fitted to the convenience of the user. It is also clear that the purpose for which an object is intended should be met in its structure and form, and no adjunct, for the sake merely of decoration, should be permitted to interfere with its utility, or be -inconsistent with the position which it occupies in relation to the whole subject or article. The material should be studied with its adaptability to those forms -which are essential to the use of the article which is to be manufactured. It should not be assumed that, because certain forms and decorations may be appropriate to one material, they would be equally adapted to, and look equally well in, another material entirely different in its character. One of the essentials of a good design -in industrial art is the adaptation of the natural characteristics of the materials in which the design is to be realized. The form, also, must in every case subserve the purpose for which the article is to be made, the lines being as graceful and as true in the relative proportions of the parts as will be consistent with the convenience of the person who may use the article. When, however, the objection is made to a chair or to a lounge that one cannot sit or rest easily and comfortably upon it, it is not a sufficient answer that the form of the one is graceful and all its lines those of beauty, and that the other is tasteful in design, and that in material and covering there is harmony both of proportions and of colors. They are articles not to be looked at — not that merely or chiefly — but to be used, and in their very form should be suggestive of rest, refreshment, repose. Other illustrations might be given of this point ; these, however, will suffice to illustrate the position that, whenever utility is sacrificed to novelty or to ornamental appearance, however pretty, the article is badly designed, and the art or skill exercised upon it has been practically thrown away. -Words are more or less indefinite in their meaning, and admit of wider and more comprehensive translation, according to their context with other words, or their association with ideas previously existing in the minds of their hearers. Among them all, there are perhaps none more difficult to explain than the word style, -by Webster, we shall find how large is its range, how wide its divergence from any center that can be marked out for it. Walker puts among other things as its signification \"manner of writing,\" with regard to language; manner of speaking, appropriate to particular character ; title, appellation. All this may be right ; at any rate is enough for him who is not required to go into lengthy definitions, but merely to throw out such suggestions as will, when united with others, be the seed of future comprehension. -I think we may acknowledge style to be the instrument of power by which we convey emphasis of expression in our work, and render intelligible forms which would otherwise be both meaningless and purposeless. There is another word which artists are in the habit of associating, and even confusing with style, Manner, which when repeated again and again is designated as mannerism, a feature by which we are too often enabled to distinguish the productions of one man, and even of one age, from those of another; but there is a wide difference between it and style. Style advances whatever it is attached to, makes its intentions more evident, increases the force of its expression, as well as frees it from impurities which in no way help the object it has in view ; while manner, or mannerism, on the contrary, serves no good purpose, is, in fact, most frequently merely the mirror in which the artist, or may be the period at which he lived, is unconsciously reflected. -That style and manner are frequently so mingled one with another as to render it difficult to separate them, or to distinguish which is which, I will confess; but the simple text I have here put to you will, I think, if carefully attended to, though perhaps not serving as an exact definition, show what is style and what is not, and even tell in what proportion mannerism, if any, is introduced. -This question the student will do well to constantly consider, as it tends to elevate what he may send forth, and keep it free from much that is detrimental to excellence, though at the same time highly seductive to the young mind. I wish to be the more impressive in this advice, because I cannot help fancying that at this moment there is a more than usual quantity of mannerism passing for style in the world of Art, and that students are mistaking one for the other, and running after the wrong thing, by affecting peculiarities and imitating weaknesses belonging to past ages, and quite out of place in the present day. I am not saying this in any invidious spirit; on the contrary, I am ready to acknowledge that many fine works are put forth among us, that carry out with powerful emphasis the spirit that is within them, simply because the treatment of every part is in unison with that spirit, and serves to elucidate the meaning intended by the sculptor ; but the weed of mannerism is growing at the same time among us — mannerism, I fancy, not derived even from the best -Style is the gold that is the mark of genius, and mannerism the color by which you distinguish from whence it comes. All that relates to style is derived from the most profound knowledge. -With some style implies simple excellence of treatment in contradiction to the absence of that quality, and they read it as a mannerism always the same, and equally applicable to the carrying out in Art of all subjects — they talk of a Classical style and think this is the only adjunct that can properly be attached to it. There are other meanings to the word than this, or rather its meaning is capable of great extension. There is the Severe style, perhaps pretty much, though not quite the same thing as the Classical; then there is the Gothic style, which, clinging to a certain extent to the Classical, has its own peculiar mode of expression. Then, again, the simple and the Florid styles, which, it is not too much to say, are directly opposed to each other; and the Domestic style, which contradicts and entirely sets at defiance the Classical ; and we might even add to them the Grotesque style, which hardly claims relationship with any of them. We will endeavour to explain the difference between them and the requirements of each. -The classical style would be the line we should adopt in our work when the subject to be treated belongs to -the classical days of old — when it associates itself with the grand old bards whose distant footsteps echo through the corridors of time, or whose conceptions are of that lofty nature that they admit of no minute detail, or dwelling on petty things. Our illustrations of them should then be in the same style, severe and simple, not -like everyday Nature, but like a something which we all of us, more or less, endeavour to conceive, and even long to be about us; but which can only exist ideally within ourselves, more or less clear, according as we are capable of entering into the feeling of the poet, or of becoming part of it ourselves. -The error modern imitators of Greek Art generally commit is exaggerating the tendency to straight lines and the repetition of them. -The Gothic style, as we have said before, retains some connection with the Classic by preserving its quiet -simplicity as well as its grace of line. That it has much of mannerism cannot be denied, arising, often from the mistake of the workers in it, who have fancied that rudeness and exaggeration of form necessarily belonged to it. This peculiarity, however, appertains only to the more decayed periods, and not to the time when it rose into beauty and fine art, as in the 13th century. That it had then and has now a style of its own is certain, for it had to express and does express the tone and feeling of a religion quite distinct from that of the Greeks — less earthly or sensuous, more pure and ethereal, more divine. We are now speaking, of course, of monumental and religious Art, the only things in which the Gothic is appropriate. In a domestic or homely sphere it always appears to be out of place and unsuited to the purpose. -The Gothics were greater architects than the Greeks, in a way, but it would be idle to assert that they were as good sculptors; there is no reason, however, why the finest works should not be combined with the Gothic style, for they can be made quite compatible with it. -Even the Florid style, which, from our dislike to it as somewhat debasing Art, we feel much inclined to stigmatize with the title of mannerism, is sometimes admissible ; in fact, must be acknowledge to be, under some circumstances, the most appropriate — for instance in the decoration of the theatre, the ball-room, and other places of amusement. Surely when so placed it is -more in unison than any other with that elevation of the spirits which is supposed to pervade the scene. -The severe, unaffected Classical style would be a damper on our enjoyment under such circumstances, when we are not looking coldly on at real life, but taking, so to speak, a glance at it through a colored glass or our imagination. -Shakespeare, in his poetic drama of \"The Tempest,\" seems to give us a view of it in this florid style. He elevates by his poetical imagination the scenes he portrays, and so leads us away into a realm of ideality more florid, more enjoyable than the reality we are compelled every day to take part in. You must do the same with your art, or at any rate furnish your portion in that enjoyment, and you will do it best by bending it to the same feeling. -It is under such influences that high and ornamental sculpture most frequently join hands together, and are present, not as real personages, or as representatives of particular ideas, but as decorations of a scene created for the transient pleasure of the moment. Your lines may now flow with greater freedom, your figures perform their parts with less reserve than on other occasions, your style may in short be florid. It is here, if anywhere, that color may be introduced into your statues, as well as into the ornaments about them. The danger is of their becoming sensuous; but the refinement, whether of design or execution, which you will -introduce, will keep that down in the same way as the great dramatist has done in the fairy tale I have just alluded to. There are scenes and characters in that which connect it with the lower features of humanity, and so preserve a relationship to the real, which no imaginative work, whether of Art or Literature, should be entirely without ; whilst there are others, the creation of poetic fancy, which serve to lift us upwards into the realms of ideality; and make us the better for the enjoyment we receive. You will say we are soaring into the region of rhodomontade and losing the practical; but we may tell you that you need not feel yourself so strictly bound by rule in this style as in the others ; your forms are not required to be so true to the modesty of Nature as they are generally ; they may be made more elective by a departure from truth, or at any rate an exaggeration of fact. With those proportions which Nature has given to different objects of her creation you may deal freely, altering them to suit your own ; _ k rposes of expression or effect. We will put before you Cellini, as the highest example in this walk of Art. Strictly speaking he is an ornamentalist ; but he sometimes attempts high Art, where there is often with him a lack of correct proportion — for instance, in his statue of Perseus, where the over ornamentation hardly hides from a practical eye the want of proper balance of parts. Sometimes, indeed, in his metal works he uses his freedom as a license which serves the stvle to which his -work belongs, and so answers the purpose he has in view ; he is rarely, if ever, quite natural, though always florid in his style, and always effective. -It will be impossible in a work of this kind, to write at length on the various styles, so we will content ourselves with touching on some of those styles which seem to have been much in favor at certain periods. To go into this matter extensively would require several volumes of greater dimensions than the present one. -As with all the arts, crafts and sciences, we get all our glimmerings from, or through the Egyptians, so everything pertaining to the earliest examples of furniture come to us from that source. -Many people imagine that the habit of sitting down, as practiced in this country and Europe, is a universal human habit, old as the race itself, and in no way associated with civilization. Investigations, however, have shown that the habit is acquired, and marks the highest notch of civilization and advancement ; indeed, it is estimated that not more than 10 per cent of the human family practice sitting on the civilized plan. -Men who do not sit have two attitudes for resting; women use one of their own. Squatting on the heel is favored in India and China. In this position the weight of the body falls upon the toes, and to keep the balance comfortably the arms must hang over the knees, the hands dangling. The cross-legged attitude is general from Siam eastward, through the Malay countries. In -the jungle men crouch, the knees raised, the arms folded over them and the chin resting on the arm. The women -of that region rest upon the floor sideways, thus throwing the weight on the outer part of one thigh, not a very comfortable posture to a civilized Caucasian., -As civilization advanced in Egypt the use of furniture became more and more necessary. First the rulers began with thrones and seats of honor for the kings and nobles; then the rich merchants followed, providing themselves with furniture less costly, perhaps, but equally as useful as that owned and used by State officials. The working classes and the poor were doubtless content to sit down on their mats of papyri stalks, under the shelter of their rough cabins of mud. The rich of the dynasties, dating from the twelfth to the thirtieth, furnished their houses with very costly furniture, which consisted principally of rich beds, or couches with their beds, or mattresses, pillows and cushions, and wooden head-rests, footstool stands, tables and chairs, both with high and low back; or folding stools, like the Greek okladias, boxes or chests for holding clothes and other objects. From the earliest period high-backed and other chairs were in use, and at the time of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties were imported as tribute from Ethiopia. Pillows of stone, wood and other objects were also of great antiquity, and are represented in coffins of the sixth and following dynasties. They exhibit a great variety of shape, consisting of a curved semi-elliptical portion, adapted to hold the back of the head, supported by a column or other contrivance resting on a base or pedestal. For furniture, various woods were employed — ebony, acacia or soft cedar, sycamore and others of species not determined; ivory, both of -the hippopotamus and the elephant, and used for inlaying, as also were glass pastes, and specimens of marquetry are not uncommon. In the paintings in the tombs gorgeous pieces of gilded furniture are depicted. For cushions and mattresses, linen cloth, feathers of water fowl and colored stuffs appear, to have been used, while seats have plaited bottoms of linen cord or tanned and dyed leather thrown over them. Sometimes the skins of panthers were used for the purpose. On the whole an Egyptian house was lightly furnished and not encumbered with so many articles as are in use at the present day. For carpets they used mats of plain fiber, on which children and servants sat, or rather squatted. -The chest shown at Fig. 58 seems to have been a very popular piece of furniture, as numbers are found depicted on the tombs and monuments. The bedstead and ivory headrest shown in Fig. 59 were also common articles of furniture with the rulers and with the rich, and many of them were finely upholstered with handsome and costly fabrics. -The fragments of a chair shown in Fig. 60 — are still in existence, and preserved in the British Museum, and show the remains of the veritable chair used as a throne by Queen Hatasu, a royal lady who made things lively for a while in the valley of the Nile some 1600 years before Christ and twenty-nine years before Moses. This is, so far as we know, the most venerable piece of wooden furniture in the world. There is in the Louvre, -France, a metal chair, decorated and incrusted with mosaics, that is older by 400 years than the one exhibited. Hatasu\\'s chair or throne, or rather what remains of it — as it is in a dilapidated condition and has to be secured with brass bands — is made of what appears to be lignum-vitse, is of a dark color, like cocus wood, and is inlaid over all the carved portions with gold plates. The two sacred serpents, shown on the two uprights at the back, however, are not treated so, but, as the detail illustrates, with little silver rings sunk all over them ; probably a conventional rendering of the snake skin. -The five articles of furniture exhibited in the group, Fig. 61, showing a stool, stand for a vase, workman\\'s stool, head-rest and vase on a stand, are from photos of the originals in the British Museum. They are Egyptian examples and are more than 3000 years old. Nothing can be more suitable for its purpose than the \"workman\\'s stool.\" The seat is precisely like that of a modern kitchen chair (all wood), slightly concaved to promote the sitter\\'s comfort, and supported by three legs curving outwards. This is simple, convenient and admirably adapted to long service. Besides these examples, there are jn the museum several seats formed with cross legs on the principle of our common campstool, and all are well made and have the lower parts of their legs carved as heads of geese, with inlayings of -There are in the various museums many articles of luxury and comfort taken from Egyptian tombs, which demonstrate the extraordinary state of civilization and culture attained by these ancient people, that aid us in forming a picture of their domestic habits. Boxes, chests, tables and shelves in great variety have been unearthed, \"some inlaid with various woods and with little squares of bright turquoise blue pottery let in as a relief; others veneered with ivory; wooden spoons carved in most intricate designs, of which one, representing a girl among lotus flowers, is a work of great artistic skill; boats of wood, head-rests and carved models of parts of houses and granaries, together with writing materials, different kinds of tools and implements and quantities of personal ornaments and requisites.\" -Indeed the more we know of the Egyptians the more w r e are led to believe that long before Greece or Rome were known they enjoyed a remarkably high state of civilization and learning, with all their accompanying advantages. -A figure given (in group) exhibit two very old chairs and a couple of Egyptian chairmakers at work, with some of the tools and materials scattered about on the floor. Here we see a square, a couple of adzes, and a drill in the hands of one of the workmen, who is bor-ing a hole in the chair by using a bow to turn the drill. These tools are very much like the tools in use today. Several finished chair legs are seen on the wall. This carving on the walls of a tomb, was executed between two and three thousand years ago. -Furniture used by the Chaldeans, the Assyrians, Babylonians, Hebrews and other old nations, was of similar type to the Egyptian, as may be seen by referring to a number of illustrations shown, also examples of Greek and Roman furniture are given. -Some of the chairs shown are fine examples, and both are constructed on Egyptian and other lines. Later styles, or rather examples of later styles, are shown in Figs. 19, 20, the coronation chair, 28, and others shown in the first chapter. -The Gothic style in furniture began during the reign of Louis VIII, and St. Louis (Louis IX) — 1223-1270; the style growing out of the Byzantine style of Architecture, and was introduced by the artists and craftsmen brought to France from Constantinople by the returning crusaders. -The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries had been remarkable for a general development of commerce ; merchants had traded extensively with the East, and had grown opulent, and their homes naturally displayed signs of wealth and comfort that in former times had been impossible to any but princes and rich nobles. -quarters a taste for high and rich colorings and we have the testimony of an old writer who describes the interior of the Hotel de Beheme, which, after being the residence of several great personages, was given by Charles VI. in 1388 to his brother the Duke of Orleans. \"In this palace was a room used by the Duke, hung with cloth of gold, embroidered with windmills. There were besides rich carpets with gold flowers, cushions of cloth of gold, and summer carpets of Arragon leather.\" -As we approach the end of the fourteenth century we find canopies added to the \"chairs,\" which were carved in oak and chestnut and sometimes elaborately gilded and picked out in color. The canopied seats were bulky and throne-like constructions, and were abandoned toward the end of the fifteenth century, for a somewhat smaller and less massive seat. -The high-backed chair shown in Fig. 62 is a sample of this style. Chairs, tables, beds and fittings were all made in this style and the interiors were rich in carvings, massive but stiff and informal. Plate I, exhibits a chamber in this style of the period of Louis XI, which shows a bed and several pieces of furniture. Fig. 63 shows a German chamber of a somewhat later date. The French carved bed with canopy, Fig. 64, is of the period of Louis XIV. It is an example that was much followed, and the fashion lasted well into the period of Louis the XVI. A gradual change in French furniture took place during the reign of Louis XVI, and the orna-mentation assumed the style as shown in Plate II. French furniture was continually changing in style, and we have early and late French, Louis Seize, and Empire styles, each of these having their changes, imitations and modifications. -Gilt wood, Chinese lacquers and their imitations by means of the varnish to which Robert Martin gave his name, are the preferred materials. Bronze mountings, set in the panels, and cut out in highly elaborate patterns, decorate the cabinets of Cafneri. The marquetry work of Boulle, made to conform with the prevailing style is continued by the heirs of the celebrated workman. -The ornamentation that is peculiar to the style of Louis XV. modifies the old elements and introduces new ones. A narrow but very much lengthened acanthus takes the place of the rich and broad acanthus of the Louis XIV. -This new form becomes associated with shells, rocaille, perforated stones. The development of the natural science, interest in which is manifested by the gathering of collections of shells, etc., has a share, together with the popularity of Dresden China, in bringing about the triumph of the style rocaille. -An interior of the style Louis XV. also includes the decorative Chinese fancies, the carved elephants of Caffieri\\'s clocks; \\'then the characters of Italian comedy, reminiscences of Watteau, and the little love sports met -with pretty much everywhere, in Tapestry, ceramic jewelry, snuff-boxes, bon-bonnieres, fans, transom panels, screens, and the many quaint and curious fancies peculiar to that era. -The cabinets, Figs. 65 and 66, and carved walnut bed, Fig. 67, of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are good examples of the work of those periods and offer many suggestions to designers, carvers and workmen. The bed shown in Fig. 68, was used by Pope Pius VII, at Fontainbleau, and is rich in decoration and costly drapery. -Plate III shows a whole series of details in Louis Seize style, from which the cabinet-maker may garner -many good things for nearly all purposes. Fig. 69 shows a cabinet in this style which is elaborately finished and decorated with gold. It is a thing of beauty -and was purchased for the museum at a cost of $7,500. The table shown at Fig. 70 is a fine specimen of the style Louis Seize and is beautifully carved. Fig. 71 shows a good old-fashioned commode ornamented lavishly with gilt, bronze and inlay ; the Louis Seize chairs illustrated in Fig. 72 are good examples of the period. They are finished in blue and gold and are very dainty pieces of furniture. These illustrations are drawn from photos of the originals now in the Cluny museum. A most beautiful piece of work is a little ebony cabinet, Fig. J2> — now m tne Kensington museum, which was made by the celebrated French cabinet-maker, Boulle. It is beautifully inlaid in the most exquisite designs and made nearly two hundred years ago. -Boulle, not to mention many others of the earlier period, was an artist ; he conceived his own designs, he drew them out (the patent is given him in his name not only as a cabinet-maker, but as an architect and sculptor), he executed everything with his own hands; he was a chaser, engraver, and gilder ; he was, as we see, a man of cultivated tastes into the bargain.\" When we add to his merit as a designer, and a delicate appreciator of the work of others, his merit as a good workman whose productions, without need of repair, are as stout in the present day, after two hundred years of use as they were the day they were made, it may be fairly conceded, even by the sternest rigorist, that Andre Boulle worked in what is understood as\\' the true spirit. Not -only in its construction, but in every feature, in the choice of the materials, in the chasing and gilding and the marquetry, his work will be found to be of the most honest kind, very different to the modern rubbish that passes under the name, where false tortoise shell, made of horn or gelatine ; false mother-of-pearl, box or horn instead of ivory ; brass or even zinc lacquered ornament tacked on to the ill-made joinery usurp the place of true work, whose only fault was that it was produced in a period when the traditions of art were on the decline. When Boulle used wood it was ebony, which the cabinet makers, his successors, on the plea of its difficulty in working, in taking the glue or varnish — Boulle never used varnish — and other reasons, replaced with stained pear-wood. In the choice of his woods Boulle showed the extremest care, and one of his severest blows was his loss, by the fire that destroyed his collection of prints, of a qauntity of rare woods which he had, we learn from the inventory he made at the time, long stored by to season. The bronze he used was honestly chiselled and chased and gilt, not lacquered, and each ornament was a design not stamped out. -The secrets of Boulle\\'s skill may be said to have died with their inventor, for though the traditions were continued, the sobriety and the grandiose style of the master will be found to be sadly wanting in all the work of his imitators. So much was this recognized that, throughout the last century, in all the sale catalogues the works -by Boulle himself are conspicuously marked, more than one collector made it his specialty to gather specimens of the great cabinet maker\\'s work. -Boulle died at the age of eighty-two (February 29, 1732) at his house in the Louvre, and was buried in the -neighboring church of Saint Germain L\\'Auxerrois, leaving two sons to combine, only in name it is true, the traditions which he had in a measure positively created. One of the sons, employed at the Sevres manufactory, was, it would appear, the first to introduce, in the decoration of furniture, the use of porcelain. -Plate IV shows a couple of tables of the style of Louis XVI, which contain a number of very useful suggestions, suggestions that will be utilized in the manu-During the Marie Antoinette period, the most extravagant furniture was made and the most extravagant -prices were paid for it, and some very handsome specimens were turned out. The little writing table shown in Fig. 74, was specially designed and made for the Queen, and cost a very large sum of money. This table is now in England and was bought some years ago for $37,000, an enormous amount of money for so small a piece of furniture. An English writer who was at the sale, in speaking of it, says : \"It amused me to notice -that it required a special attendant to guard this little specimen, so many were crowding round to inspect it. -It was literally mobbed as I tried to get a glimpse of it for my note book, and the adjectives showered upon 1; by the upper ten were the most expressive I have ever heard applied to furniture. It was oblong in shape, with a drawer fitted with inkstand, writing-slide, and shelf beneath an oval medallion of a trophy, and flowers on the top, and trophies with four medallions round the -sides. This was stamped J. Riesner, and branded underneath with cypher of Marie Antoinette and Garde Meuble de la Reine. This really beautiful article of fur-niture was exhibited in 1862 at the South Kensington Loan Exhibition. Three thousand guineas was the first bid for it, but it soon ran up to 4,500 guineas, at which price some dispute arose as to whose bid it was. This was settled by $25,000 being offered, and the bidding continued till the price reached $30,500, when, amid much applause, it became the property of Mr. Wer-theimer. I anticipated that this little gem would realize a large sum, but the amount obtained for it is certainly fabulous. I can say, however, that the beauty of the workmanship must be seen to be believed.\" -Fig. 75 illustrates a bed introduced by Queen Marie Antoinette. This bed became quite popular for a time, but ran out of vogue during the revolution after which the Empire Style was introduced, when beds were specially designed for warriors, judges, statesmen and successful leaders; many of the beds were heaps of silly ornament and cumberous and rich draperies. This phase of the Empire style did not last long, however, but gave place to a more sensible practice of construction and ornamentation. The two Plates, V and VI, show details and ornamentation in the better days of the Empire style. Plate V showing some of the best examples of the period. -The French revolution brought with it many good things — as well as bad, and it was really a blessing in disguise in many ways inasmuch as it cleared the way for better things among which may be mentioned the Empire style as represented in the illustrations and Plates shown herewith. -Among the many decorations in this style, quivers, torches, and armorial trophies were freely made use of, and this tendency to make ornament subservient to the general form, of which it should always be only the complement and accessory, so far from diminishing in -the next age, became accentuated, as the following illustrations of \"Empire\" will demonstrate. It had forced itself into fashion, and opened up fresh fields -and pastures new for the courageous decorator. Its promoters had gone to draw inspiration from the philosophical world of antiquity, and they studiously attempted to revive antique rules, traditions and customs, many of which were inconsistent with modern life. The broad-backed chair (Fig. 76) makes a fine looking, comfortable seat. Cleverly hollowed out to catch the back and support the shoulders, it proffers the acme of comfort, without, at the same time, being stuffy. -Passing to Fig. yy, we find a form of couch which was at one time very popular in this country. It reminds one of the old \"high-low\" designs which used to be the fashion in the \"early fifties,\" and there is no doubt that this choice of a resting pad proves a comfort to the sitter who is dainty in the matter of position. -This design, which is without a back, is evidently for use rather than display. Before passing from this design we cannot help noticing the increased opportunities which it gives to the chair or settee frame maker, as he has been too much in the habit of hiding his work with ostentatious upholstery. The small table (Fig. 78) is for decorative rather than useful purposes. The design, if well executed, adds unusual classic dignity to the center of a room, or as a choice corner-piece. This belongs to the class erstwhile known as the \"loo\" table, and has been in the background of late years. It is -still in vogue in its larger forms as a dining-table, and those who still possess one will enthusiastically tell you that for a small dinner party there is nothing compar-able with our circular friend. The outward bend and consequent placing of one\\'s neighbors right and left, in a position where conversation is enjoyable, renders the round table unrivalled for the party of six or eight. -There is a sturdiness about German furniture, that does not obtain in French or in the furniture of other Latin races, as may be seen in the examples shown on Plate VII, where five pieces of German Renaissance are illustrated. True, these pieces are not so dainty, or so exquisitely beautiful as much of the French work, yet, -they have a dignity of their own, and the carvings are stronger and more vigorous than those of French pro-duction. The Frontispiece of this work shows a very fine example of German work, and is quite modern, both in style and construction. -The German bed shown at Fig. 79 is quite a solid looking piece of furniture, but has an inviting and comfortable appearance. -The two old German chairs shown at Figs. 80 and 81, are comfortable even if they are heavily built and ponderous looking. They are substantial and strong. The little table, Fig. 82, is characteristic of old time German work. The bed shown in Fig. 83 is drawn from a photo taken of the bed used by Napoleon, and his consort, the unfortunate Josephine. It is said to be a very comfortable bed to rest in and there are many like it still used in France. -The sturdy old chair shown in Fig. 84, is from Spain. In form, the chair is of course, common enough; but a new idea may be gathered from the upholstery. It consists of stout velvet, stuffed properly with feathers, and quilted after down-quilt fashion. It is fastened to the walnut framing with \"extra size\" brass studs, and some neglige trellis fringe is added to finish. It seems to me that such quilted upholstery might be applied to many modern chairs where shallow stuffing is desirable. If hair is substituted for feathers, a comfortable and pleasing result could be obtained without the stuffiness and fragility of bottoming. Altogether this old chair looks commanding as the center-piece in the large glass case in which it is preserved. -We may now safetly turn to English, and American furniture, and its makers, of the eighteenth, and the latter part of the seventeenth centuries, which were the periods of the most artistic work. In the earliest work, the lingering of Gothic and early Renaissance principles of construction gave a respose of line and appearance of stability and permanence often lacking in French -furniture of the same time. French eighteenth-century furniture, though in reality very substantially built, is apt to have a fragile appearance, and every one knows that the grace and freedom of its curves are only to be had at the cost of a considerable loss of strength. In keeping to simpler and more rigid forms the English and American makers were preserving good traditions, and if their ornamental systems were seldom appropriate or in pure taste, at least good workmanship and careful finish cannot be denied them. -large bookcase, Fig. 85, as will be seen by the plan, is very simple in construction ; but what a hotch-potch the designer has made of Gothic-looking clustered columns, false pediment with olive mouldings, and classic -aeroteria. The other bookcase, Fig. 86, solid shelves alternating with closed cupboards, is again of sensible general design; but, though its proportions are much -better, there is a mixture of ornamental motives which strikes the eye as incongruous. The pretty rococo crestings, to which, if cast in brass or gilt, no one need object as a finish for the top of the piece, are still not in keeping with the severe geometrical tracery of the panels and sash lines. The two end cupboards especially are out of all harmony with the center form of the pediments. -The two night tables by Ince and Mayhew, Fig. 89, show, that to the right the pure French style; that to -the left the English taste in an uncommonly straightforward example. Nothing has here been borrowed of the French but its lightness and finish. The geometrical tracery is not put out of countenance by the very discreet introduction of rococo foliage scrolls at the feet and supporting the raised parts of the slight rail. One feels how much more comfortable an object it is than -its neighbor, which, though really as soundly built, has an air of being in full dress, and not to be familiarly treated. The supper Canterbury and stand by Sheraton -are likewise simple and of a sturdy elegance. It is in such pieces as these that we have the best work by the best workmen. A father and son, under the firm title of Win. Loyd & Son, Boston, Mass., made a lot of work of this kind before the revolution, and many pieces of this work found their way into Philadelphia and the south as far as Georgia ; and was quite common in the -New England States, New York, and New Jersey. Odd pieces are occasionally found in some of the old colonial houses. This work may be known by the two letters L and B, which are usually found burned in some out of the way place on the specimen. The letters were rudely cut in the brand. -Chippendale the greatest English designer and cabinet maker revolutionized the styles of furniture and introduced many new features that seemed to take hold -of the people and stay by them, and his contemporaries and immediate followers kept the public favor by designing on lines somewhat similar to those of the master. Along with the meritorious things Chippendale designed there came a lot of stuff that was frivolous and -almost absurd and showed how the artist must have been lost in the struggle after novelties. His imitators were as faulty in many of their productions, and Sheraton, Heppelwhite, Mayhew, Ince, and even the Adam brothers, left much work behind them that had but little merit. I do not wish it to be inferred that I am -inveighling against the artistic merits of Chippendale and his coadjutors, I only speak of his shortcomings as a reminder,that even Homer himself sometimes nods. The chairs and table shown in Fig. 90 are fine examples of the masters\\' work and are really handsome designs, and paragons of good construction and faithful workmanship. -We show two plates — Nos. VIII and IX of Chippendale designs, which, with what we have shown in the foregoing pages, will enable our readers to recognize this master\\'s work at sight. Plate VIII, illustrates some of his best work, especially the chair backs shown at 11 and 12. The other backs shown 1, 3 and 9 are not so chaste but are favorites with some people. The designs shown on Plate IX, are very clever, and in some instances, beautiful but are not by any means up to the best standard of Chippendale\\'s work. -Perhaps on the whole, Sheraton, was as popular as any of the great English masters, and in our opinion, -justly so, for his work was, in many instances, as chaste in design, as finely finished and much more substantial in construction than the work turned out by Chippendale or Heppelwhite. Sheraton succeeded Chippendale -in fashionable esteem, and was a more sober and elegant designer. His pieces never offend the eye, but, on the other hand, they are not so characteristic as those of his less artistic predecessor. The double chair, Fig. 91, covered with a piece of Aubusson tapestry, is in his style, though it may not be of his make. He was very ingenious in inventions of the sort, and numerous contrivances for getting double service out of chairs and tables, are ascribed to him. The sofa, Fig. 92, is an excellent example of the same taste, for the alliance of straight lines with refined curves, on which his fame chiefly rests; indeed, reticence in ornament was his study. -The sofa shown in Fig. 93, is a dainty work both in design and finish, and is a typical Sheraton. The two -settles shown at Fig. 94 and 95, are Sheraton\\'s work and are good examples of his style on furniture of this -kind. They are evidently derived from the sofa of the period, diminished in size and robbed of its back. -of its class, well worthy of reproduction, notwithstanding that the center-table is at present out of favor. The diagram, Fig. 97, explains the somewhat unusual construction, and shows how the problem of drawers in a circular plan has been solved. The fictitious quadrant-drawers are really little cupboards, as is indicated in the working drawing. That any manufacturer to-day would invest the labor needed to make this table properly, is perhaps, doubtful; yet the elements of its construction deserves study and adaptation. -The little table, and the arm-chair shown at Fig. 98, are fine chaste specimens of the Sheraton period and could well afford to be imitated. If space allowed we would very much like to publish three or four plates of Sheraton\\'s designs, but we have already devoted more space than we first intended, so in this case we offer one Plate, X, which shows up quite a number of Sheraton\\'s -best designs ; and these, along with the figured illustrations, will, we think, make sufficient exhibits for one purpose. -Plates XI and XII show some fine examples of Heppelwhite\\'s work. These are choice specimens of this style, and show up some very good work. Plate XII exhibits six sideboards, four pedestals, and a tea chest by Heppelwhite. The dimensions of the sideboards -are :— Length, from 5^ ft. to 7 ft. ; height, 3 ft. ; depth, 28 in. to 32 in. The notes referring to Nos. 5, 8, 9, and 1 1 state that \"the ornaments to the fronts . . . may be carved, painted, or inlaid with various colored woods.\" The pedestals were made of the same height as the sideboards, were generally about 16 in. or 18 in. -square, and were often surmounted by vases from 2 ft. to 2 ft. 3 in. high. The ornamentation of the tea chest may, according to Heppel white\\'s book, either be inlaid, or \"painted and varnished.\" -Heppelwhite, while he did not reach the height in public esteem that Chippendale and Sheraton did, his work was much sought for and enormous prices were paid for examples, and to-day, when fashion has changed somewhat, well authenticated examples command prices that place them beyond the reach of or-dinary purses. Cases are quoted where a single chair brought as much as 200\\' dollars. The designs which we illustrate could, probably, be reproduced for one-third of that sum, and with the carving omitted for still less. That is assuming that costly wood, like rosewood or mahogany, is exacted, and providing for the very best workmanship; quite as artistic results may be obtained as in those of the originals. -The most notable difference between the chairs of Heppelwhite and Chippendale is that the latter affected the large square backs and ultra-French details never -to the taste of Heppelwhite, who in his own book says : \\'\\'Our idea of the useful, in such articles as are generally serviceable in real life, is to unite elegance and utility, and blend the useful with the agreeable\"; this as he elsewhere points out, was better attained by allowing -English taste and workmanship full play, than alien styles too literally with many anacronisms. The four Heppelwhite arm chairs shown in Fig. 99 are fair samples of the style and show in them, the peculiar characteristics of the Heppelwhite treatment. -The general dimensions of Heppelwhite\\'s chairs are 19 or 20 inches for the width of the front; for the depth of the seat and length of seat frame, 17 inches each, and the total height about 3 ft. 1 in. He especially prided himself on the painted \"japanned\" decoration in his actual productions ; yet in writing he disclaimed the mere novelty of such fugitive decorations and most strongly recommended the more durable method of in-laying, although he confesses the former was pretty enough while it lasted. This divergence between theory and practice has always ruled in furniture, for, chosen -solely for its fashion and appearance by most buyers, no absurd innovation has failed to find a responsive purchaser. -Perhaps, of all the styles of furniture known, there is not one of them that appeals to the refined artistic feelings more than that evolved by the Adam Brothers -— Richard and James — who, in their early youth, became recognized as masters of elegant design. At this date, it is practically impossible to obtain a copy of their works, and to look them over Students are obliged to go to some National Library. There are copies we believe in the Lennox Library, New York, but we do not know of any other original work of theirs in the United States or even of copies of them. Examples of the work of these two men are scarcely ever found in the market, but when such is the case, the demand for fhem is so great that ridiculously high prices are paid for their possession. The efforts of these designers were secured altogether by royalty and the Nobility, and this accounts largely for the scarcity of examples. -Plates XIII and XIV, show a few examples of work in this style. Plate XIII shows a number of details for furniture and general house finish. Plate XIV shows a portion of an octagon Boudoir in this style, with several pieces of furniture and fittings. This style is better known as \"The Adam\\'s Classic Style,\" and is very beautiful indeed. -With this (Plate XIV) we will close this essay on \"style,\" as those we have mentioned cover pretty nearly all those various modes of construction and decoration worthy of the name of \"style.\" -We have not said much of the \"Gothic Style\" for this is not supposed to be employed — only for church work, though sometimes it is made use of in dwellings for -the clergy, or similar purposes. We may have more to say of \"Gothic,\" later on. The \"New Art\" or \"Art Nouveau,\" which was in such vogue a few years ago, was simply a \"fad,\" and is now dead, and properly so — and is not likely to be even resurrected. We devote one Plate, XV, to this fad, so that posterity may have some idea as to what \"Art Nouveau\" was, \"once upon a time.\" -dreams or not ; Yet I dyd see soe vyvydly what I wyll eke rehearse, I wyst some lesson there must be yn thys, my humble -Yt soe befell upon a daye ye desygn I\\'d conceyve, I drew yt not for Art, buy paye, my fortune to ret rye ve ; I took yt to a fact\\'ry wyght, syth he was kynd to me, I thought he eke yn kyndness myght some meryt yn yt see. -\"The Mission fad, is nearly as unartistic as the \"Art Nouveau\" and because of its easy construction, is likely to become more popular. This should be called \"The carpenter style,\" for every carpenter having a fair knowledge of his trade, should be able to make almost any kind of \"Mission Furniture.\" This style has no Artistic merit other than its simplicity and honesty. -On plate XV, a number of picturesque examples of \"Swiss work\" is shown. We offer these examples because of their artistic features, and their appropriateness for articles of furniture for sea or lakeside cottages, or bungalows. All these articles shown are easily made and as easily kept clean if left in a natural condition. -Fig. ioo shows an old Scandinavian choir which exhibits good solid workmanship. Fig. 101 shows a room -fitted up in oriental style with a few pieces of oriental furniture shown where some idea as to the shape and style of decoration of such furniture may be gleaned. Fig. 1 02, shows an ebony \\'Koran\" holder, from -The chairs shown in Fig. 104, are of old German type and are, without doubt, a pair of cosy, comfortable chairs. The woodwork on them seems to be ash, but is -dark with age. The stiff prim looking chair shown in Fig. 105, is of old Dutch parentage, and has a stately, if not a lordly appearance. -Fie. 106, shows another old Dutch chair, with cabriole legs. This is rather a pretentious affair. The Italian chair shown at Fig. 107 is of late Italian Renaissance style and is overloaded with unnecessary and -frivolous carvings. It is a comfortable chair to sit in but is unwieldly and ponderous. Fig. 108, exhibits a neat German chair suitable for a library, den or even a hall. The carving on it, is chaste and excellently wrought. -the most dainty pieces of furniture in existence. It was probably made by Oeban or Riesner and shows the most exquisite workmanship. As a mere matter of value it would probably fetch about thrice its weight in gold. It is throughout a model of the finest art workmanship, within and without; the beautiful marquetry panels ; the elaborately chased metal mounts ; the choice little porcelain requisites might each form the subject of a special essay. The table has only to be seen to be coveted. We are convinced that nothing we have seen of this description before or after, can compare in elegance and beauty with this little escritoire, once used by Marie Antoinette. -The table shown in Fig. no, is German, and has a massive characteristic look, it is intended for library purposes. Fig. 1 1 1 shows a work table made for the -ill-fated Marie Antoinette and is considered a gem in its way and has a value far beyond the reach of ordinary mortals. -The table shown in Fig. 112, is in Mahogany and was executed for the war department, Washington. D. C. It is a fine specimen of American workmanship. It was made in Boston, Mass. The dainty little writing desks shown in Figs. 113 and 1 14, are of French manufacture of the period of Marie Antoinette, and were the forerunners of many of the present beautiful writing desks that are being made now by the thousands in -some of our Cabinet factories. They are worth imitating as they contain many features of beauty and good taste. -Stepping from chairs and tables to cabinets we have a large field to gather from, but it is not our intention -to deal at length with these articles, so a few examples must suffice. The Cabinet — or Armoire, as it is called in French — shown in Fig. 115 is said to be one of the finest pieces of woodwork in the world. It was designed -by Berain, and executed by Boulle, for Louis XIV. The delicacy and beauty of the coloring of the inlaid brass work, in metal of two tints, the boldness of the arabesque work, and the fine proportions and unusual -The German cabinet shown in Fig*. 116, is a very fine example of workmanship, and nearly equals the French work in Artistic merit. The cabinet shown at Fig. 117, is not given for its beauty, but because of the usefulness, and combined purposes. It is in Queen Anne style and may prove suggestive, if nothing more. -two very fine cabinets well suited to receive curios and artistic trinkets. They are artistically designed. -Wall, or hanging cabinets, are very useful articles of furniture, and designs for them are numerous — -many of which are good — but we give a few herewith, which we think possess several good features. The two designs shown at Fig. 120 are very simple but very effective. The same may be said of the three designs shown in Fig. 121. These latter may be used for cabinets to hang on a flat wall, or for corner cabinets. -The Gothic style followed the Romanesque or roundarched. In France and England it developed towards the end of the twelfth century. In this country the Decorated Gothic was the second stage (during the fourteenth century), and the Perpendicular Gothic followed in the fifteenth. -The Moorish or Saracenic developed in the eighth century. It was the style of the Mohammedans. A feature of the style is its extraordinary geometrical combinations. The Alhambra (Granada), built in the thirteenth century, is considered the most perfect specimen of architecture in this style. -Francis I. belongs to the Early French Renaissance ( 1 515-1549). It is freely ornamented Gothic, developing under Italian influence. Its feature is a minuteness of detail. The palace of Fontainebleau was built in this style by Francis I. -Henry II. (Middle French Renaissance), who followed Francis L, developed the existing style along lines of greater purity, more closely resembling the original Italian. Many of the details in this style are applicable to modern requirements. -Henri IV. brings us to the period of the Late French Renaissance ( 1 589-1610). A study of the illustrations following will clearly show the tendency of the time, preparing the way for the magnificence of the Louis XIV. style (treated later). -Louis XIV. ( 1 643-1 715). Magnificence in decorative designing. The era of Chas. le Brun, Andre Chas. Boulle, Jean Berain, Jean Le Pautre, and Daniel Marot. -Louis XV. (1723-1774), Rococo period. The leading men of the time are Watteau, Nicholas Pineau, Jacques Caffieri, Jules Aurele Meissonier, Jacques Blondel, Denizol, Chas. Cressent, Oeben, Tessier, and Martin (originator of Vernis-Martin panels). -Louis XVI. (1774-1792-), Era of daintiness and grace. Rococo ornament suppressed. The boudoir supersedes the salon. The leading men were Gouthiere, David Roentgen, and Riesner. -The Empire was a return, under Napoleon, to the classic styles of Greece and Rome. Details include decorated cornices, caryatides, pilasters, etc. -The English Renaissance was introduced at the beginning of the Sixteenth Century. The Elizabethan was its \"golden age.\" The details on Page 121 are from the chimney-piece in the library at Holland House, the fretwork is from Audley End, and the carved panel is at the South Kensington Museum. -Chippendale (1754) needs little comment. His designs include French details, and also show signs of Chinese influence. -Sheraton ( 1751) is too well known to need description. The details given in this style are illustrative of all phases of his work. -Adam (1773) details are architectural, the furniture of the Brothers Adam being chiefly constructed to harmonize with the buildings in which it was to be used. -In a simple treatise it is quite impossible to conveyany adequate idea of the art of cabinet-making. So much could be said that it is most difficult to know what to leave out, and however fully this subject may be enlarged upon, the broad fact that but one-half has been told must remain. Further, a budding cabinetmaker will learn more during the first twelve months of his apprenticeship than all the text-books in the country can teach him. The old Roman motto, Ezperientia docet, is truer to-day than ever. Experience has been, and will be, the best teacher ; but just as it is possible to start in life with better prospects upon the solid foundations laid by one\\'s forebears, so by the aid of a few practical suggestions may a youth be helped upward on the ladder of perfection. The cabinet-maker must always strive after excellence. There is absolutely no room for men who are only halfmasters of their craft ; the net result of incompetence is a general leveling of the highest to the least efficient, a diminution of the rate of wages, and a disastrous lowering of the quality of work. The various styles of workmanship should incite the cabinet trade of today to patient and thoughtful work. It may be urged — and possibly truly — that these master-pieces of which we speak were not the daily product of the age which produced them. That inferior work was then produced -may be admitted; but the mere fact that time has wrought its destruction should be sufficient evidence that this class of work is not such as the twentiethcentury cabinet-maker should imitate. -And here one word to the journeyman of to-day. The apprentice working under your superintendence will be exactly as you make him. Men are copyists ever, and youth is the most impressionable period. See to it, then, that your work be such as the novice treading in your footsteps may safely follow. And let the apprentice benefit by his master\\'s experience, commencing where the latter leaves off, and thus raising the handicraft to a higher level of excellence. The only true way to success is that the heart be in the work; toiling not merely for the \"standard wage,\" nor creating a piece of work only to \"sell/\\' but to last. -Just as to-morrow is the child of to-day, so is the journey-man the fulfilment of the apprenticeship. The groundwork of early days is the foundation upon which the after-work stands, and if the first be faulty then is there but inefficiency hereafter. One word as to the influence of trades-unionism upon the cabinet trade — it has its strong and weak points. On the one hand it demands, and rightly, from the master a standard rate of wage, which is beneficial insomuch ;that it puts all union shops on the same level, and prevents that \"cutting\" policy which is alike disastrous to good work and sound finance. On the other hand it gives no guarantee -of efficiency in the worker ; good and bad are linked in one union, with the result that the least efficient are often out of work and maintained at the expense of their more skilled brothers. The remedy for this seems to lie here : let no man be made a member until he has passed through a satisfactory apprenticeship, and proved himself to be thoroughly acquainted with his trade, and capable of honestly earning the wage demanded; then would the term \"union man\" be understood to mean skill and efficiency, and be as proud a possession of the man earning it as a degree to a college graduate. -Possibly it may be thought that the proceeding lines have savoured too much of the ethics of labor — of work in its highest and ideal form — rather than of the practical teaching of a competing age. But there is a danger that in the mad rush for cheap and badly manufactured furniture the true constructive art may be lost, and a race of men produced wedded to one job, year in and year out, and turning out work bearing neither the stamp of individuality nor the spirit of good workmanship. -Where a draughtsman is not employed, the usual method of setting out work is to make a full-size detail from the scale-drawing supplied.. This is done most conveniently upon 36-inch lining-paper strained upon a board, say 7 ft. x 4 ft. This size will be found to be large enough for most jobs, which need only be drawn -in the majority of cases to the center line, thus showing half the width of the job, the other half being a repeat. The thickness-sections, for the sake of clearness, may be put in with blue or red pencil. Having accomplished this, the next proceeding will be to take off the drawing the various sizes of the several pieces of wood, allowing sufficient margin for finishing to the net sizes, and for the length of tenons, &c. Many of the small pieces can be obtained from the \"scrap\"-room, where all sorts of ends, strips, &c, are stored in their respective classes, thus saving the cutting of a large board for the purpose of an odd rail or so, which might render it useless by reason of a corner having been cut away. -Tools. — The trade of to-day is so much the product of machine labor, that in a fully-equipped shop, where furniture is made to \"stock\" designs, the manual work is little more than that of fitting together the various parts. It is, however, still necessary that the craftsman should be fully acquainted with the use of the tools usually associated with the cabinet-maker\\'s bench. The following list includes all those commonly required, but special tools may be necessary in certain cases : -CABINET MAKERS\\' JOINTS, &c. What may be termed \"edge-joints\" are a necessity in cabinet-making, because timber is not always obtainable wide enough for the counter-top or panel desired; and if it were so, the cost would prohibit its general use; but more because a jointed top or panel will stand much better than a single piece, and this is the chief thing to be aimed at. There is a tendency in some quarters to avoid jointing, but the policy is an unsound one. Again, in the case of oak panelling, a much better effect can be obtained by a jointed panel — throwing all the figures to the center line — than by a single unjointed board. The chief objection to jointing seems to lie in the idea that sooner or later the joint will give; it may, just as anything is likely to happen in badly-constructed work, but given thoroughly dry and seasoned timber, a sound method of jointing, and a good workman to do it, nothing need be feared. The -necessity for jointing will, of course, be governed by the width of the timber employed. It may, however, be taken as a general rule that nothing wider than 13 or 14 inches should be used in a single piece, except in the case of countertops, which often run 3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet wide, and should only have one joint. -There are several methods of jointing which we will now consider in detail: (1) Glue joint; (2) Giue-anddowel; (3) Tongue-and-groove (or rebate); and (4) Double groove and loose tongue. -The Glue Joint shown in Fig. 123 is perhaps the commonest of cabinet joints for such work as bears no weight, — that is, perpendicular work, as carcase ends. The method of making the joints is briefly thus : The two boards are shot with a trying or jointing plane until the surface edges are absolutely true; one piece is placed in the bench-cramp, the other being held so that -the two edges are together; run thin glue along the joint, then work the loose board backwards .and forwards along its fellow until the superfluous glue is extracted; the joint should now be allowed to set. If the work has been well done the wood is much more likely -to break at some other point than the joint. Complete success depends upon two factors — true jointing with the plane, and good glue. There are so many good makes of the latter that there should be no difficulty whatever in obtaining it. Remember that the best glue is always the cheapest, for two reasons — its adhesive qualities and capacity for absorption of water. Good glue should take up its own weight of water, i. e., i lb. of glue in the oake should produce 2 lbs. weight in liquid -form. The joint to be glued should be thoroughly warmed, as this makes the glue much more adhesive than if applied to a cold surface. -addition of a series of dowels placed along the joint, the object being to ensure greater strength for such purposes as a countertop. The dowels may be ft inch or y 2 inch in diameter, according to the thickness of the timber to be jointed. They should be placed (say) 12 inches apart and bored in 1 inch deep, the end of the dowel glued and knocked in with a framing hammer, then sawn off to the depth of the corresponding hole, and the ends of the dowels rounded over; glue both edges of the joint, the dowels, and dowel-holes, knock down, and cramp up. The superfluous glue will thus be -The Tongue-and-Groove Joint, Fig. 125, possesses advantages not found in the preceding ones, viz. a greater strength, and should the joint \"give,\" the presence of the tongue prevents light from showing through. With -a pair of match-planes make a groove on one piece onethird the width of the timber used, by half an inch deep, and make a corresponding tongue on the other piece. When this has been done, fit the two together, seeing that the tongue will move freely along the groove, then glue and rub together as in Fig. 123, and cramp up. -In the Double Groove and Loose Tongue (Fig. 126) — the main idea seems to be that when jointing two soft-woods together a hard-wood tongue (which should be cut across the grain) may be inserted, rendering the -joint less liable to snap than if a tongue were cut on the soft-wood itself and lengthways with the grain. Proceed as in Fig. 125, only making two grooves, each the same width and depth; glue the joints and loose tongue ; rub, and cramp up. -We have previously spoken of straight jointing for panels, carcass ends, &c, but the methods described are not suitable for the joints of pieces meeting at an angle, as in the framing of a door or of panelling. Joints of this kind may be considered under four heads: (1) Dovetailing ; ( 2 ) Mortise-and-tenon ; ( 3 ) Dowel ; and (4) Mitre. Two broad principles would seem to govern these, viz. that the wood employed be absolutely dry, and that the joint be true. Any deviation from either of these fixed rules must result in failure; and the second is to a large extent dependent on the first, for however good the workmanship may be, if the wood be unseasoned shrinkage must inevitably occur, with the result that it is almost impossible to put the work right when once the job has been framed up. Hence the necessity of insisting that absolutely dry stuff is an essential in the cabinet trade. -1. Dovetailing*— Fig. 127, is undoubtedly the joint par excellence for cabinet work ; it takes three forrns. No. 1 represents the ordinary open dovetail. Each piece to be^ clp-vetailed is marked with a gauge and regulator, spacing the dovetails according to the width of wood to be jointed. This form is used wherever the -construction is hidden from view, its defect being that the ends of the dovetail are cut completely through, thus showing, if exposed, the end grain of the \"keys\" of the other piece. When this is not desired the dovetail is made as No. 2. All dovetails should be cut wedge-shaped, so that when glued and hammered they will tighten up, and when smoothed down present a perfect joint. -The overlapping or concealed dovetail (No. 2) is used in drawer fronts, where it is desirable to conceal the mode of construction. The dovetail is cut entirely through the side, but only two-thirds through the front ; the joint, therefore, is visible on the end only and not on the front. This is an absolute necessity in the case of veneering, for which purpose an absolutely flat surface must be obtained, otherwise the \"keys\" would show through the thin veneer and spoil the whole effect. The jointing up and finishing is precisely the same as in No. 1. -The mitre-dovetailed (No. 3) is adopted for fine work where it is undesirable to show the dovetail either on front or side, and consists of a dovetail having a mitre on each outside edge; the finished joint appears as a single mitre without disclosing the dovetail within. -The Mortise-and-Tenon is the most satisfactory joint for two pieces in the same plane meeting at an angle ; it takes a variety of forms (Fig. 128). The main point to be borne in mind is that the parts to form the -joint be cut true; otherwise, either the tenon will be slack and the joint useless, or too tight and will split open the mortise. -tenon will be slightly wedged. Other methods of fixing the joints are : ( i ) to make the mortise large enough to admit of a wedge being driven in on each side the tenon, which effectually \"keys\" it; in this case the tenon is usually put in dry, that is without glue; and (2) to split open the tenon with a chisel, and insert a wedge in the center and drive home. The danger of -this method is that the tenon is liable to be necked off at the shoulder, while in the former case the rail may be split. If the mortise and tenon are fitted true, no wedging should be necessary. -The thickness of the tenon should be one-third that of the rail and the width not more than 4 inches. If a wider rail has to be used, it would be better to make two mortises and tenons, as shown in Nos. 4 and 5. -can be made as shown, or of the full width between the grooves, which are made on either side for the purpose of receiving the panels. -mortises. These should be cut slightly deeper than the tenon, the joint being glued up and cramped. -Nos. 4 and 5. — Methods of framing wide rails by means of double-tenons, suitable for doors where wide rails are necessary. No. 4 is usually called a gunstock joint. -In framing angles having moulds on one or both edges, the moulds may be intersected either by mitring or scribing. In the mitred joint, the moulds are cut down at an angle of 45 degrees to the mortise-hole, and the moulds adjoining the tenon are cut to fit. The only danger in this method is that, if the wood is wet the mitre will dry in, leaving an open space impossible to deal with. -The process of scribing (Fig. 130) is to cut under one of the rails to the pattern of the other which it is -intended to join ; but this cannot so easily be done with mouldings containing many members, as it would be too costly. It, however, has the advantage that, if shrinkage occurs, the joint can be knocked up again, which would be impossible in the former case. -although not invariably. Fig. 131 shows a scribed joint for panel-mouldings. The vertical moulding C is cut away at A to fit on to the horizontal moulding D. The thick line AB shows the line the scribe will make at the point of intersection. -3. Dowel-Joint (Fig. 132) though often adopted, as it economizes labor, is not as satisfactory as the mortiseand-tenon. The dowels, which are usually }i inch in diameter, often shrink, causing the joint to \"give.\" If the dowels are of beech and the timber dry, the joint should be satisfactory. The usual method of setting out a doweljoint is to cut a piece of paper the size of the rail and prick through the centers required according to -the number of dowels desired. These are afterwards marked upon the timber itself. If the wood is not more than i inch thick, the dowels should be set out in the center of the rail in a straight line ; if thicker wood is used, put the dowels in zigzag fashion, which is the better way where it can be managed. -Where small sizes are used, the joint at the angle formed by two pieces not in the same plane is usually mitred. The construction of the joint is thus hidden. No. i, Fig. 133, shows an ordinary mitre at an angle of 45 degrees, such as is used in the framing of a plinth or cornice frieze; the joint is strengthened by a block inside. No. 2 represents the same method, with the additional safeguard of keys ; this would be adopted in the case of thin wood where the mitre surface is very -small, and where there is consequently a liability to break ; the keys are usually put in with veneer, a saw-cut being all that is necessary for their insertion. Glue is run in and the joint levelled off. No. 3 is a variation of No. i. -Fig. 134, shows an angle framed by dowels, having on the one edge a bead, which breaks the joint; this would be used in framing a pilaster upon the end of a carcass. -No. 1, Fig. 136, shows the method of framing a through rail intersected into a center leg, not more than three inches square. No. 2 shows the construction if the center leg is above that size, and is not mortised or dowelled. No. 3 is copied from an old card-table ; the shouldering and dovetailing of the rail show advantages over No. 1, -A cornice may be worked out of the solid piece or built up in various pieces. The latter form is usually adopted by cabinet-makers, except for small cornices. No. i, Fig. 137, shows a built-up mould; the pieces -should be glued and screwed together, blocks being put at the back to give additional strength. No. 2 shows a solid hardwood moulding faced upon softwood, the mould having a rebate for the insertion of a dentil (shown by dotted lines), egg-and-dart, or other ornament. -Ofttimes the cabinet-maker is left to design the mouldings, in which case it is absolutely necessary that he be thoroughly conversant with the mouldings of the particular style or period in which he is working, as a Gothic mould would be out of place upon a Renaissance piece of work, and a Jacobean cornice upon a Sheraton -job. If the designer is not conversant with the grammar of ornament, all kinds of incongruous mixtures are -created, neither true to style nor beautiful. The same remarks apply also to carving and turnery, and as there -are so many text-books of style published, there is absolutely no excuse for ignorance in this matter. -Another point upon which a word may be said is the proportioning of mouldings one to the other in the building-up of a cornice. Let it be supposed that one has to be stuck by hand. It is frequently possible to pick out a series of stock members all the same size, Figure 139 -and to strike out a variety of cornices by ringing the changes on them. The result, however, will be a moulding as shown in No. 1, Fig. 138, where all the members, a,b,c,d,e,f, are of equal depth. This is both incorrect and inelegant ; no moulding made up of a series of members should have any two in conjunction of the same depth, but the proportion should be varied after the manner shown in No. 2, the effect of which — it will be at once apparent — is much better than No. 1. -In cabinet-work the methods of hanging a door, table-leaf, &c, to its corresponding part, are simple, and the foundation of the joint varies but little, though in the case of hanging a door with heavy projecting moulding and cornice upon the face, special long-shouldered butts would be used. The main point in all hangings by -means of hinges is to see that each hinge bears its due proportion of weight, thus avoiding strain and consequent friction and possibly breakage. -Hinges may be of cast or malleable iron, steel, brass, copper, gun-metal, or a combination of metals, such as brass with steel washers ; for heavy work these washers should always be used, the wearing parts being stronger. -The earliest form of hinge seems to have been in the form of an oak pin (A Fig. 139) shaped from the rail itself, and working in a socket cut into the cross rail above, the doors being framed up with the job itself; the form is common in fifteenth and sixteenth century woodwork. Later, the influence of Flemish work. is -apparent, and the pinjoint gives place to wrought-iron hinges placed upon the face of the door and frame with artistic effect, and attached by means of large-headed hails (Fig. 140). During the Queen Anne and Chippendale periods, the hinges were delicately made of cast brass and fixed by screws. -The ordinary way of hanging by butts is shown in No. 1, Fig. 141, the rebate is not carried through the wood, and the knuckle projects on the front side. If this is not desired, the hinges must be fixed flush, and a bead of the. same thickness as the knuckle run down -to make a better finish. When a lid is to be hinged, it would be done as in No. 2, the overhang at the back being, in the case of a small lid, sufficient to serve as a stop when the lid is open. -In hanging a table-leaf, many forms may be adopted. No. 1, Fig. 142, shows a beaded and rebated joint, the center of the hinge being directly under the joint. Exccpt for dust-proof or light-tight purposes, the rebate is not necessary. This joint would open to 90 degrees. Should the leaf or door require to fold back behind the other part, the hinp-e should be placed as shown in No. 2, the dotted lines showing the position of the leaf when -folded back. Another form of leaf hanging is that known as a \"rule joint,\" which is shown closed in No. 3, and open in No. 4. This has the advantage of concealing the hinge, and making a better finish when open -than otherwise would be the case ; the joint is somewhat difficult to get true, but always repays the labor in effect. A variation of this joint is shown in No. 5. -.Carcass doors are generally hung as shown in No. 1, Fig. 143, a bead the size of the knuckle being run down to break the joint, and the hinge rebated into the -door its entire thickness. No. 2 shows the method of hanging on to the ends of a carcass* where the full clearance of the door is desired, such as would be the case in a cupboard fitted with sliding trays. No. 3 shows the same method, but with air-tight bead for a cabinet or show-case. -Center hanging, as for wardrobe doors, is shown in Nos. 4 and 5, the door being set back in a rebate, or having a pilaster planted on to hide the joint. Sometimes this joint is made on the rule principle, but this adds to the expense. -Special hinges, such as are made for card-tables, bureaus, pianos, &c, while varying in shape and size to suit requirements, are fitted in exactly the same manner as the foregoing illustrations indicate. -It is not our intention to offer much in the line of practical examples, showing details, dimensions of materials and methods of making such examples ; but it is thought a few instances specified in full, may prove of use to the apprentice and younger workmen, who may, want to \"make things\" during their leisure hours, or at odd times. We start off with a piece of work in the socalled mission style and which is easy to make. This makes a good table for a library, a den or an office. Besides fulfilling its purpose as a library table, it can be used as a bookcase, where the library is very small, and for a writing desk. The writing materials can be kept in the drawer and the absence of a lower shelf makes it possible to put the feet well under the table without interference. -The best lumber to use is oak, plain or quartered, as suits the convenience and pocket-book of the builder. Order it from the mill as follows and insist on its being well sanded before you accept it, as this greatly lessens the labor involved in its building. -Three-eighth inch dowel pins should be used to fasten the shelves and top onto the legs, and if you run them through the legs, cover the ends with wooden buttons. The drawer linings can be nailed in place as the nailheads will not show, and the other pieces can be screwed in place. -If desired, birch or other hard-wood may be used in lieu of oak, and the whole may be stained to suit the taste. -The illustrations show the method of construction and positions of rails, &c, and as they are all figured, showing lengths and positions, there will be no trouble in laying the table out or assembling the parts. -Fig. 144, shows a general plan and sideelevation, and Fig. 145 shows end elevation, whileFig> 146, gives a perspective view of the finished work. -147. This table is quite simple and may be easily made by an apprentice or any person who understands the use of ordinary woodworking tools. The table is equally suitable for use in the parlor, library or living room. -Fig. 148 is the side plan and dimensions of the table. The bottom footboard can be made twelve inches wide and held in place with three round-head brass screws at each end, which will make it very strong and neat in appearance. -Fig. 149 shows all dimensions and specifications for the ends. The top and bottom rails are ]/% inch thick, while the slats are only % inch. -The top is held to the frame by glueing cleats on the inside of the top rails, then running screws through them into the top. -All the joints are tenon and mortise and glued. The ends are glued and clamped first, then the top side, rails, while the bottom foot -board comes last. -These two examples exhibit the whole method of Mission furniture construction, and are quite sufficient to serve our purposes. -The sideboard which is shown in perspective without the drawers by Fig. 1 50, has been designed specially for those with limited experience, and in its construction mortises, tenons, and dovetails are avoided. For fixing the various parts, glue and nails are only required. -Planed pine boarding as used for building purposes, will be found suitable; and when finished the job may be stained and varnished to suit. Fig. 151, is a half front elevation, and Fig. 152, end elevation, each drawer to scale. -The measurements may be taken from these two Figures, but for simplicity the finished sizes of the various pieces of wood are as follows: i-in. stuff (finishing about % in. thick), top A (Fig. 151 and 152), 4 ft. 6 in. by 1 ft. 8 in. ; ends B, 3 ft. by 1 ft. 5 in. ; bottom C, 3 ft. io^4 in. by 1 ft. 5 in. ; upper ends D, 2 ft. 6 in. by S l / 2 in. ; cornice E, 4 ft. 5 in. by 10^2 in. ; pediment F, 4 ft. by 6 in. (widest part) ; drawers bearer G, 3 ft. ioy 2 in. by 3% in. ; division H between drawers, 1 ft. 5 in. by 4^2 in. ; brackets J, 6 in. by 5 in. ; shaped span-rail K, 3 ft. 10^2 in. by 3 in. ; and corner shelves, 11 in. by 7 in. The pieces of ^4-in. stuff are: For the doors (made of three thicknesses of stuff), four stiles L, 2 ft. 1 in. by 3 in.; four cross rails 1 ft. $% in. by 3 in., and for the back face of the doors, four -stiles i ft. 7^/2 in. by 2^4 in., and four cross rails i ft. 1 1 34 in. by 2j4 in. The J^-in. stuff required (finishing about yi in.) is: Two door panels, i ft. yYi in. by i ft. -SH in. wide; carcass back M (Fig. 152), sufficient matchboarding -3 ft. high at the ends and 4 ft. in width ; for drawer fronts, two pieces N (Fig. 153), 1 ft. io}i in. by 4 J / 2 in.; two pieces O (Fig. 153), 1 ft. 10^ in. by 4 T / 2 in.; for the drawer sides P (Fig. 154), four pieces 1 ft. 4% in. rjy 4 l / 2 in.; drawer backs Q (Fig. -154), two pieces 1 ft. io}i in. by $ l / 2 in. ; for the upper part of the sideboard (made up of three thicknesses of stuff), two front stiles R (Fig. 151), 2 ft. 6 in. by 2*4 in. ; two inner stiles S, 1 ft. 4 in. by 2j4 in. ; cross rails T, 3 ft. 6 in. by 3% in. ; cross rails U and V, 3 ft. 6 in. by 2% in. ; panel W, 3 ft. 6 l / 2 in. by 6]/ 2 in. ; -panel X, 1 ft. 4>4 in. by 1 ft. 4 J / 2 in. by 8^2 in. For inner layer Y and back layer Z (see Figs. 155 and 156, and 157), allow the stiles and rails to be % in. narrower than the front layer R, S, T, U, and V (Fig. 151). The shaped headings of the panels in the doors and top part are % in. thick. The top and ends being wider than the usual width of deal boards, these will have to be jointed and glued. White wood or pine can be obtained wide enough without joining; both woods are very suitable for varnishing. -In beginning the construction, the wood should be first planed to thickness, then the front edges, next the ends squared up, and finally taken to width. The bottom C is fixed with 2 J / 2 -in. oval nails driven through the ends B. Oval nails have small heads and are less un-sightly when the work is filled up for varnishing or polishing. Next the bearer G and then top A are nailed in the same way. When nailing, if the nails are driven -slantwise, alternately leaning towards the front and back, they will act like dovetails, and prevent the top from lifting or the ends drawing away from the bot-torn. The latter may also be prevented by screwing a strip to the under side of the bottom C and to the ends as shown in Fig. 158. Note that the top projects -ij4-in. nails. The outer edges M (Fig. 152) should be worked half-round in section with a smoothing plane and course glasspaper; it will then look like a bead moulding worked on the back edges of the ends. -The doors made up of two thicknesses may next be taken in hand. Fig. 159 shows the stiles L fixed with glue and nails to the back cross rails ; the front rails and back stiles are next fitted. Note that the back stiles and rails are % in. narrower than the front, so as to provide a rebate for the panels; see Fig. 160, which is an enlarged section of the door, stiles, and panel. When the doors are together, the shaped headings may be fitted; or for a better construction, the stiles and top rail could be rebated to receive it. -The drawer sides are nailed to the inner front O (Fig. 153) and back Q (Fig. 154). Strips A \\'(Fig. 154) are nailed to the sides for the bottom to rest on, the latter passing under the back O. The outer drawer front N is nailed to the drawer sides and glued to O. Of course, this method of construction is only to avoid dovetailing and ploughed grooves for the bottom. -The framing of the top part (Fig. 161) is fitted between ends D (Figs. 151 and 152) and under the shelf E, and rests on the top A. The method of construction is similar to the doors, the joints of the outer face being as shown in Fig. 151. The middle portion Y -is as shown in Fig. 161, and the back face Z (Figs. 155, 156, and 157) the same as the front face in Fig. 151. The center mirror may be of bevelled-edge or plain silvered plate; or if desired a wood panel could be fixed. The half circular headings are fixed as described for the doors. The corner shelves, ends D, and shelf E are fixed to the framing with 2-in. nails. -to the lower by driving screws through the under side of the top A into the ends D, also into the back framing -( Fig. 1 6 1 ) . Suitable brass or copper handles for doors and drawers will add to the appearance of the sideboard. -dissolved in hot water; less potash for oak than for walnut or mahogany. The correct shade may be got by experimenting on an odd piece of wood. When the stain is dry, give a coating of glue size. Then thin coats of varnish. When all parts show a gloss, put aside for twenty-four hours, then glasspaper, and apply the finishing coats of varnish or French polish. Bismarck brown added to the varnish will give mahogany color. -We show herewith in Figs. 162, 163, 164 and 165, part elevations and details of two low-cost sideboards, to make will be excellent practice for the younger workmen. -Fig. 162 includes center and two small side mirrors in upper part and three drawers, two cupboards and center recess in lower part. Height from A to B, 12 in.; B to C, 2 ft. 9 in. ; C to D, 3 ft. 3 in. ; cupboard door, say, 23 in. by 17 in.; depth of drawers, 5 in. outside. Turning is introduced, with alternative details for selection. Note swell and taper to turned column B, C, 2 J4in. swell, and see end elevation at Fig. 164, with 3^in. column receded. Corner B, with dentils and frieze, about 4 in. ; lined up top C, 2 24 in. moulded; 1 in. solid fronts to drawers, faced with y 2 in. moulded and mitred strips. One 5-in., or two 3^2-in. lacquered brass handles. Hobbs\\' four lever locks. Panel at E may repeat on end, less capping: Shelf inside cupboard, 1 in. moulded thumb; 2-in. brass butt hinges; i-in. -ends, and I ft. 9 in. back to front; i%-in. posts; i-in. door stiles and rails ; bottom under drawers through to back; flush framed back, }i in., let in rebates; i-in. bevel to mirror, ij^-in. framing to back. Fig. 2 all cupboard doors, wood panels moulded; center mirror, 24 in. by 28 in.; back above F, 13^ in. high; F to G, 3 ft. 1 in. ; upper door I, 19 J/2 in. by 1 1 in. ; inside depth, Sy 2 in.; lower side door, 2 ft. 6]/ 2 in. by 14 in. If a leaf is cut in posts as indicated, it will ensure a good effect. The columns supporting upper cupboard will rest on toes at G, returning to intersect with base moulding of back. The sideboard upper backs is fixed to lower carcass by dowelling into top, and also by continuing the uprights, some 9 in. or 12 in., below top to be screwed to carcass back. Either canted, as shown, or quadrant corners would be suitable for center mirror. All shelves are indicated by an outlined base. Fig. 165 gives a few details: — A refers to (Fig. 162) section, i}i in., with top turning enlarged (J) ; K, small spindles in lower carcass ; B, enlarged detail for cornice frieze and column in Fig. 162 and cornice, etc., F (Fig. 163). The pattern shown in detail at L may be carved in frieze with good effect. M, section for moulding round center mirror; N, alternative to lesser columns at C (Fig. 164) ; O, dotted line of shelf (Fig. 162) ; C, G, detail for table top (Figs. 162 and 163) of i-in. stuff lined up; D, detail for Fig. 162 at floor line, iy 2 -\\'m. section. Door frames should be mortised -right through, as at P, and moulded oriels, the geometrical framing being mitred up and turned in to intersect to patterns shown. A section through lower carcass occurs at Q for pilasters and plain moulded panels front and ends. Another method is indicated by cut at R suitable for plain ends, vertical grain, or a 9-in. upper end rail, with panelling to match E (Fig. 162). -The half-Front elevation and details of sideboard in Fig. 166 is a little more pretentious than those preceding it, and of course will tax the skill of the workman proportionately, but we do not think it beyond the ability of the ordinary trained workman. The elevation sections and details have all been drawn to scale, and are, therefore, measurable. -Fig. 166 shows the half elevation. Fig. 167 shows section of lower portion and mirror portion of upper works. Fig. 167, is the upper part of board in section. The mouldings in section require no explanations. -Cabinet-makers as a rule do not often have calls to make Grandfather\\'s clock cases, but, it does sometimes fall to the lot of the workman to make a case, so it may not be amiss to give one or two simple designs on this work, giving dimensions and style of finish. The proper material to be employed in making this case is mahogany, but of course, walnut or quartered oak — darkened — will answer very well, but in either case, good workmanship and fine finish will be necessary to give the clock an artistic appearance. -The sizes given in this example are suitable for a clock with 12 in. dial, and the remarks which follow should render the setting out a simple matter. (A) The clock case Fig. 169, consists of sides, front, and corner only, so that it may be pushed on from the front, along the moulding E, the back ends of sides being rebated to fit over the back — an arrangement which renders the clock easily accessible. Height through center of dial from bottom of door to top of cornice, 25^2 in. Height of door in center, 21 in. ; the rise being 4^4 in. ; width, 15J4 in. ; frame, 1^8 in., out of j4-in. stuff, and glazed. The door shuts on to an inner frame of same size, out of }4-in. stuff, well screwed, with glued blocks. The ends, Sy 2 in. wide (cut out in center, and glazed, as G), and continued through cornice up to springing of top curve ; frieze and cornice are built up thereon. The top or \"roof\" of case is built up of >£-in. stuff, bradded or screwed to upper member of cornice, and to top back rail on case cut to same curve, both being rebated for the purpose. The cornice projects 1 % in. over sides, being supported by columns tapering from % in. to 1 in. diam. These may either be plain or mounted, with brass Corinthian capitals and bases, the shafts then being reeded. The upper finials are also of brass, and impart a most pleasing finish to the top. It should be added that the clock movement rests upon ledges about 4 J / 2 in. high, which also serves as guides to the loose case*, and steady it when in position. Body -of clock (B) : This is constructed of J^-in. stuff — front framed (dowelled or rebated 15 in. wide) into ij/4. in. posts, the outer corners of which are canted to receive ij4 m turned pillars. Sides 7 in. wide, rebated flush into posts and top and bottom rails, and also rebated to receive back. Hide joints of rebates -with a scratched brad. Back of 34 -in. stuff shaped at top to fit upper curve. Stiffen the joints with wellfitting blocks along the inner angles, using good strong glue for the purpose. The body B beds down about 6 in. lower than the upper moulding of the base F ; sides (9 in. wide), front (19 in. wide), and back of which are rebated together and blocked. All mouldings are, of course, mitred round sides and front only. The door B (of y^-\\'m. stuff), is rebated to shut on to front, frame, and projects J4 i n only. The moulding and carved fans at C might be further embellished by an -London, whose name is engraved on the dial between V. and VII. and over the figures registering the date of the month. A minute dial occupies the upper portion -of the main dial, which is entirely of brass, the numeral disc being raised about an eighth of an inch above the central portion. The minutes are numbered throughout the circumference over the hours, and these latter are divided by fleur-de-lis. The hands are of beautiful design in steel, and the clock case is in oak. The ball -terminals are gilt, and screw into little wooden bases, as shown. At either angle beyond the dial are spandrels of cast-brass ornament in coarse style, representing two cupids bearing crossed sceptres and supporting a regal crown. The screw which fixes this ornament has a Tudor rose for its head, and forms the center of the composition. -The object, in the present design, is to make a corner chair capable of affording support to the shoulders; and in this respect the design annexed is somewhat original. The selection of the wood for same is a matter of taste; black walnut, mahogany (stained dark), rosewood, or dull black are all suitable. To save expense, it might, moreover, be made without the underframing or listing shown, although the strength would be reduced without it. But our purpose for the moment is, \"how to make,\" and a few practical hints may be useful on that point. The first business is to produce the moulds to working drawing shown, and as an inch scale is adopted, this should be a simple matter. Then get out the four legs — i. e., two long and two short. The two long legs must be out of 2 in. wood, to allow of throw over scroll at top; iy 2 in. wood will do nicely for the short ones. The seat rails must be 2 in. solid wood, and beech cannot be used except for blocking, as all the wood is more or less seen. The back might be i)A in. wood, to allow, when the top is glued on, for shaping back and front to bring it in a line with the top. The top would take a piece of 4^2 in. wood, to allow for sweep. Of course where several chairs are made, the tops can be marked one into the other, and thus waste of timber avoided ; 1 J4 m wood will be stout enough for the arms and brackets. The splat -Drawer Making and Fitting. It is often said that a man who can make and fit a drawer well can make almost anything in constructive -woodwork. This is probably true, with some reservations, for it is generally accepted as a good test of a man\\'s skill, and we have no doubt that beginners find it one of the most difficult things to tackle, especially in the preparation and \"setting out.\" The general method is as follows, applied to an average sized drawer: — Carefully select the stuff — i. e., y 2 in., finishing Y% in., for sides and back ; Y% in. or %. in. for the bottom, and I in., to finish % in. or J4 in., for the front. All the stuff should be dry and clean, as well as straight and even in the grain, and each piece must be planned up true and gauged to an equal thickness. Care must be -A handy and general workshop method is shown in Figs. 172 and 173, marked on the front of the drawer, -and the back of the back, and (2) on the front end of the sides. These marks indicate the outside and bottom edge of each piece, as well in the giving the number; and if this simple rule is applied there should be no mistake made. Where a set of drawers are the same depth, the same number should be written on the bearer or carcase. In all cases an allowance must be made on the width and length of the front and sides for fitting, and l /$ in. is ample for this ; but the sides can be squared on the shooting board at each end to the length required. It is never a good plan to let a drawer stop on to the back of a job, so the sides should be at least j4 in. or J4 in. less in length than the inside of the carcase. -After preparing the stuff, the next job is to fit it. Carefully joint one end of the front, and fit it to the corresponding end of the opening ; then mark off length -at the other end, and fit tightly in the same, but leave the top edge until the final fit of the drawer. Then \"run\" or fit the sides in — remembering the marks — taking care they fit tight from end to end, and then plane the ends of the back to fit the opening in the same way as the front. The stuff is now ready for gauging and the cutting gauge is the best of the two to use. Gauge the lap on the ends of the front first (see distance A on Fig. 174), and then on both sides of the front ends of the sides (see A, Fig. 175). Then set the gauge to the thickness of the sides, and strike a line from the ends on the inside face of the front (see B, Fig. 174) ; and this same line must be gauged from the end and on both sides of the back. Lastly, the thickness of the back must be gauged in a like manner from the back ends of the sides. It will be noted that, even if a dozen drawers are to be made, the gauge is shifted only three times, and only twice if the back is the same thickness as the sides, which should always happen when the wood is obtainable. In gauging the thicknesses, care must be taken to set the gauge a little under, but never over, or a bad fit is bound to follow. It also might happen that the best planed stuff will \"cast,\" and the sides may cast hollow in the length; whenever this does occur the round side should always be put outside. -The stuff is now ready for setting out and cutting the dovetails. Men of experience are able to just mark -off distances and cut the dovetails quickly and regularly. To those who are less skilled and beginning, a good and simple method is shown in Fig. 176. On the front end of one of the sides square down — with pencil — the lines 1 and 2, % in. from each edge, and then divide the space between these lines for the required number of dovetails. The lines will then become the center of the pins. To set out the dovetails, mark i-i6th in. each side of the line at the top and l /$ in. at the bottom; join these points, and the dovetails are given. The same method can be adopted on the fronts if the holes are to be cut first. There are various methods and many opinions as to which should be done first, but the safest course is to use the one you know and can best apply to the work at hand. We know of no simpler way of setting out dovetails than the one explained ; and it will be noted that the half pin on the outside is left strong enough, whilst the spacing of the pins is regular and at a suitable angle. -In many cases when a drawer sticks it will be found that the place in which it slides, or ought to slide, is the part that requires most attention. -A drawer to run well must be perfectly parallel back and front all around, except that the sides and top and bottom may be eased off to the extent of 1/16 in. to }£ in. at the extreme ends, this easing off to extend to about y 2 in. from the end. For small drawers much less will be sufficient; large drawers may have a little more taken off. -The runners, that is, the wood against which the drawer slides in its receptacle, should not be quite parallel, but a little wider at the back, or the drawer will never run well. Here again it is impossible to give exact measurements. A drawer 1 ft. wide, 6 in. high, and 1 ft. 6 in. long would require the space at the back to be about % in. wider and higher than the front. -One great fault with drawers is that they \"wind,\" that is, if placed on a perfectly flat table, all four corners will not touch the level surface. This is most difficult to rectify. The cause may be bad workmanship or unseasoned wood which has twisted in drying. The high parts may be planed off, but then the drawer will be small, and must be made up to its proper size by gluing on strips of wood ; or the receptacle may be reduced in size. The latter is usually the easier to do. -Suppose that the top long drawer of the 4-ft. chest of drawers which has stuck half-way is to be rectified. Do not use too much force in pulling the handles, or they may come off, or the whole front come away from the sides. Unscrew the back from the carcase, and while a helper pulls at the handles, gently tap the ends at the back with a hammer, a piece of wood being interposed endwise of the grain to act as a punch. Take care to hit the end of the drawer that is farthest in. If this does not move the drawer, it may be necessary to remove the partition between the drawers by sliding it out, and then the runners at the sides of the carcase, by gently prising them out, first previousl yremoving the screws if necessary. -The drawer must be badly jammed if it still remains fixed, and removal to a warmer room had better be tried, and a little time allowed before resorting to stronger measures. -When the drawer is removed, first replace the partition and runners, and ascertain whether the latter are wider apart at the back than at the front. This is best done by cutting a strip of wood the exact length of the opening of the front, and sliding it to the back. If not, the runners must be reduced. Or it may happen that there is no runner, or that it has been forced out of place. -Having got the runners parallel, except for the little play mentioned, next see that they are straight from -back to front; the sides of the carcase may have bulged and bent them. Afterwards do the top and bottom in a similar way. Before and during the process of adjustment, see that the runners do not wind with the front. This can be ascertained by placing the eye about 3 in. from the front of the bottom rail on which the drawer slides and level with it, and observing that the runner ends are in the same plane, by looking first at one end and then the other without moving the eye. This requires practice, and is termed \"taking it out of wind.\" Repeat the process for the under side of the top rail, and adjust the runners as required. -Having got the carcase right, next examine the drawer itself for winding, and whether it is parallel and straight from back to front. If the sides bulge, they can sometimes be knocked in a little. If not, the surplus must be planed off, first making a pencil mark where the parts are not to be planed. -Now try the drawer to see if it will run in. If it goes half way, take off a little with a plane (or scraper if the wood is hard) where it is tight. Run it in and out several times, and see where it shines, and carefully remove the shine. Avoid taking any off the edge of the front as long as possible, or it will be too small and a bad fit. In shutting or opening a well-fitting drawer, a little friction should be felt for the whole length. -The sides and top and bottom edges should next be well smoothed with middle and fine sand paper until -they shine. Finally they and the runners should be rubbed with spermaceti wax, and then with a linen rag, using plenty of pressure. Spermaceti sometimes crumbles away when used. If so, melt it at a low heat in a jar, pour into a cardboard box, and keep it there, cutting down the edges as required. Nothing need be added when using on wood ; but for the joints of brass mathematical instruments, add 10 per cent of vaseline. -Veneering which we will first deal with, consists of laying an expensive or highly figured wood upon a foundation of a cheaper or more common wood. It does not always meet with approval, the prevailing idea being that if a piece of cabinet-work is veneered it is cheap; but a moment\\'s consideration would convince the most incredulous that the finest effects in the works are to be obtained only by this process. It is a fact also that veneering gives greater strength to articles of furniture than if they were solidly made. Among the valuable woods for the purpose many are obtained from the far East, even the remote Siam and the Philippines furnishing supplies. Some of the most exquisitely colored and figured woods are only obtainable in small pieces, and are used for ornamental inlay designs, in devising and applying which the Hollanders are so expert that cabinets, tables, desks and other articles thus treated by them are imported here and find ready sale. -The best figured and most ornamental wood is usually to be found at the butt end of the tree, though good mottle may be obtained at the junction of the trunk and limbs. In buying timber for veneering purposes, only long experience can determine its quality and worth ; the external appearance is not always a true index of the internal, and it is often a matter of chance, -\"Sawn.\" — This term is applied to all veneers that are cut by saw. The log is placed upon a travelling platform, the fine saws being set in a vertical frame and cutting the veneers simultaneously through the log. The usual number of veneers to the inch is ten, but, if desired, twelve may be obtained; the latter are, however, thin, and not so serviceable. The veneers are numbered consecutively, so that \"match\" veneers may easily be determined. The ends should be bound with muslin to prevent splitting. Veneers to be in proper workable order must be kept in a damp place; they are then much more pliable, and less liable to crack. The waste of timber in cutting by this method is, roughly speaking, about $i of an inch per inch of thickness. -\"Knife-cut.\" — By this method there is no waste whatever. The log, having been opened up, is steamed, and, while saturated with moisture, placed under the knife. This works horizontally, and takes off the thinnest shaving possible. The usual number of veneers obtained per inch of thickness is from thirty-six to forty ; they are therefore almost as thin as paper, and not at all reliable for hard wear or subsequent scraping and repolishing. Knife-cut veneers should only be used on -those parts of a job that are not liable to constant wear; the only advantage — and that a doubtful one — which they possess is that the veneer will \"lie\" more readily upon a sweep or on the flat owing to its thinness, and -with a reduction in time there is a corresponding abatement in price. Apart from economic reasons, a \"sawn\" veneer should always be used. -Veneering. — Any wood is suitable for veneering upon, but those usually selected are of the \"bay-wood\" or pines. The foundation, having been faced up, is \"toothed\" by a special hand plane, thus imparting a rough surface to the wood which will enable the glue to adhere more firmly. A solution of size and water used hot is next applied and allowed to dry. The heart side of a board should always be veneered upon, and the -reverse side damped with water to prevent the board going round when sized. Lay the board face down until ready for veneering. The veneer may now be laid, and can be done in two ways — by hand or machine. -For small works, mouldings, or sweeps, use the former method ; for panels, carcase ends, etc., the latter. -Process i. — Quickly brush over with hot glue, taking care to spread it evenly. The veneer may then be laid down, pressed by hand to remove the air, and squeezed down by means of a \"caul,\" removing all blisters and superfluous glue. A weighted board then should be placed on the job until the following day. -In the case of sweeps, either a steel bow-cramp contracted to the shape, or a wooden template secured by means of cramps, should be used. -this purpose is shown at Fig. 172 and comprises an iron framework with perforated cast top, a series of gasburners running at intervals of 9 inches or so the length of the machine, and over this an iron plate covered by a sheet of zinc. The gas having been turned on and the plate heated, the job to be veneered is laid on the machine, and cramps are then placed across and tightened down by means of set-screws, until the air between the foundation and the veneer is excluded, and -the superfluous glue squeezed out. This may be easily ascertained by a tap on the panel, a hollow sound indicating that the veneer is not bedded. When the veneer has been laid, turn off the gas and leave the job to cool naturally, say, through the night, the cramps remaining -on. After standing for three days, the work may be finished off. It will be found that some of the glue has oozed through the pores of the veneer, while a general roughness is apparent. Proceed with an ordinary iron scraper or iron plane to smooth down (the latter is better if the veneer is thick enough, as the scraper may get too warm and soften the glue beneath), and finish with sand-paper upon a cork rubber. The job is then ready for the polisher. -The butt-joint (Fig. 178) is a most effective way of veneering a drawerfront or panel. Take two \"match\" veneers — that is, consecutive members — as cut from the log, cut through each where it is desired to butt, thus -making them \"rights\" and \"lefts,\" the figure falling equally from the central joint. The veneer is then laid upon the foundation, and a few needle points or tacks placed on each side the joint, a strip of brown paper being glued upon the same to hold it in position. When dry, lay as before described. -Fig. 179. — A more elaborate way of panelveneering is to use four match veneers quartered. All the joints must be pasted. -Fig. 180. — Still more elaborate is the addition of cross-banding, which is laid by hand after the center is completed. -Fig. 181. — The addition of a stringing is often advantageous to break the line of junction and throw up the center, a narrow band of the veneer being removed for this purpose by means of a cutting gauge. -Fig. 182. — If there is a defect or hole in a veneer, a new piece should be inserted matching the curl or mottle of the wood, the edges of which should be cut to the shape of the curl or follow the line of the grain. If this is done, detection is almost impossible; on no account insert a square piece, as the hard lines thus produced are most objectionable. -This most important branch of the wood-working trade seldom gets the attention it deserves, the common idea being that there is nothing in polishing demanding skill or judgment, or even worth the trouble of knowing. No greater mistake than this could be made. Polishers have in their hands the making or marring of the finished piece of furniture from the cabinet-maker\\'s bench. Briefly, the process of Frenchpolishing consists in the application of various gums, lacs, etc., dissolved in spirit, in order to give to the wood a surface or polish (bright or dull as required) which not only preserves the wood, but brings out the beauty of the grain. -Workshop and Fittings. — The workshop should be a large well-ventilated building, with a north light for preference and also top lights. It should be kept heated to a given temperature, say 60 degrees F , and be maintained at this heat night and day. Hot-water pipes around the walls, with regulating valves, will probably give the best results; steam-pipes may be used, but do not maintain such an equable temperature. A small enclosed coke-stove or gas-burner is an essential for the purpose of melting wax, obtaining hot water, etc. -The room should be free from dust, as any particles floating in the air and settling on a job in process, are bound to be worked up into it, producing a cloudy ef-feet. There should also be a smaller room leading from the main shop for \"Fumigating;\" this must be air-tight, and have a pane of glass inserted in one of the upper panels of the door for observation purposes. -Trestles are required varying in height from 9 inches to 30 inches, and loose tops of different lengths and widths for placing on them. Several wooden battens covered with felt to protect a job are also necessary. -Materials. — It need hardly be said that upon the quality of the materials used in polishing depends very largely the ultimate results, good or bad. And here, as in other branches of trade, the best is always the cheapest. It will be found a mistake to lay in too much stock, as polish quickly evaporates and other materials deteriorate, but rather to buy small quantities of lac, spirit, &c, and mix fresh as required. -Not much in the way of plant is needed to fit a polishing shop : — say, half a dozen pint (and a few larger) stoppered bottles for polish, glaze, finish, varnish, &c. ; a few jars of stain, oil, fillers; and tin canisters for keeping rubbers, more valued by the polisher than any part of his kit. -How to make a rubber. — Get a piece of clean white or gray wadding, remove the skin from it, and roll it into an Qgg shape, then cover the same with a thin linen rag strained tightly over the wadding, holding the ends in the palm of the hand, the two forefingers and thumb bedding themselves on the extremity of the rubber, flat-ten the under side or polishing surface, and you will have an oval flat of, say, 3 by 2 inches. The proper size of the rubber depends upon the polisher himself and the class of work engaged on. -If new linen or calico prints be used, they should be washed to remove all trace of lime or dressing, and be as soft and pliable as possible. A different rubber should be used for different polishes, and they are so easy and inexpensive to make, there is no reason why work should be clouded through dirty rubbers. Cleanliness and good polishing go hand in hand. When the rubber is finished with, it should be kept in an air-tight canister. It will thus keep soft, and may be used repeatedly. Failure to do this will result in hardness, which renders it useless. We are now ready to commence work and proceed to the first page, viz : — -Filling-in. — This consists of coating the surface of the wood with a filler, which closes or fills up the grain, thus making it possible to get a perfectly smooth surface for polishing and also saving time and material in the afterwork. Upon the efficiency of the filling-in depends the result of the finished job. There are many good fillers on the market, any one of which might be equally well adopted, but it is much better that the polisher should make his own polishes, &c, and many men prefer to do so. Consequently no two polishers use exactly the same formula, but work upon receipts best adapted to their own particular style. Before filling-in, the work -should be as finely papered down as possible. Too much stress cannot be laid on this point, for if well done at first much after-labor will be saved. The filler can then be put on with a flannel, and rubbed into the grain of the wood until the pores are filled up, then wipe all off and paper down. This will be found necessary, because the filler will have raised the grain. When dry, the work will be ready for the next process, bodying-up. -The following fillers will be found useful. The exact proportions can be ascertained when mixing, remembering that the filler must just be of the consistency to work freely. -Fillers. — (i) Spirit varnish laid on with a brush; this forms a good quick filler. Two coats should be given. -(2) Size. — Ordinary glue size may be used as a filler in the case of hard-grained wood, and will answer the purpose. -(4) Whiting and Linseed-oil. — Mix these together into a paste and apply with a flannel. This is a filler generally adopted. -The disadvantage in Nos. 3 and 4 is that there is a great liability to get the job greasy, which will afterwards work its way through the polish, giving the surface a cobweb effect which is known as \"sweating.\" -and apply to the job, and rub off as quickly as possible. This filler is undoubtedly the cleanest and most effectual that can be used, and entirely obviates \"sweating.\" -(6) Whiting and Turpentine. — Mix into a paste, and apply as before. This is preferred by many to No. 5. -Thus far these fillers are in the white, and suitable only for such woods as ash, maple, satinwood, birch, &c. In the case of dark-colored woods the filler should be tinted with rose-pink or Venetian red ; ebonized work, lamp-black; oak, walnut woods, &c, chromes, ochres, and umbers according to the tone required. -Bodying-up. — We now come to the second stage of polishing. The wood having been papered down with fine old glass paper, take a rubber, previously described, and sprinkle a little polish onto it from the stock bottle ; then cover over with a rag, holding the ends tightly in the palm of the hand, and tap the rubber against the palm of the other hand, which will cause the polish to distribute itself over the whole rubber; put a spot of linseed-oil on with the finger, and the rubber is ready for work. Commence very lightly at one corner of the work, if it be a panel or carcase end, and by a series of motions forming interlacing curves, gradually work over the entire surface, never lifting the rubber until at the edge of the job. Care must be taken not to have the rubber too full of polish, or to press on the work too hard, in which case the polish will ooze out of the rubber and leave nasty ridges on the job ; the idea is how -best to cover the entire work evenly. Having done this, let the job stand as long as possible — a few days will do no harm, — -the shellac will then have sunk into the wood, the spirit evaporating. This will present a dull appearance, and feel rough to the touch. We then proceed to paper down again, in fact too much stress cannot be placed upon the value of judicious sand-papering. After this the operation is repeated until a good body of polish is obtained on the work. Be very sparing of using oil; though this eases the rubber, it ruins the \\'job ultimately. After another papering or pumice-stoning down we can pass to the final stage, spiriting-off. It may be asked, how many times is it necessary to go over the work ? This very much depends on the wood worked upon. It will be anything from three to six times, the object being to obtain a body, hard and that will not sink. Much of the modern work is completely ruined to-day because it is \"rushed.\" Time is not allowed between the rubbers, consequently no proper foundation is obtained, and in six months\\' time the job requires redoing. The method described above will apply equally to either light, or dark woods, the difference being in the polish used rather than the method. Spiriting-off. — This process may be called the most difficult portion of French-polishing, and when once proficient in this a man may be said to know his trade. The process is similar to bodying-up, with this exception, that towards the last \"spirits\" only are used on -the rubber. This has the effect of polishing the \"lac\" put on during bodying-up, and giving to the work a fine, hard, bright surface ; the oil previously worked in is spirited out. -Commence by using, say, two parts of polish to one of spirit, then equal parts, afterwards two of spirit to one of polish, and thus gradually reducing the polish to nil, and using only pure spirit. The rubber and motions are as previously described. A clean rubber should be used when pure spirit only is used, and a series of straight motions taken instead of the circular ones, running the same direction as the grain of the wood. -Small mouldings, angles, awkward corners, &c, which would be very difficult to spirit off in the ordinary way, may be done by \"glazing.\" Applied with a rubber and worked straight along the moulds, this glaze quickly dries, and has the same appearance as if spirited-off. It is, however, softer, and will not stand wear. Much of this work could be obviated if the polisher were given the job in pieces; for instance, mouldings mitred around panels should be polished in long lengths, and cut and fitted afterwards, thus avoiding nasty corners. Turned work is better polished in the lathe, before being framed up. Panels should be polished before framing up, or if beaded in, left loose for that purpose. -difficulty in mixing polishes, and every man should be able to do so, the process simply consisting in dissolving shellac in methylated spirit. This latter should be bought at 60 over-proof, stored in a cool place, and tightly sealed, as it soon evaporates. -Shellac is orange in color; the lighter the color the purer the quality. It is in small flakes, and requires crushing before dissolving in the spirits. This would be used for ordinary polish. If, however, a clear or white polish is desired, then bleached shellac is used. This is in lumps, and must be crushed before using. This lac must be kept in water. Coloring pigments can be added to any polish to intensify it as desired, such as Bismarck or Vandyke brown. These polishes should be mixed cold — the shellac will take a little longer to dissolve, but the operation is much safer, — then strain through muslin, and put in stoppered bottles. -Brown Polish. — (1) 1 pint methylated spirit, 4 oz. orange shellac, Yi oz. sandarac; or (3) 1 pint methylated spirit, 4 oz. orange shellac, y 2 oz. sandarac, 94 oz. benzoin. -Glaze. — 1 pint methylated spirits, 6 oz. benzoin, Yi oz. of sandarac can be added for harding purposes. -preparations which are used to restore furniture which has already been polished, but has through neglect or other cause become cloudy. The first thing to be done in a case of this kind is to thoroughly wash the woodwork with a flannel soaped with curd soap and warm water; by this means all dirt and grease will be removed. After wiping down with a soft dry duster, apply one or other of the following revivers, and polish off with another clean duster. Much of the old polish will thus be brought back. -Reviver No. i. — Take equal parts of methylated spirit, linseed-oil, and malt vinegar. Mix well and shake before using. -Reviver No. 2. — Turpentine, 1 quart ; bees\\'-wax, V\\\\ lb. ; curd soap, 2 oz. ; water, 1 quart. Dissolve the bees\\'wax in the turpentine by moderate heat ; shred the curd soap in the water and boil ; then while both are hot mix together. This will set in a light paste, and prove an excellent polisher. -Repairs. — When a bruise has to be made good upon a job the best plan to adopt is as follows : — Raise the bruise by means of a hot iron placed upon a damp cloth. This, unless the wood is broken, will lift it to its original level, it may then be sand-papered off and polished. -Bleaching. — It sometimes happens that some parts of the wood are darker than the rest, in which event it is most important that the darker parts be reduced to -the lighter. This result is produced by bleaching. Dissolve i oz. of oxalic acid in half a pint of water, and apply with a rag; when dry, paper down, and if the density is not sufficiently reduced, repeat the operation until the desired result is obtained. -Sweating-out. — When too much oil has been used on the job, the surface presents a cobweb appearance which gradually increases and eats the polish away. When first detected, it may be removed with warm water, soap, and flannel; but when of long standing, nothing can be done to remove it except repolishing. -This is the process of treating oak with ammonia, darkening it by this means to any required shade. This result can be achieved in two ways. -(1st.) Natural fumigation, that is, exposing the oak work in a sealed chamber to the fumes of ammonia until the required density is obtained. -The ammonia used should be a solution of ammonia gas in water, and should have a specific gravity of 880. This must, on account of its volatile nature, be kept in a well-stoppered bottle. -Process 1. — To fumigate by this means a separate chamber is required. This may be an ordinary room or a fuming-cabinet built in the corner of the polishing shop. In either case it must be air-tight, and the door opening into it should have a square of glass for observation purposes. When the oak work has been placed within it, take, say 1 pint of ammonia and fill about a dozen saucers placed upon the floor. The door must then be closed, and sealed up by means of brown paper pasted round the joints. The process of fuming then begins, and can be watched through the glass until the desired shade is obtained. The smaller the chamber the quicker will the work be done; the time may vary from six to twelve hours according to the strength -of the ammoniated atmosphere. Practice alone will determine the time for opening the chamber. This is the only reliable and safe way of fumigating; in fact all other processes are but imitations of it, and the product of \"cheapness and rush.\" -The advantages of this process are : ( i ) that as no liquid touches the job the grain is not raised, consequently sand-papering is avoided; (2) the ammonia fumes penetrate deeper into the wood than by outward application; (3) the exact density can be more easily determined. -The disadvantages are : ( 1 ) This process requires a separate room for the purpose; (2) It takes much more time than is required by the direct application of ammonia. -In connection with natural fuming it will be noticed that some parts of the job may not \"take\" at all. This often arises from the fact that various oaks have been used in its construction. Thus \"Oak grown in one part of America may be susceptible to the fumes, while oak grown in another state, will not.\" Those parts which have not \"taken\" must then be treated by Process 2, and care must be exercised that the resultant color may be the same. Let the ammonia for this purpose be very weak. Let it dry before applying another coat (if necessary), as it is much easier to intensify than to bleach, and nothing looks worse than a patchy job. -Process 2. — This consists in the application of liquid ammonia (.880 spec, grav.) direct on to the work. It is usually applied with a sponge or rag. Water may be added to weaken the solution if only a light tint is desired. The wood immediately darkens upon the surface, but allowances should be made for its drying lighter. The objection to this process is that it raises the grain, which entails sand-papering down, while process No. 1 does not. This necessarily takes away much of the sharpness of the mouldings, the fillets suffering most of all. In this case it will be found that the work does not take the dye evenly, and the same shading or toning to a color will be found necessary to produce a good result. -In either process the job should be in the white, that is, without brass or copper work or silvered plates, as these are liable to be affected by the ammonia fumes. -Finishing. — The work, having been fumed by either of the foregoing processes, is now ready for finishing, and the usual way is either of the following: — (1) Egg-shell finish ; (2) Wax finish. -(1) Apply a thin rubber of ordinary polish to the job, and dull down with powdered pumice-stone and a stiff brush. This will give a dull shine without in any way filling the grain of the wood. (2) Dissolve pure bees\\'-wax in turpentine, and apply with a rag, rubbing well in, and obtaining a polish by \"elbow grease.\" This is a more tedious process than the former, but much -more satisfactory, as this process can be carried on after the job has left the polisher\\'s hands and the polish will constantly improve. -Mahogany is the only other wood that will \"fume.\" It assumes a purple tint, and should be treated in the same manner as oak. -This method of producing a polish was undoubtedly the earliest adopted by cabinetmakers, and is best suited to the finishing of dark oak, chestnut, and some other woods. The advantage appears to consist in the fact that the process is never complete, and, like Tennyson\\'s \"Brook,\" may go on forever. Much of the beauty of a piece of sixteenth-century carved oak is due to the polishing, — the result of years of rubbing — by use. -In wax-polishing two ingredients only are necessary, bees\\'-wax and turpentine. The wax should be melted, and sufficient turpentine added to form an easy workable paste ; do not heat the turpentine or pour it into the melted wax while the latter is still on the fire, as it is highly inflammable. As all the turpentine must evaporate before the polishing is complete — leaving the wax to act as both filler and polisher, — no more should be added at the commencement than necessary, otherwise the work will be prolonged. If the stock sets hard it can be softened again by warming, but it is better to mix it in small quantities as required. The safest method of warming or melting all ingredients in the polish-shop is by steam, using a kettle or double pan, such as the cabinet-makers use for glue. This point is one not lost sight of by insurance companies. -In applying the wax-polish no skill is required, but \"elbow-grease\\'\\' and patience are absolutely necessary. -We will suppose that we are polishing an oak wainscoting, which has been previously fumed and stained. If the latter, we shall rub down with ^sand-paper; if the former, this will be unnecessary. By means of a flannel boss we apply the wax-polish, rubbing the panels in circular motion till every part receives an equal polish. The work may now with advantage be laid aside until the next day, when the process may be repeated. Let \"a little and often\" be the motto, — a little, in order that no clogging of wax occurs in the corners and mouldings, all the wax being rubbed in until an even bright surface is obtained, free from all tackiness or finger marking ; and often, so that each thin coat may have a chance to sink into the grain and by the evaporation of the turpentine harden. Remember that the polish is produced not by the amount of wax used but by \"elbow-grease.\" -If preferred, a piece of felt glued to a wooden block may be used ; a stiff flat bristle brush is often used for polishing a carved panel or turned work. -Thus far we have spoken of wax-polishing as applied to oak, and it is questionable whether it can be applied with equal success to other woods ; stained ash is perhaps the next best wood to oak for this method of polishing. -Floors are often treated in this way, including parquet surrounds, plain stained surrounds, or entire floors. Hard-wood floors are usually without previous -staining, as each polishing darkens the floor until a rich tone results. The method is as previously described, except that for floors a box-polisher is used, which is weighted. This is a wooden case (say) 12x8x6 inches, weighted inside with iron or lead to 14 lbs, ; attached to this is a handle 6 feet long, working on a swivel, and thus allowing a sweep of 6 feet or so in each direction, in other words a clear swing of 12 feet or more. Upon the bottom of this case tack a piece of clean felt and proceed to polish. -The wax must previously have been rubbed on the floor with a flannel, and the first part of the polishing done with a weighted brush having a surface of 12x8 inches, and fitted with a swinging handle. This will evenly spread the wax and take up all superfluous quantities; it will also produce a certain amount of polish which can afterwards be brought up to a great brilliancy by the finishing felt polisher. This method would also be used in preparing the floor of a ballroom, which might afterwards be kept in condition by the sprinkling and rubbing-in of French chalk. -If wax polishing was the original method of treating oak, it may be said with equal truth that oil-polishing was the method of finishing mahogany in. the days when French-polishing was unknown; in fact, it is questionable whether any of the seventeenth and eighteenth-century work was dealt with in any other manner. Chippendale, Sheraton, and their contemporaries certainly adopted it as best suited to their work, and the untouched jobs handed down prove their decision to have been right. -The great objection to oil-polishing is the length of time required to produce a good result; in fact, the longer you go on, the better it is. This fact has in these days of speed completely put oil-polishing in the background; the manufacturer wants a speedy return for his capital, and the public require their furniture the day after they give the order, so that it is impossible to have a job in the polisher\\'s hands a month, and speedier methods have consequently been adopted. -It is unquestionable that oil-polishing will bring up the figure of mahogany and enrich its color better than any other method, and if time permits, it is, for large work (such as panelling, dadoes, doors, screens, counter tops, &c), the very best way of polishing. -upon the wood with raw linseed-oil, this being continually rubbed in with a flannel or felt pad. Let the operation be repeated day by day until a polish results. The process is, like wax-polishing, extremely tedious and laborious. Oil-polish can always be revived years afterwards by the same process, and a little judicious rubbing will keep the work constantly up to the mark. -The rage for effect at low cost has necessitated the staining of white woods to imitate the more expensive ones, and the bulk of the so-called walnut or dark mahogany fittings are but the product of the polisher who, with dexterous hand, produces the required deception. The woods commonly used for stained work are birch, canary wood, yellow pine, and other woods. -Stains should be placed on the wood direct before any size or filling has been applied. They may be applied in warm or cold water, diluted to their proper strength. A sponge is the best medium, and care should be taken that the stain floods the wood equally. When dry, the work should be sand-papered carefully — as the wet stain raises the grain — and a smooth surface obtained, then proceed with the finishing off as previously described. Aniline dyes are much used, and can be obtained in any shade in addition to the following. Let the stain be weak ; it is easier to apply a second coat than lighten the first. -Walnut. — (i) Vandyke brown, J4 lb.; ammonia .880, 1 pint; water, 1 quart; (2) bichromate of potash, 4 oz. ; water, 1 quart. -Apply the stain to the wood with a sponge or rag, rubbing over the work until an even surface is obtained. Allow the stain to dry (which will raise the grain) then paper down, and proceed to finish by varnishing. This may be done in either oil or spirit, but the process is the same, except that for oil varnish a bristle brush may be used, while for spirit a camelhair brush is desirable. After the first coat by either method, the work should be rubbed down before a second or finishing coat is applied. If an extra fine surface is required, paper down again after the second coat, and apply a third. Oil varnish would be used for such work as would be exposed to the weather, spirit varnish for indoor or protected woodwork. -Spirit Varnish. — 1 lb. orange shellac, 6 oz. sandarac, 2 oz. hard resin, and 2 quarts meth. spirit. -Clear Spirit Varnish. — 8 oz. sandarac, 1 quart meth. spirit, }i pint of turpentine; this should stand and be strained through muslin to take out all sediment. -Spirit Varnish. — 1 / 2 lb. orange shellac, 1 oz. resin, 1 oz. sandarac, and 1 pint meth. spirit ; this makes a hard, quick-setting varnish. -In No. i, Fig. 183, is an illustration of a completed revolving book-case of the ordinary type. It stands 3 or 4 feet high, and is about 20 inches square. A plan of the base on which the book-case revolves is shown on No. 2. This is made of two pieces of wood 2^2 inches wide and i l /> inches thick. These are joined together by halving, and have rounded ends. Four castors are fixed at the base, one near each corner. The top is made of i l / 2 inch boards doweled together, and the edge moulded and a rebate cut on the under side. The top may also be made of a 3/2-inch board with a ij^-inch moulding fitted round the edge, and another J^-inch board fastened below, thus saving material and effecting lightness. No. 3 is a section of the book-case showing the details of construction of the top and bottom and the method of attaching the revolving part to the base, A being the top, B F and B F two of the laths which keep the books in position, and H the fixed base (shown in No. 2). The base of the revolving part is made of 1 ^2 -inch boards, C, which have a rebate cut round the lower edge to receive the i-inch plinth, D D, which is mitred at the corners and fastened into the rebate. The lower edge of the plinth is rebated and a thin board, E, fixed into it. -No. 4 is a perspective view of the frame to which the shelves are fastened. It is made of four boards of equal -width and thickness joined by grooves and overlapping so that a square tube is formed. These boards must be of such a width that, when fastened in their places, the -width of the frame is the same as that of the base, C (No. 3). The middle part of the frame should be i 1 /* inch longer than the rest, and fit into the center of C. Another way of fastening the shelves, which requires less material, is to make a square tube, and attach the shelves to this. . Strips of wood 2 or 3 inches wide are fastened along the top and bottom of each shelf in the -position in which the boards (No. 4) would come. These strips keep the books in position at one end of each row, and the laths (B F and B F, No. 3) at the other end. -The method of pivoting the revolving part is shown in No. 3. A circular pillar, I, is turned to fit the interior of the square tube,, and the lower end is turned down to form a pivot which fits the hole in the fixed base, H ; a little above the pivot a groove is cut in the pillar, forming a neck which works in a hole cut in a piece of i-inch board, G, which is attached to the -under side of C. This piece of wood is sawn in half, the two halves placed in position on the pillar, and then glued together again. The pillar extends to within about i foot of the top of the tube. A steel spindle, K, with a pointed top is screwed into the upper end, and -Fig. 183 this spindle pivots in the under side of a metal plate, L, which is attached to a block of wood, M. The latter should exactly fit the tube, and is attached to it by screws. -The revolving apparatus can also be made by fastening two or more castors or wheels to the lower side of the base. These castors roll over a metal plate fastened to the upper side of the fixed base. The latter is attached to the revolving part by a spindle, which passes through the frame and the base, and is secured by nuts. -When the top and bottom has been attached to the tube, and the shelves are in their places, the laths B F and B F (No. 3) are attached to the shelves, and also -essentially the same. Sometimes the revolving part is made shorter, and legs added to the fixed base. They are also made to contain only one tier of books, so that they can stand on the table. Fixed book-stands are also made with shelves arranged similarly to the revolving book-cases. -Chairs. — Although chairs have an infinite variety of form, as we have shown, they are constructed on nearly the same principles. No. i, Fig. 184, is an illustration of the framework of a chair suitable for a sitting-room. The hind part consists of two long pieces of squared stuff, to which are mortised two horizontal upper rails forming the back, a third at the level of the seat, and a fourth below. These back legs are usually curved backwards above and below the seat, so that the chairback has a slight slope and so that the feet are spread out sufficiently to prevent tilting. The front legs are joined by two rails, and are also fastened to the back by the same number. The tenons of the upper rails may come up. flush with the top of the leg, as shown in the illustration, or can be fitted into an ordinary mortise. The width of the rails at the level of the seat depends upon the nature of the upholstery; if springs are to be fitted, they are about three inches wide. The bottom rails are omitted in some chairs of heavy build, or the side pairs of legs are connected by rails and the middle of these joined by a cross-piece. -All the parts of bedroom chairs, with the exception of the backs, are, as a rule, turned. The two back legs project above the seat to form the back, and are joined by two horizontal bars, which are slightly curved and joined to the vertical pieces by shallow mortises cut -in the latter. The joint is further strengthened by screws passed from the front through counter-sunk holes, -the heads being afterwards covered by small turned beads glued in, or if the chair is to be painted, the holes can be filled with wooden plugs. The lower rails are turned, and their rounded ends fit into corresponding -holes bored in the legs, where they are secured by glue. Sometimes only the front legs are turned, the back legs -Figure 184a being left square and bent slightly outwards. The seats of such chairs are made of four flat pieces of wood -about I inch thick mortised together, the front and back pieces overlapping the other two, and the back piece being shorter than that at the front. The corners and edges are slightly rounded, and sometimes the front piece is curved, as are also the sides. The front legs fit into the holes bored in the under side of the seat, and the back legs are fitted to the seat by grooves y 2 inch deep cut in the former. Rounded backs are made by cutting the upper ends of the back legs to form part of a circle, and fitting across these a curved piece of wood. This is attached by mortise-and-tenon joints, or by dowels. The lower cross-bar is cut in a similar manner, so that, when the four are joined together, the back has the form of a segment of a circle or ellipse. -Drawing-room chairs are framed in a somewhat similar manner. Turned or fretted bars are sometimes inserted in the back, either horizontally or vertically, or part of the back is upholstered. The legs are squared, tapered, and slightly curved ; or they are also turned and fluted, or left plain and carved. -No. 2, Fig. 184, shows the frame work of an armchair. The only difference between this and No. 1 is that the back is higher, the seat larger, and four extra rails forming the arms are added. The latter may be upholstered, or not, according to the design of the chair; turned spindles are sometimes inserted between them and the seat. The back of the arm-chair is sometimes slightly curved, and the seat may be made -oak, the legs being square and tapering, the side and back rails flat, and the latter slightly curved. The wood may be darkened with ammonia, or stained darkgreen, and the seat upholstered in leather. The backs of chairs of this type are not upholstered, but are generally made with top and bottom rails, the intermediate -In office chairs and others of a similar type the four legs are mortised to the wooden seat, which is made slightly hollow towards the middle part. The curved back is made up of several pieces, which are cut to form a curve and mortised or doweled together. It is attached to the seat by a series of turned or square vertical bars fixed by mortises, the two at the ends in front being stouter than the others. An extra piece of curved wood with a rounded edge is sometimes fixed to the middle part of the top of the back to serve as a shoulder-rest. When the seat is made to swivel round, the legs bend inwards, and meet at a small block of wood faced with metal, upon which the seat revolves. Office chairs are sometimes slightly upholstered instead of being left altogether plain. -The framework of an easy-chair is almost the same as that of an arm-chair, but the side rails which support the seat are much wider, the legs are shorter and thicker, and the seat stretches farther back. The back is not so high, and is made to slope slightly. The space between the arms and seat may be left open, filled with carved or turned work, or covered with upholstery. Some settees are made after the manner of large easy-chairs, wide enough to contain two or three persons; the framework of such is the same, but the seat and back are strengthened by additional crosspieces. -Music Stools. — These are made either with a fixed top, or with a top that can be raised. The former have four legs and the top is round or square. The legs sometimes slope slightly outwards towards the feet to obtain greater stability. In the plainer kind of stool, -y 2 -\\'mch boards with moulded edges, and of round, square, or oblong shape. If round, it is turned on the lathe out of one piece. If it is to be upholstered, a ^-inch rebate is cut all round, and the upholstery is fastened to it with brass-headed nails and finished off with gimp. The legs are either square or turned, and are screwed into the under side -of the seat ; they are strengthened near the lower ends by turned cross-rails. The coarse screws cut at the top of the legs are not turned on the lathe when they are being shaped, but are made subsequently with the aid of a \"box-screw.\" This is a rectangular block of wood with a handle at either end, and pierced by a hole in which a female screw corresponding to the male screw is cut. The top end of the leg is turned down for about Ij4 or 2 inches till it fits into one end of the hole, when it is pushed in and turned round at the same time, the screw being cut by a small knife inside. This method of joining legs is only used for light pieces of furniture and fancy tables, the legs beingusually attached by mortise-and-tenon joints. -Stools with movable seats have a stout turned pillar to with three curved feet are fastened by mortise-andtenon joints, meeting it about 6 inches from the ground. The top of the pillar is cut off flat and a hole 9 inches deep bored down it. A steel female screw is fixed into this, and a corresponding male screw about 9 inches long is fastened to the under side of the top. The latter is always circular and upholstered. -Sofas and Settees. — The framework of a sofa is shown in No. 1, Fig. 185. The four legs, which are represented simply as square blocks of wood, are fitted to the front and back rails with mortise-and-tenon joints. The upper part where the mortises are cut is generally made pretty stout to ensure strength, and -any resulting clumsiness is concealed by the upholstery. The lower part is tapered, carved, or turned. The front and back rails are strengthened by an additional crosspiece placed midway, and a similar cross-piece is fitted to the back, which is otherwise similar to the arm of an easy-chair. A method of fastening the head of the sofa is shown in the illustration; it consists of two rails mortised to the front and back legs in a slanting position, and strengthened by two cross-pieces. These rails are generally carved, and the front edges of both moulded. The outside of the front rail may also be carved. The top rail of the back is sometimes curved downwards until it meets the back rail of the lower frame, being made of two or more pieces mortised or doweled together. The space between the two is sometimes rilled with turned bars. In order to obtain lightness, each pair of legs is sometimes joined by two slight rails placed 2 or 3 inches apart instead of by a solid rail. -The framework of the simple square settee is shown in No. 2, Fig. 185. As all the woodwork of this is usually hidden by upholstery which reaches nearly down to the floor, it is made of common wood and receives no high degree of finish. The four legs are turned at the lower end and left square at the upper. The four rails which form the seat are mortised into the sides of the legs, as are also the three rails which form the back and ends. -The back can be further strengthened, if necessary, by inserting two diagonal bars. These settees are made in a great variety of forms, from that above described to the lighter and more elegant pieces of furniture which are embellished with turned work and only partly upholstered. Sometimes the four legs which form the end-pieces are turned and the seat-frame inserted in notches cut in these, and so upholstered that the lower part of the latter and all the legs are visible. -Settees for billiard-rooms are framed similarly to arm-chairs (see No. 2, Fig. 184). They are generally made about 6 or 7 feet long, and either straight or bent to suit corners. The woodwork of a billiard-room settee is shown in Fig. 186. The parts are more massive than those of ordinary settees. The legs are made of 3-in. scantling, those at the front being turned, whilst the other pair are bent slightly backwards. The settee stands on a platform about 8 inches high, and of such and sides. The two front corners of the platform are slightly rounded. When the settee is not intended to be placed on a platform, the legs are made longer and a foot-rest is fastened to the front about 6 inches from the floor. This is made of i-inch stuff with rounded edges ; it is fastened at the back into grooves cut in the front legs, and in front is supported on stout turned feet. -Seats for railway-stations, waiting-rooms, public offices, &c, are made in the same manner as billiard-or settle in darkened oak, suitable for a hall. The sides are made of ij/2 or 2-inch stuff, and grooves are cut in them to receive the seat, which is the same thickness. The seat is y 2 inch less in width than the sides, and comes up flush at the front, thus leaving a space Yi inch wide for the back. It may be attached to the sides by cutting at each end a rounded tenon 2 inches wide. These tenons project about ij^ inch through mortises cut in the end-pieces. Half-round holes are cut through these projecting pieces so that they are flush with the sides. When the seat is in its place, a peg made by cutting a piece of tapering turned wood in a longitudinal -direction is hammered in tight. This is shown in the illustration, and holds the sides and seat firmly together. To form the back, two horizontal rails are dovetailed to the sides, one at the bottom and the other at the top. The inner edges of these are grooved to fit a series of vertical boards, which are J^ inch thick and chamfered at the edges. The top edge of the settle is moulded or left square. -Some settles are made five or six feet high. The back of these is upholstered for about 3 feet above the seat, and the remainder of the space is filled with solid or fretted panels. A narrow shelf for china, &c, is sometimes fixed near the top. -Settles (No. 2, Fig. 187) are sometimes made of only two end-pieces and a seat. The former are made of 1 y* -inch oak, cut to any suitable shape. Settles of this kind serve as seats or for holding large pieces of china. -Another kind of settle which is very suitable for halls, has a seat 4 or 5 feet wide, and arms at the ends. The lower part forms a box, and is 1 foot deep, the lid being the seat. The sides and back are similar to those of an arm-chair. The four legs are usually of 2-inch scantling; the two back legs project above the seat and are joined by two horizontal i-inch rails, one at the top and the other nearly at the level of the seat. Two rails, which are fitted with panels, join each pair of legs and form the sides of the box. Panels of ^ -inch stuff are grooved to these. The framing of the lid is formed of -i-inch stuff, and is 2 or 3 inches wide. This kind of settle may be left plain, or finished with flat or chip carving. -Settles which are intended for drawing-rooms are similar in structural details to those made for the hall, but they are much lighter, and the greater part of the back and sides is upholstered. Many are fitted with a narrow shelf at the top, and the back is curved instead of being square. -Staining is the process of imparting to the surface of wood a color different from its natural one. It consists of two varieties, surface-staining and body-staining. In the former, as the name implies, the staining is effected by various compounds in the nature of pigments, laid upon the surface like paint, and forming a thin opaque coating, which does not, to any considerable degree, affect the fibre of the wood. In the latter the changes are chemical, the stain being usually applied as a thin wash, which, entering the pores of the wood, colors it to some depth below the surface. Staining requires no preliminary preparation, the stain being applied directly to the wood. As most stains raise the grain of the wood to a considerable extent, it is necessary before applying the varnish, to sand-paper the wood enough to render the grain quite smooth; this sometimes renders a second coat necessary, after which the sand-paper must be again applied. -A Good Black Stain. — I. Gall-nuts coarsely broken, 2 ounces; rain water, i quart; boil until reduced onehalf. 2. White vinegar, I pint ; iron filings, 2 ounces ; antimony (powdered) 2 ounces; vitriol, i ounce; logwood, a small handful. Infuse in bottle eight days, tying the cork down. To stain a piece of wood, give the wood a coating of No. i, which acts as a mordant; -Another. — Boil y 2 lb. of chip logwood in 2 quarts of water, add 1 oz. of pearl-ash, and apply it hot to the work with a brush; then take y> lb. of logwood, boil it as before in 2 quarts of water, and add y 2 oz. of verdigris and y 2 oz. of copperas; strain it off, put in y 2 lb. of rusty steel filings, and with this go over the work a second time. -Another. — Boil the extract of logwood in water, and to it add slowly a little of the yellow prussiate of potash. Brush on hot. -Another. — Boil 1 lb. logwood in 4 quarts of water; add a double handful of walnut-peel or shells, boil it up again, take out the chips, add a pint of the best vinegar and it will be fit for use ; apply hot. This will be improved by applying over the first stain a solution of one ounce of green copperas in a quart of water. -Other Black Stains. — 1. Drop a little sulphuric acid into a small quantity of water; brush over the wood and hold it to the fire ; it will be a fine black and receive a good polish. 2. For a beautiful black, on wood, nothing can exceed black japan. Apply two coats; after which, varnish and polish it. 3. To 1 gallon vinegar, add a quarter of a pound of iron rust; let it stand for a week ; then add a pound of dry lamp-black, and three-quarters of a pound copperas; stir it up for a couple of days. Lay on five or six coats with a sponge, -allowing it to dry between each ; polish with linseed oil and a soft woollen rag, and it will look like ebony. 4. Vinegar, y 2 gal. ; dry lamp-black, y 2 lb. ; iron rust sifted, 3 lbs. ; mix and let stand for a week. Lay three coats of this on hot, and then rub with linseed oil, and you will have a fine deep black. 5. Add to the above stain nut-galls, 1 oz. ; logwood chips, y 2 lb. ; copperas, J4 lb. ; lay on three coats ; oil well, and you will have a black stain that will stand any kind of weather, and is well adapted for ships\\' combings, etc. 6. Logwood chips, y 2 lb.; Brazil-wood, % lb.; boil for 1^2 hours in 1 gallon water. Brush the wood with this decoction while hot; make a decoction of nut-galls, by gentle simmering for three or four days, a quarter of a pound of the galls in 3 qts. water ; give the wood three coats, and, while wet, lay on a solution of sulphate of iron (2 ozs. to a quart), and, when dry, oil or varnish. 7. Give three coats with a solution of copper filings in aquafortis, and repeatedly brush over with the logwood decoction until the greenness of the copper is destroyed. 8. Boil y 2 lb. logwood chips in 2 quarts water ; add an ounce of pearlash, and apply hot with a brush. Then take 2 quarts of the logwood decoction, and y 2 oz. of verdigris, and the same of copperas; strain, and throw in y 2 lb. of iron rust. Brush the work well with this, and oil. -Brown Stain. — Boil 1 lb. of the brown pigment called Terre de Cassel with 4 quarts of water, until it is re-duced one-third. Mix two ounces (Troy) of white potash with sufficient water to dissolve it, and mix with the Terre de Cassel. This stain must be applied with a brush, two or even three times, according to the depth of the shade required. -Walnut Stain. — Mix together, by stirring, i quart spirits of turpentine, I pint asphaltum varnish, i pint of japan, i lb. dry burnt umber, i lb. dry Venetian red; apply with a brush. This stain is transparent, and allows the grain of the wood to show through. -Another. — Boil iyi ounces of washing-soda, and %. ounce bichromate of potash, in i quart of water; add 2y 2 ounces Vandyke brown. This stain may be used either hot or cold. -Another. — With a brush apply a thin solution of permanganate of potassa in water, until the desired color is produced, allowing each coat to dry before another is applied. -Oak Stain. — Add to a quart of water 2 ounces each of potash and pearlash. This is a very good stain, but it should be used carefully as it blisters the hands and softens brushes. The stain may be made lighter by adding more water. -Liquid ammonia laid on evenly with a rag or brush will deepen the color immediately, and it will not fade, this being an artificial production of result produced naturally by age. -Bichromate of potash, dissolved in cold water, and applied with a brush, will produce a similar result. -Rosewood Stain. — Mix in a bottle ]/\\\\ lb. of extract of logwood, i oz. salts of tartar, and i pint of water; in another bottle, put i lb. of old iron in small pieces, and i pint of vinegar, which, after standing twentyfour hours, will be ready for use; make a hard stiff brush with a piece of rattan sharpened at one end in a wedge shape, pounding it so as to separate the fibre. Mix in i pint of varnish, *4 lb. of finely-powdered rosepink. The materials are now ready, and the first thing in the process is to stain the wood with the logwood stain; give two coats of this, allowing the first to become nearly dry before applying the second; then dip the rattan brush in the vinegar, and with it form the grain, after which give the work a coat of the varnish and rose pink. There can be no definite directions given for graining, except to study the natural wood and imitate it as near as possible. With the above materials skilfully applied, any common wood can be made to resemble rosewood so nearly that it will take a good judge to distinguish the difference. -Another. — Boil i lb. of logwood in i gallon of water, add a double handful of walnut shells, boil the whole again, strain the liquor and add to it I pint of the best vinegar. It is then ready for use. Apply it boiling -hot, and when the wood is dry, form red veins in imitation of the grain of rosewood with a brush dipped in the following solution: Nitric acid, i pint; metallic tin, i oz. ; sal ammoniac, i oz. Mix and set aside to dissolve, occasionally shaking. -Cherry Stain. — Mix together, by stirring, i quart of spirits of turpentine, i pint of varnish, and i lb. of dry burnt sienna ; apply with a brush, and after it has been on about five minutes wipe it off with rags. This stain takes about 12 hours to dry. -Another Cherry Stain. — Take 1 quart alcohol, 2 ozs. of dragon\\'s-blood; pulverize the latter along with J4 oz. of alkanet root ; mix, and let stand in a warm place a couple of days. Shake frequently in the meantime. Apply with a sponge or brush. Two or three coats may be required. This makes a fine stain. -Red Stain for Common Work. — Archil will produce a very good stain of itself when used cold, but if after one or two coats have been applied and suffered to get almost dry, it is brushed over with a hot solution of pearlash in water, it will improve the color. -Mahogany Stain. — To darken mahogany, apply a weak solution of bichromate of potash in water. Apply successive coats, allowing each to dry, until the required shade is secured. -Surface Stains. — The following are for the most part used to apply to woods of inferior quality, to make them resemble choicer woods. The colors are all to be -mixed with very thin glue size, laid on warm with a soft woollen material, and the wood wiped dry after application. All the colors used in staining should be well pulverized, and before use the liquid should be strained. -Imitation Walnut Stain. — Burnt umber and yellow ochre, mixed in proportions to give desired shade. -Fine Crimson Stain. — Boil i lb. of good Brazil dust in 3 quarts of water for an hour; strain it, and add y 2 oz. of cochineal;, boil it again gently for half an hour, and it will be fit for use. -If you will have it more of a scarlet tint, boil half an ounce of saffron in a quart of water for an hour, and pass over the work previous to the red stain. -Fine Blue Stain. — Into i lb. of oil of vitriol (sulphuric acid) in a clean glass phial, put 4 ozs. of indigo, and proceed as above directed in dyeing purple. -Yellow Stain. — Dissolve y lb. tumeric in 1 pint alcohol; let it stand until the tumeric settles to the bottom. -Another. — A small piece of aloes added to the varnish will have all the effect of a bright yellow stain. -To Brighten Stains. — Ary of the stains named (except the surface stains) will be rendered much more brilliant by an application of the following : 1 oz. nitric acid, y teaspoonful muriatic acid, y oz. grain tin, 2 ozs. rain water. Mix in a bottle, at least two days before using, and keep the bottle well corked. -Dyeing wood is mostly applied for the purpose of veneers, while staining is more generally had recourse to to give the desired color to the article after it has been manufactured. In the one case, the color should penetrate throughout, while in the latter the surface is all that is essential. -In dyeing, pear-tree, holly and beech, take the best black; but for most colors, holly is preferable. It is also best to have wood as young and as newly cut as possible. After the veneers are cut, they should be allowed to lie in a trough of water for four or five days before they are put into the copper ; as the water, acting as a purgative to the wood, brings out an abundance of slimy matter, which must be removed, or the wood will never be a good color. After this purificatory process, they should be dried in the open air for at least twelve hours. They are then ready for the copper. By these simple means the color will strike much quicker, and be of a brighter hue. It would also add to the improvement of the colors, if, after the veneers have boiled a few hours, they are taken out, dried in the air, and again immersed in the coloring copper. Always dry veneers in the open air, for fire invariably injures the colors. -Fine Black Dye. — Put 6 lbs. of chip logwood into the copper, with as many veneers as it will conveniently -hold, without pressing too tight ; fill it with water, and let it boil slowly for about three hours; then add half a pound of powdered verdigris, half a pound of copperas, and 4 ounces of bruised nut-galls ; fill the copper up with vinegar as the water evaporates; let it boil gently two hours each day till the wood is dyed through. -Another. — Procure some liquor from a tanner\\'s pit, or make a strong decoction of oak bark, and to every gallon of the liquor add a quarter of a pound of green copperas, and mix them well together; put the liquor into the copper, and make it quite hot, but not boil ; immerse the veneers in it, and let them remain for an hour ; take them out, and expose them to the air till it has penetrated its substance ; then add some logwood to the solution, place the veneers again in it, and let it simmer for two or three hours; let the whole cool gradually. dry the veneers in the shade, and they will be a very fine black. -Fine Blue Dye. — Into a clean glass bottle put i lb. of oil of vitriol, and 4 ozs. of the best indigo pounded in a mortar (take care to set the bottle in a basin or earthen glazed pan, as it will ferment) ; then put the veneers into a copper or stone trough ; fill it rather more than one-third with water, and add as much of the vitriol and indigo (stirring it about) as will make a fine blue, which may be known by trying it with a piece of white paper or wood. Let the veneers remain till the dye has struck through. -The color will be much improved if the solution of indigo in vitriol be kept a few weeks before using it. The color will strike better if the veneers are boiled in plain water till completely soaked through, and then allowed for a few hours to dry partially, previous to being immersed in the dye. -Another. — Throw pieces of quicklime into soft water ; stir it well ; when settled, strain or pour off the clear part; then to every gallon add ten or twelve ounces of the best turnsole; put the whole into the copper with the veneers, which should be of white holly, and prepared as usual by boiling in water; let them simmer gently till the color has sufficiently penetrated, but be careful not to let them boil in it, as it would injure the color. -A Fine Yellozv Dye. — Reduce 4 lbs. of the root of barberry, by sawing, to dust, which put in a copper or brass trough ; add 4 ozs. of turmeric and 4 gallons of water, then put in as many white holly veneers as the liquor will cover; boil them together for three hours, often turning them ; when cool, add 2 ozs. of aquafortis and the dye will strike through much sooner. -A Bright Yellow Dye. — To every gallon of water necessary to cover the veneers, add 1 lb. of French berries; boil the veneers till the color has penetrated through ; add to the infusion of the French berries, the liquid for brightening colors given on page 43, and let the veneers remain for two or three hours, and the color will be very bright. -Bright Green Dye. — Proceed as in either of the previous receipts to produce a yellow; but instead of adding * aquafortis or the brightening liquid, add as much vitriolated indigo (see page 44) as will produce the desired color. -Green Dye. — Dissolve 4 ozs. of the best verdigris, and of sap-green and indigo half an ounce each, in 3 pints of the best vinegar ; put in the veneers, and gently boil till the color has penetrated sufficiently. -The hue of the green may be varied by altering the proportion of the ingredients ; and it is advised, unless wanted for a particular purpose, to leave out the sapgreen, as it is a vegetable color very apt to change, or turn brown, when exposed to the air. -Bright Red Dye. — To 2 lbs. of genuine Brazil dust, add 4 gallons of water ; put in as many veneers as the liquor will cover ; boil them for three hours ; then add 2 ozs. of alum, and 2 ozs. of aquafortis, and keep it lukewarm until it has struck through. -Red Dye. — To every pound of logwood chips, add 2 gallons of water; put in the veneers, and boil as in the last ; then add a sufficient quantity of the brightening liquid (see page 43) till you see the color to your mind; keep the whole as warm as the finger can be borne in it, till the color has sufficiently penetrated. -The logwood chips should be picked from all foreign substances, with which it generally abounds, as bark, dirt, etc. ; and it is always best when fresh cut, which -may be known by its appearing of a bright-red color; for if stale, it will look brown, and not yield so much coloring matter. -Purple Dye. — To 2 lbs. of chip logwood and half a pound of Brazil dust, add 4 gallons of water, and after putting in the veneers, boil them for at least three hours ; then add 6 ozs. of pearlash and 2 ozs. of alum ; let them boil for two or three hours every day, till the color has struck through. -The Brazil dust only contributes to make the purple of a more red cast ; you may, therefore, omit it, if you require a deep bluish purple. -Another. — Boil 2 lbs. of logwood, either in chips or powder, in 4 gallons of water, with the veneers ; after boiling till the color is well struck in, add by degrees vitriolated indigo (see page 44) till the purple is of the shade required, which may be known by trying it with a piece of paper ; let it then boil for one hour, and keep the liquid in a milk-warm state till the color has penetrated the veneer. This method, when properly managed, will produce a brilliant purple, not so likely to fade as the foregoing. -Liquid for Brightening and Setting Colors. — To every pint of strong aquafortis, add 1 oz. of grain tin, and a piece of sal ammoniac of the size of a walnut; set it by to dissolve, shake the bottle round with the cork out, from time to time; in the course of two or three days it will be fit for use. This will be found an -admirable liquid to add to any color, as it not only brightens it, but renders it less likely to fade from exposure to the air. -Orange Dye. — Let the veneers be dyed by either of the methods given in page 45, of a fine deep yellow, and while they are still wet and saturated with the dye, transfer them to the bright red dye as in page 45, till the color penetrates equally throughout. -Silver Gray Dye. — Expose to the weather in a castiron pot of six or eight gallons, old iron nails, hoops, etc., till covered with rust ; add 1 gallon of vinegar and 2 of water, boil all well for an hour; have the veneers ready, which must be hard-wood (not too dry), put them in the copper used to dye black, and pour the iron liquor over them; add 1 lb. of chip logwood and 2 ozs. of bruised nut-galls ; then boil up another pot of the iron liquor to supply the copper with, keeping the veneers covered, and boiling two hours a day, till the required color is obtained. -Gray Dye. — Expose any quantity of old iron, or what is better, the borings of gun-barrels, etc., in any convenient vessel, and from time to time sprinkle them with spirits of salt (muriatic acid) diluted in four times its quantity of water, till they are very thickly covered with rust; then to every six pounds add a gallon of water, in which has been dissolved two ounces of salt of tartar ; lay the veneers in the copper, and cover them with this liquid; let it boil for two or three hours till -well soaked, then to every gallon of liquor add a quarter of a pound of green copperas, and keep the whole at a moderate temperature till the dye has sufficiently penetrated. -Gilding, Silvering and Bronzing are processes of applying to previously prepared surfaces a thin layer of gold or silver leaf, or in bronzing, of a fine powder, prepared from various metals and intended to imitate the peculiar appearance of genuine bronze. The processes of gilding and silvering being identical, the description of one will suffice to explain the other. -Gilding. — Gold leaf, applied to articles of furniture as a means of decoration, is used in two ways; it is applied over an ordinary varnish or other finish, in which case but little special preparation is necessary; or, as when used for picture frames, cornices, etc., it is applied to a specially prepared foundation, the basis of which is whiting, mixed with various other ingredients suggested by experience or fancy. In either case, the gold leaf is caused to adhere to the work, by size specially prepared for the purpose, receipts for which follow herewith; the size being first applied to the work, and when it has become of the right consistency, the gold is laid upon it. Oil-Gilding and Burnish-Gilding are different methods used to obtain certain desired effects, the former principally for articles exposed to the weather, and for heightening the effect of incised carving or engraving, and the latter for picture-frames and articles having a specially prepared foundation, whose entire surface is. to be gilded. It is intended that the -gold shall adhere to the work only in the places to which the size has been applied, but the smallest portion of oil or even a slight dampness may cause the gold to partially adhere to the adjoining surface, resulting in slightly ragged edges; to prevent this, before applying the size to the desired design, the entire surface is covered with a thin film of some substance perfectly free from moisture, and easily removable by water, after completion of the process. Directions regarding this preliminary process are given under the caption: To Prevent Gold Adhering. -The Requisites. — First, a sufficient quantity of leafgold, which is of two sorts — the deep gold, as it is called, and the pale gold. The former is the best; the latter very useful, and may occasionally be introduced for variety or effect. -Second, a gilder\\'s cushion : an oblong piece of wood, covered with rough calf-skin, stuffed with flannel several times doubled, with a border of parchment, about four inches deep, at one end, to prevent the air blowing the leaves about when placed on the cushion. -Fourthly, several camel-hair pencils in sizes, and tips, made of a few long camel\\'s hairs put between two cards, in the same manner as hairs are put into tin cases for brushes, thus making a flat brush with a very few hairs. -Sizes. — These are of two kinds: oil sizes are those which when applied, present an adhesive surface, requiring the immediate laying of the gold-leaf upon it ; of this class is the oil-size commonly used in decorating furniture; water-sizes are those that are allowed to become dry and hard when applied, and are rendered adhesive when the gold is to be laid, by brushing over with water; for burnish-gilding these are always employed, as oil-size does not dry sufficiently hard to permit of burnishing. -Oil-Size for Oil-Gilding. — Grind calcined red-ochre with the best and oldest drying-oil. When desired for use, add sufficient oil of turpentine to make it work freely. -Parchment-Size. — For preparing Frames, etc. — To half a pound of parchment shavings, or cuttings of white leather, add three quarts of water, and boil it in a proper vessel till reduced to nearly-half the quantity; then take it off the fire, and strain it through a sieve. Be careful in the boiling to keep it well stirred, and do not let burn. -Gold-Size for Burnish-Gilding. — Grind fine salammoniac well with a muller and stone ; scrape into it a little beef suet, and grind all well together; after which, mix in with a pallet-knife a small proportion of parchment-size with a double proportion of water. -Another. — Grind a lump of tobacco-pipe clay into a very stiff paste with thin size ; add a small quantity of ruddle and fine black lead, ground very fine, and temper the whole with a small piece of tallow. When ready to use, reduce with parchment-size until it will just flow from the brush. -Another. — Grind separately in water, i lb. Armenian bole, 2 ozs. red lead, a sufficient quantity of black lead ; mix, and regrind with a small quantity of olive oil. Reduce with parchment-size to the proper consistency. -To Prevent Gold Adhering. — Either one of the following methods will prevent gold-leaf or bronze from adhering to the surface beyond the outlines of the sizing laid on to receive it : -2. Whiting mixed in water, and applied with a soft brush. When the water has evaporated, dust off the superfluous whiting with an ordinary paint duster. By this method a very thin coating of whiting remains, which is free from any grittiness. One advantage gained by the use of whiting thus applied is, it furnishes a whitish ground over which clear varnish or oil-size may be distinctly seen as the striping progresses. After the leaf or bronze has been applied, the work must be carefully washed, so as to insure the removal of the whiting. -4. A thin wash of starch water, either brushed on with a flat camel-hair brush, or applied with a soft sponge. -5. Take ball liquorice and water, a weak solution, and apply with a soft brush. This may be kept in a bottle ready for use at any time. -6. Cut a new potato in two, and rub over the part to be sized with the raw face exposed, allowing the juice to remain until dry. -It will be observed that any substance which interposes a film over the varnish, itself being free from tackiness and readily removed by water, will answer the purpose. -Oil Gilding. — Applying the Gold. — If the wood to be gilded is finished with varnish or otherwise, no additional foundation is necessary upon which to lay the gold-leaf; if the wood is not finished, after it has been smoothed and dusted, give it one or two coats of parchment size, after it is perfectly dry and hard, again smoothing the surface with fine sand-paper. That the gold may not adhere to any part of the work except where the size is hard, powder the surface lightly with whiting from a pounce-bag, which is a small bag made of material sufficiently loose to permit the powdered whiting to sift through as fine dust; if preferred, any of the preceding receipts for that purpose can be used -instead. Remove the surplus whiting with the dustingbrush, and the work is then ready for the size. Apply this with a sable or fit brush of the proper size, carefully observing to make the outer lines of the design clear and sharp, that the work may not appear ragged. Let the size remain until it feels tacky, when the gold may be applied. This is the most difficult part of the operation, and experience is necessary before gold-leaf can be laid smoothly without a wrinkle or a break. Turn a leaf of gold out of the book upon the cushion; breathe gently upon the center of the leaf and it will lay flat on the cushion; cut it to the proper size by bringing the knife perpendicularly over it, and sawing it gently until divided. Take your tip (a brush used for the purpose) and after drawing it lightly over your hair to remove any particles of dust that may be upon it, breathe upon it gently, which will dampen it sufficiently to cause the leaf of gold to adhere to it ; lay the tip upon the leaf of gold and carefully transfer it to the work; blow upon it gently and it will straighten out and adhere. It may be rendered quite smooth by slightly dabbing it with a bit of cotton. In about an hour wash off the superfluous gold from the edges, with a sponge and water. If the article is to be exposed to the weather or much wear, the gilding may be varnished with copal varnish. -Burnish-Gilding. — As previously stated, this process requires a specially prepared foundation upon which to -lay the gold, and as the preparation of this foundation is a distinct trade, the furniture dealer or cabinet-maker seldom finds it necessary to undertake it, the articles coming to his hand ready-prepared for gilding; but as in repairing picture-frames, cornices, mirror frames, etc., it frequently becomes necessary to renew the foundation, a comprehensive description of the whole process is given. -Preparing the Wood-work. — After smoothing and dusting the work, coat the frames in every part with boiling-hot parchment-size, as previously described, then mix a sufficient quantity of whiting with size to the consistency of thick cream, and with it by means of a brush, coat every part of the frame several times, permitting each coat to become perfectly dry before proceeding with the next. The wood will thus be covered with a layer of hard whiting nearly or quite a sixteenth of an inch in thickness. The size must not be too thick, and when mixed with the whiting should not be so hot as the preliminary coat of size. -Polishing. — When the prepared frames are quite dry, clean and polish them. To do this, wet a small piece at a time, and, with a smooth, fine piece of cloth, dipped in water, rub the part till all the bumps and inequalities are removed ; and for those parts where the fingers will not enter, as the mouldings, etc., wind the wet cloth round a piece of wood, and by this means make the surface all smooth and even alike. -Where there is carved work, etc., it will sometimes be necessary to bring the mouldings to their original sharpness by means of chisels, gouges, etc., as the preparation will be apt to fill up all the finer parts of the work, which must be thus restored. It is sometimes the practice, after polishing, to go over the work once with fine yellow or Roman ochre; but this is rarely necessary. -Applying the Size. — Select the proper gold size from the receipts previously given ; add parchment size until it will just flow from the brush ; make it quite hot, and apply it to the work with a very soft brush, taking care not to make the first coat too thick ; let it dry and give two or three successive coats, after the last brushing it with a stiff brush to remove any inequalities. The work is then ready for the gold. -Laying the Gold. — The manipulation of the gold-leaf has been described under the heading Oil-Gilding. In the process now being described, the size used (being water-size, which as previously explained is permitted to become hard and dry after being applied) must be moistened to cause the gold-leaf to adhere to it. For this purpose, with a long-haired camel-hair pencil, dipped in water, go over as much of the work as you intend the piece of gold to cover; then lay the gold upon it in the manner previously explained. Be sure that the part to which the gold is applied is sufficiently wet; indeed it must be floating, or the gold will be apt -to crack. Proceed in this manner a little at a time, and do not attempt to cover too much at once, until by experience you are able to handle the gold with freedom. In proceeding with the work, if any flows or cracks appear, immediately apply a portion of gold sufficient to cover them. Sometimes when the gold does not appear to adhere sufficiently tight, it will be necessary to draw a pencil quite filled with water close to the edge of the gold, that the water may run underneath it and soften the size. -Burnishing. — When the work is covered with gold, set it by to dry; there is a particular state or degree of dryness, known only by experience in which the moulding is in a fit state for burnishing ; it will probably be ready to burnish in about eight of ten hours, but it will depend on the warmth of the room or state of the air. -When it is ready, those parts intended to be burnished must be dusted with a soft brush; then wiping the burnisher with a piece of soft wash-leather (quite dry) begin to burnish about an inch or two in length at a time, taking care not to bear too hard, but with a gentle and quick motion, applying the tool until all the parts of the surface are equally bright. -Matting or Dead Gold. — Certain portions only of the work are burnished, according to the fancy, and the facility with which the burnishing-tool can be applied; the remaining parts are now to be deprived of -their metallic lustre, to make a more effective contrast with the burnishing. The parts thus treated are said to be matted or dead-gold. The process is as follows *. -Grind some vermilion or yellow ochre very fine, and mix a very small portion either with the parchment size or with the white of an egg, and with a very soft brush lay it evenly on the parts to be dulled; if well done, it will add greatly to the beauty of the work. Previous to matting, the work must be well cleared of superfluous gold, by means of a soft brush. -Finishing. — In elaborate works it is frequently impossible to lay gold-leaf into all the intricacies of an elaborate design, and the parts thus left bare must be finished by touching up with a small brush charged with shell-gold, or gold-powder, mixed with gum-Arabic to the proper consistency. The following receipt describes the preparation of shell-gold : -Shell Gold. — Take any quantity of leaf-gold and grind it with a small portion of honey, to a fine powder, add a little gum-Arabic and sugar-candy, with a little water, and mix it well together ; let it dry. -Silver She. — Grind pipe-clay fine with a little blacklead and good soap, and add parchment-size as directed for gold-size. -Composition for Frame Ornaments. — The ornaments for gilded mirror-frames, etc., are usually moulded from some plastic substance that is somewhat tougher and more durable than the ordinary gilding founda-tion of whiting and size. The proper moulds being prepared they are thoroughly rubbed upon the inside with sweet oil, and the composition firmly pressed in; after removing the mould the cast may be dried by a gentle heat, or while still plastic it can be applied in its proper place and bent into any position. Following are receipts for composition : -Dissolve i lb. of glue in i gallon of water. In another kettle boil together 2 lbs. of resin, 1 gill of Venice turpentine, and 1 pint of linseed oil ; mix altogether in one kettle, and boil and stir till the water has evaporated. Turn the whole into a tub of finely-rolled whiting, and work it till it is of the consistency of dough. -Boil 7 lbs. of best glue in 7 half-pints of water. Melt 3 lbs. of white resin in 3 pints of raw linseed oil. When the above has been well boiled put them into a large vessel and simmer them for half an hour, stirring the mixture and taking care that it does not boil over. The whole must then be turned into a box of whiting rolled and sifted, and mixed till it is of the consistency of dough. -To Manipulate Gold Leaf. — Get a piece of paper, thin enough to show shadow of gold-leaf through, slightly wax.it, lay it on .gold-leaf, the latter will then adhere, and can be easily worked, and will come off clean. The paper should be slightly larger than the gold-leaf, and the fingers passed over the paper to make the gold-leaf adhere. -Bronzing. — This is a process for imitating on metal, plaster, wood, or other material, the peculiar appearance produced by chemical action upon the surface of bronze metal. It is accomplished by spreading over the surface of the material to be ornamented a very thin coating of bronze-powder, which is caused to adhere either by applying it directly upon a coating of any of the sizes mentioned in the foregoing pages, or by mixing with a vehicle, such as gum-Arabic or transparent varnish. The latter is most desirable, as in the other case, being subject to the direct action of the atmosphere, the bronzepowder soon tarnishes. In ornamenting furniture, bronzing is generally employed to represent gilding, a variety of bronze called gold-bronze being used, which affords an excellent imitation but is not very lasting. It is usually applied after the completion of the other finishing processes, the ground work being prepared in the manner described under Oil-Gilding, and the size likewise applied as there described. A small wad of cotton-batting is then dipped in the bronze and passed gently over the sized portions, causing the bronze to adhere. In the other method — that of applying the bronze by means of a vehicle — the preliminaries of whiting the ground and sizing are not necessary, a small quantity of bronze being simply mixed with the vehicle employed to such a degree of fluidity that it will flow easily, and in that condition applied with a fine brush. Many preparations are -used as vehicles, such as transparent varnish thinned with turpentine, gum-Arabic dissolved in water, and gold-size reduced with parchment-size. There are a variety of colors in bronze-powders, and to produce the best effect the size or vehicle should be of a color similar to that of the bronze used; in gold-size the coloring pigment is ochre, and in its place, for greenbronze, red-bronze, or blue-bronze, may be employed respectively verditer, vermilion or Prussian blue, a very small quantity being sufficient. In bronzing on painted work the ground should be as nearly as possible the color of the bronze to be applied. -Glue. — Glue is prepared from waste pieces of skin, horns, hoofs, and other animal offal. These are steeped, washed, boiled, strained, melted, reboiled and cast into square cakes, which are then dried. The strongest kind of glue is made from the hides of oxen ; that from the bones and sinews is weaker. The older the animal the stronger the glue. Good glue should be hard in the cake, of a strong, dark color, almost transparent, free from black or cloudy spots, and with little or no smell. The best sorts are transparent and of a clear amber color. Inferior kinds are sometimes contaminated with the lime used for removing the hair from the skins of which they are made. The best glue swells considerably (the more the better) when immersed in cold water, but does not dissolve, and returns to its former size when dry. Inferior glue made from bones, will, however, dissolve almost entirely in cold water. -To Prepare Glue. — To prepare glue for use it should be broken up into small pieces, and soaked in as much cold water as will cover it, for about twelve hours. It should then be melted in a double glue pot, covered to keep the glue from dirt. Care must be taken to keep the outer vessel full of water, so that the glue shall not burn, or be brought to a temperature higher than that of boiling water. The glue is allowed to simmer for -two or three hours, then gradually melted, so much hot water being added as will make it liquid enough, just to run off a brush in a continuous stream, without breaking into drops. When the glue is done with, some boiling water should be added to make it very thin before it is put away. Freshly-made glue is stronger than that which has been repeatedly melted. Too large a quantity should not therefore be made at a time. Glue may be freed from the foreign animal matter generally in it by softening it in cold water, washing it with the same several times, till it no longer gives out any color, then bruising it with the hand, and suspending it in a linen bag beneath the surface of a large quantity of water at 66° Fahr. By doing this the pure glue is retained in the bag, and the soluble impurities pass through. If the softened glue be heated to 122 without water, and filtered, some other impurities will be retained by the filter, and a colorless solution of glue be obtained. -The addition of a little bichromate of potash will render glue impervious to moisture after exposing to the light, and a small quantity of methylated spirits will greatly improve its keeping qualities. -Mixing Glue. — A minimum amount of glue should be used in good work, and it should be applied as hot as possible. The surfaces of the wood to be united should be clean, dry, and true ; they should be brought together as tightly as possible, so that the superfluous -glue is squeezed out. The cohesion of a piece of solid glue, or the force required to separate one square inch, is four thousand pounds. The strength of common glue for coarse work is increased by the addition of a little powdered chalk. The hotter the glue the greater its cohesion; therefore in all large and long joints the glue should be applied immediately after boiling. Glue loses much of its strength by frequent re-melting ; that glue, therefore, which is newly made, is much preferable to that which has been re-boiled. -Glue Pot. — A glue pot recently perfected consists of a circular kerosene lamp, made of tin, resting upon a tin bottom 8y 2 inches in diameter. The lamp is fitted with a tin chimney in place of glass, and fitted with a small aperture, covered with mica, so as to see how to regulate the flame. The glue pot is made of copper, tinned on the inside and supported upon a rim setting up about six inches from the bottom of the lamp, the rim supported by three legs, soldered and riveted to the rim and bottom of lamp rest. The pot in which the bottom is placed has a portion of the bottom arched, to give more heating surface, and connecting with the chamber under the pot is a flue, passing out and up alongside of the pot, which carries off any smoke from the lamp, and also acts as a draft to the flame. This pot is five inches in diameter, and about six inches high. The pot for the reception of the glue is set in the same as an ordinary glue pot, and will hold about a -quart of glue. The whole can be carried to any place where you wish to use it, and still have the heat kept up. The cost of oil is but a few cents a week. -Another improvement is in the pot being of copper, tinned. It will not corrode and spoil the glue, as is the case with iron. -French cabinet-makers use a glue pot with an inside pan made of glazed earthenware and divided radially into three divisions, in one of which is kept strong glue, in another weaker, and in the third water only, with a brush or piece of sponge for cleaning off superfluous glue from the work. -A few holes bored near the top of the inner vessel of a glue pot by admitting steam from the outer vessel will prevent the glue from solidifying on the side. They need not be bored round the whole circumference of the pot, to allow of pouring out the glue if necessary. -To Prevent Glue Cracking. — Glue frequently cracks because of the dryness of the air in rooms warmed by .stoves. The addition of chloride of calcium to glue will prevent this disagreeable property of cracking. Chloride of calcium is such a deliquescent salt that it attracts enough moisture to prevent the glue from cracking. Glue thus prepared will adhere to glass, metal, etc., and can be used for putting on labels without danger of their dropping off. -Strong Glue to Resist Moisture. — Dissolve gumsandarac and mastic, of each a quarter of an ounce, in -a quarter of a pint of spirits of wine, to which add a\" quarter of an ounce of clear turpentine; now take strong glue, or that in which isinglass has been dissolved; then, putting the gums into a double glue-pot, add by degrees the glue, constantly stirring it over the fire till the whole is well incorporated ; strain it through a cloth, and it is ready for use. You may now return it to the glue pot, and add half an ounce of very finelypowdered glass ; use it quite hot. If you join two pieces, of wood together with it, you may, when perfectly hard and dry, immerse it in water, and the joint will not separate. -Glue to Resist Moisture. — To two quarts of skimmed milk add half a pound of the best glue ; melt them together, taking care they do not boil over, and you will have a very strong glue, which will resist damp or moisture. -Portable Glue. — Boil one pound of the best glue, strain it very clear; boil also four ounces of isinglass; put it into a double glue-pot, with half a pound of fine brown sugar, and boil it pretty thick ; then pour it into plates or moulds. When cold you may cut and dry them for the pocket. -This glue is very useful to draughtsmen, architects* etc., as it immediately dilutes in warm water, and fastens the paper without the process of dampening; or, it may be used by softening it in the mouth/ and applying it to the paper. -How to get fresh air in the glue room during the hot periods of summer, and at the same time not have the disturbing drafts that evaporate thinly-spread glue, is quite a problem. Yet, like many other problems, it is largely a matter of attention to details. . There are various ways of ventilating rooms so as to get fresh air without getting a strong current. The temptation is naturally strong to throw open windows and doors in hot weather, so as to have a breeze, but generally this is the very thing one must guard against. -Some glue rooms that have windows on one side and the other three sides carefully inclosed, may have the windows opened without producing a strong draft, but, even so, it is better to have window screens made of fine, close-meshed wire, something like those used on railway trains to keep out the dust. They will help keep out the dust, keep out the draft, and also keep out insects that are tempted by the odor of the glue to make a visit to the glue room. There are other variations, such as letting down the top windows instead of raising the bottom ones; others in which a box-like arrangement opening upward instead of straight in, is inserted under the window to let in the fresh air and turn it upward instead of across the room. These are mechanical ventilators that can be used for scientifically ventilating a room without producing currents. And -there are, in fact, many ways to get around this draft business, and while their use may deprive the glue room of some of the breeziness that is inviting in summer, still they will furnish fresh air in a manner that is more healthful to those working in it, as well as less damaging to the glue work than strong currents. -To Raise Old Veneers. — First, wash the surface with boiling water, and, with a coarse cloth, remove dirt or grease; then place it before the fire, or heat it with a caul; oil its surface with common linseed-oil, place it again to the fire, and the heat will make the oil penetrate quite through the veneer, and soften the glue underneath ; then, while hot, raise the edge gently with a chisel, and it will separate completely from the ground ; be careful not to use too great force, or the work will be spoiled. Again, if it should get cold during the operation, apply more oil, and heat it again. Repeat this process till the veneer is entirely separated, then wash off the old glue and proceed to lay it again as a new veneer. -To Take Out Bruises in Furniture. — Wet the part with warm water; double a piece of brown paper five or six times, soak it, and lay it on the place ; apply on that a hot flat-iron till the moisture is evaporated. If the bruise be not gone, repeat the process. After two or three applications, the dent or bruise will be raised level with the surface. If the bruise be small, merely soak it with warm water, and apply a red-hot poker very near the surface; keep it continually wet, and in a few minutes the bruise will disappear. -To Make Paste for Laying Cloth or Leather. — To a pint of the best wheaten flour add resin, very finely -powdered, about two large spoonfuls; of alum, one spoonful, in powder; mix them all well together, put them into a pan, and add by degrees soft or rain water, carefully stirring it till it is of the consistence of thinnish cream; put it into a saucepan over a clear fire, keeping it constantly stirred, that it may not get lumpy. When it is of a stiff consistence, so that the spoon will stand upright in it, it is done enough. Be careful to stir it well from the bottom, for it will burn if not well attended to. Empty it out into a pan and cover it over till cold, to prevent a skin forming on the top, which would make it lumpy. -This paste is very superior for the purpose, and adhesive. To use it for cloth or baize, spread the paste evenly and smoothly on the top of the table, and lay the cloth on it, pressing and smoothing it with a flat piece of wood; let it remain till dry; then trim the edges close to the cross-banding. If you cut it close at first, it will, in drying, shrink and look bad where it meets the banding all round. If used for leather, the leather must be first previously damped, and then the paste spread over it; then lay it on the table, and rub it smooth and level with a linen cloth, and cut the edges close to the banding with a short knife. Some lay their table cover with glue instead of paste, and for cloth perhaps it is the best method; but for leather it is not proper, as glue is apt to run through. In using it for cloth, great care must be taken that the glue be -not too thin, and that the cloth be well rubbed down with a thick piece of wood made hot at the fire, for the glue soon chills. By this method, the edges may be cut off close to the border at once. -Cements for Stopping Flaws in Wood. — Put any quantity of fine sawdust of the same wood your work is made with into an earthen pan, and pour boiling water on it, stir it well, and let it remain for a week or ten days, occasionally stirring it; then boil it for some time, and it will be of the consistence of pulp or paste ; put it into a coarse cloth, and squeeze all the moisture from it. Keep for use, and, when wanted, mix a sufficient quantity of thin glue to make it into a paste ; rub it well into the cracks, or fill up the holes in your work with it. When quite hard and dry, clean your work off, and if carefully done, you will scarcely discern the imperfection. -Mahogany-Colored Cement. — Melt two ounces of beeswax and half an ounce of Indian red,, and a small quantity of yellow ochre, to bring the. cement to the desired color ; keep it in a pipkin for use. , -Cement for Turners. — Melt together beeswax, one ounce ; resin, half an ounce ; and pitch, half an ounce ; stir in the mixture some very fine brickdust to give it a body. If too soft, add more resin; if too hard, more wax. When nearly cold, make it up into cakes or rolls, which keep for use. -piece of wood on the chuck, which is done by applying the roller of cement to the chuck and it will adhere with sufficient force. -To Cut Good Steel Scrapers. — Part of the blade of a broken saw makes the best scrapers ; but, as it is hard, it is very difficult to cut it into the required form. The best and most expeditious way is to mark it out to the size wanted, and then to place the blade or steel plate in a vice whose chaps shut very close, placing the mark even with the face of the vise, and the part to be cut to waste above the vise. Then with a cold-chisel, or a common steel-firmer that has its basil broken off, holding it close to the vise and rather inclined upwards, begin at one end of the steel plate, and with a sharp blow of the hammer it will cut it. Keep going on by degrees, and you will with ease cut it to the shape required ; then grind the edges of your scraper level, and finish by rubbing it on your oil stone. -To Clean Oil Paintings. — Wash with a sponge or a soft leather and water, and dry by rubbing with a silk handkerchief. When the picture is very dirty, take it out of its frame, procure a clean towel, and making it quite wet, lay it on the face of the picture, sprinkling it from time to time with clear soft water ; let it remain wet for two or three days ; take the cloth off and renew it with a fresh one; after wiping the picture with a clean wet sponge, repeat the process till all the dirt is soaked out ; then wash it well with a soft sponge, and let -it get dry; rub it with some clear nut or linseed oil. Spirits of wine and turpentine may be used to dissolve the hard old varnish, but they will attack the paint as well as the varnish if the further action of the spirits is not stopped at the proper time by using water freely. -Cleaning Varnished Pictures. — There are conditions where the above simple process will not accomplish what is required ; where a thick coating of varnish has been applied to the picture, and it has been hung in a smoky room, and dust and dirt has been allowed to gather and remain; then it is that no high lights will be visible, the sky will be dirty, no distance visible, and perhaps the figures in the foreground very indistinct. Under these conditions the varnish must be either removed or the smoke and dirt must be brought out of the varnish. If it is thought desirable to try the latter, the following receipt will be found valuable for the purpose: 2 oz. wood naptha, 1 oz. spirits of salts, % pint of linseed-oil. -Mix the above well together, and before using shake the bottle. It can be used as follows : Get some soft linen rag, and make up a soft pad, which place on the mouth of the bottle and shake up some of the mixture into the pad, then commence rubbing the picture with a circular motion, and when nearly dry again give the pad another dressing of mixture, and continue this mode of procedure for some time, when the picture will gradually come out in all its detail. -Cleaning Engravings. — Put the engraving on a smooth board, cover it thinly with common salt finely powdered. Squeeze lemon juice upon the salt so as to dissolve a considerable portion of it; elevate one end of the board so that it may form an angle of about \\'45 or 50 degrees. Pour on the engraving boiling water from a tea kettle until the salt and lemon juice be all washed off. The engraving then will be perfectly clean and free from stains. It must be dried on the board or some smooth surface gradually. If dried by the fire or the sun it will be tinged with a yellow color. -Cleaning Engravings. — Presuming these to be mounted, proceed in the following manner: Cut a stale loaf in half, with a perfectly clean knife ; pare the crust away from the edges. Now place the engravings on a perfectly flat table, and rubbing the surface with the fresh-cut bread, in circular sweeps, lightly but firmly performed, will remove 1 all superficial markings: Now soak the prints for a short time in a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid,\" say 1 part acid to rocrof water, and then remove them into -a vessel containing a sufficient quantity of clear chloride lime -water to cover them. Leave them there until bleached to the desired point: Now remove, rinse well by allowing to stand an hour in a pan in which a constant stream of water is allowed to flow, and finally dry off by spreading on clean cloths. Perhaps -the sheetsmay -require ironing between two sheets of clean paper; -To Smooth a Damaged Picture. — Paintings sometimes get convex and concave patches on their surface, owing to pressure on one side or the other, and these inequalities cause a great deal of trouble to bring out. The most successful way is to well wet both sides of the picture on the spot, and keep it under pressure till dry. With small pictures the quickest way would be to take them off the stretcher and lay them in a press, with a light pressure between soft sheets of paper. -Embossed Gilding for Illuminating. — Gilding of figures and letters on paper and for the embellishment of manuscripts, is performed with shell gold tempered with gum water; or the characters may be drawn with a milky solutionof gum ammanacum made in water, and ^old leaf applied upon them when almost dry ; they may again be sufficiently moistened for receiving the gold by breathing on them. Letters raised from the surface, if paper or parchment in the manner of embossed work, such as are seen on ancient manuscripts, may be formed either by friction on a proper body with a solid piece of gold, or by leaf gold. -The former method is practiced by tempering pulverizers\\' crystal with strong gum water, and with this paste forming the letters ; when they are dry, they are rubbed with a piece of solid gold as in polishing, and the letters will appear as if gilt with burnished gold. The letters are formed with an embossed figure, either of the separate letters or of whole words cut in steel, -and each letter of these stamps when they are used, is oiled evenly with a feather. Then fill these concave letters with the above paste, and strike the stamps in a perpendicular direction on the paper or vellum laid on sheets of soft paper. -When the embossed letters are formed with leaf gold, the following or a similar composition must be used. Thicken beaten whites of eggs with as much vermilion as is necessary to give them the consistence of paste ; use the stamps as before, and when the letters are dry moisten them by a small pencil with strong gum water, and when this is almost dry cover the letters with leaf gold, pressing it close to every part of them with cotton wood ; when dry, burnish. -Skip to main content Search UPLOAD SIGN UP | LOG IN BOOKS VIDEO AUDIO SOFTWARE IMAGESABOUT BLOG PROJECTS HELP DONATE  CONTACT JOBS VOLUNTEER PEOPLE Search Metadata Search text contents Search TV news captions Search radio transcripts Search archived websitesAdvanced SearchSign up for freeLog inFull text of \"The practical cabinet maker and furniture designer\\'s assistant, with essays on history of furniture, taste in design, color and materials, with full explanation of the canons of good taste in furniture ..\"See other formats^ -HISTORY OF FURNITURE, TASTE IN DESIGN, COLOR AND MATERIALS, WITH FULL EXPLANATION OF THE CANONS OF GOOD TASTE IN FURNITURE -Together with Many Practical Directions for Making Cabinet Work Generally, and a Number of Pieces of Furniture in Particular, along with Hundreds of Recipes for Finishing, Staining, Varnishing, Polishing and Gilding all kinds of Cabinet Work :: :: :: -Author of \"Practical Treatise on the Steel Sojmrk,\" \"Modern Carpentry,*\\' \"Hardwood Finisher, Wood-Carving,\" Etc., Etc. -In preparing this work, I think it unnecessary to waste time and space in publishing a preface, which would at least occupy from three to five pages, and which at best, would be of little service to my readers ; so I will content myself, and perhaps serve my readers better by inserting in these remarks the gist of what would be expected to appear in a preface, along with other material that may be both interesting and useful. -In these days, specialization in \"Furniture-making\" has in a great measure robbed the trade of many of its charms, as well as its claims to the dignified position it once held. -In the \"good old times\" every man who could hold up his head and say truthfully \"I am a CabinetMaker,\" meant that he had given long years of apprenticeship to every branch and every detail of the business. His assertion, when interpreted, meant \"that he could take timber, saw it, plane it, mould it, glue it, veneer it, join it, carve it, finish it, and upholster it, all by hand.\" It meant a full knowledge of everything connected with the manufacture from the entrance to the yard and to that of the wareroom. What might be expected of such workmen, in the way of completeness -and thoroughness, could be had for the hiring. Their experience was indelibly stamped upon their work. -Invention has disarranged this most certainly. The labor-saving machinery of later years has dispensed with something of the old-time necessity. Circular saws, jig and band saws, stickers, planers, jointers, carvers, and the many contrivances, for economizing time, have made those long terms of apprenticeship in a measure, unnecessary, and to-day men are not Cabinet-Makers in the sense we have referred to, but they are competent to do either circular-sawing, band-sawing, moulding, or planing, etc., alone, and but little else. This subdivision of labor has been the outgrowth of the advance of invention. -Often you will have among your applicants for work, men who belong to both classes — representatives of the \"old school\" as it were, and fledgelings who, having rubbed furniture three months in some manufactory, and consider themselves fit subjects for a diploma. It will be found to be advantageous to mix these two elements. Each has claims which are worthy of consideration. The former class, from having been drilled so faithfully in every department of the work; although, workmen of this class are apt to be wedded a little too firmly to the methods in use when they were apprentices. Workmen of the latter kind are progressive, and restless under restraint; perhaps a little too much so sometimes. But the two average well, and the -The bench hands, bear in mind, must be men of experience, with this quality more or less extended as the quality of the work may require. In cases where most of the work is machine work, the manufacturer will readily perceive that he can, with advantage to himself, engage the services of a class of men whose knowledge is confined exclusively to the machine they pledge themselves to run. Migratory workmen are a curse to themselves and the manufacturer. They are the best examples of the saying: \"A rolling stone gathers no moss.\" -The close subdivision of work in our best manufactories is conducive to uniform and generally good results, that is, that the tools and machines produced are of equable quality and uniform in build. -The system that includes the individual workman only as the intelligent part of the machinery is admirable as making him an exact reproducing agent, and consequently aiding in uniform results ; but it is to be questioned whether it is the best plan to make intelligent practical machines. It may be that possible excellence by it will be sacrificed to tolerable uniformity. Good mechanics of fifty-five years ago have little sympathy with a system that lowers the status of mechanical conditions to the level of the machine attendant, or the monotonous worker at a single branch. This system is -not consonant with the freedom of individual endeavour that seems to be a part of the American mechanics\\' aspirations. -After all the old-time job shop was about as reasonable a school as the embryo mechanic could desire. The foreman of one of the best known establishments in this country recently died. In conversation long ago he stated that his intimate knowledge of the different departments of the work was got from his experience in a \"job shop,\" where he had a chance at everything, from the lathe to the carving room. He made his own drawings (sketches), and frequently made his own designs. These accomplishments may have been crude, but they gave him the idea of how a job should be done, as well as what was to be accomplished. He was an example of one sort of a practical mechanic, of which there should be more. -Since the grand art movement, of which Victor Hugo\\'s \"Notre-Dame de Paris\" was the most brilliant expression, the taste for art objects has gradually developed with an intensity almost incredible. The stuffs, the china-ware, and above all the furniture of preceding centuries, are, now that they are old and battered, always sold for prices far higher, because of their excellence of construction and design. In this tendency it would be wrong to see nothing but a single fashion, a mania and an exaggeration, based upon fantasy and imitation; all the men of taste of one nation, -or, we might well say, of all great nations in the world, could not possibly be deceived to this extent, and with this unanimity of their fantasy, had it not a solid and serious basis. And this fashion for antique furniture does not rest upon a very reasonable and very logical foundation, — at first in its disdain for phantom furniture, which, through the perfecting of wood-working machines, has arrived at the last degrees of veneer, scarcely presenting the slightest degree of solidity, the mahogany, oak, walnut, and rose-wood with which they are coated cracking at the slightest shock, and peeling off at the least change in the dampness or dryness of the weather. All the world, too, knows equally well that the homely furniture of thirty years ago, Queen Anne and Eastlake, is equally inelegant in appearance, and uncomfortable in use. There is, then, in the desire of purchasing antique furniture, the just idea of procuring articles altogether solidly built, the form of which is always, if not absolutely conformable to the rules of art, at least entirely different from the veneer articles which, from their nature, can only be subject to very limited number of combinations, and can never furnish to the taste of architects and designers the same resources as solid wood. A longing to escape from the cold and monotonous furniture of the preceding generation added to the renaissance movement of the year of 1800, caused a greedy demand for antique furniture to suddenly arise ; but when all of those arti-cles which had remained sound and solid were sold off, it was necessary to repair, restore, and strengthen those articles which were only discovered in fragments. -While the introduction of machinery had had much to do with changing the character and working methods of the cabinet maker, it has proved a great boon to humanity generally, and has given to the masses, a class of furniture they never could have enjoyed but for the cheaper productions by the aid of power, and machines, and in these remarks, I do not wish to give the impression that machine made furniture is not good, or that it has not a beauty of its own, or that a majority of the designs are not graceful and well adapted to the days in which it was executed. In fact, I am of the belief that woodworking machinery has proved a blessing to both producer and user of cabinet work, while at the same time it has proved almost fatal to the distinctive and individual beauty of artistic handmade furniture. -The object of the writer of this book, is to aid the young cabinet-maker — and the old one too — in obtaining a knowledge of the art from A to Z, and to enable him to take his material from the rough, and work it up until it reaches a finished state ready to take the place for which it was intended. I also purpose reproducing a number of designs of, what was generally considered to be some of the finest examples of furniture, from which the young workman and designer, may absorb inspiration and give to his work a charm -and character to such work as he may undertake to execute, that can never be conveyed to articles made by the machine. -It may be said, and with justice, that there is little or no demand for handmade art furniture, but I am persuaded this condition is occasioned because of the little of it there is jn the market, and the very high prices demanded for it by the owners. These high prices are placed on the articles, not by the maker, designer or workman, but by dealers, and the prices are often from four to five times the actual cost of the original work, and are only bought by rich people, whereas, if the prices were normal, the middle classes, whos\\'e taste is equal — and often superior — to that of the very rich, would indulge in handmade work to a very much larger extent than they now do. -The bright sharp workman, of whom there are hundreds in our cabinet factories, who have been trained from the lumber yards to the running of the most delicate machinery in the shop, who by a little study, and a little practical work, may soon become able to make and finish furniture — by hand — of the finest sort, furniture too, that will find a ready market if the maker does his best. Many fine pieces of furniture have been made by advanced students after work-hours or during holidays. I have in mind at this writing, a splendid oak side-board, that was made in Newark, N. J., by a young man who was serving some years in a furniture -shop, in that city, as an apprentice. The work was all done by hand, and in a shed in the rear of the house, polishing and all. The sideboard was intended for his father, but a wealthy neighbor of the latter, a man of taste, seeing the work before it was quite completed, offered to buy it, and thus, when finished was sold for the sum of $280.00. The materials, including mirrors, stained and leaded glass, hardware, and other stuff, all told, cost about $55.00. When it is considered, the work was done, nearly all after hours, between the fifteenth of October and the end of April, the amount was quite a comfortable addition to the young man\\'s slender yearly salary. But the money gained, was but a fraction of the benefit he derived, as the experience, and the knowledge obtained in making the furniture, were worth to him many times the money he received for it. -Of course, I do not think every apprentice, or even a large percentage of them, could make such pieces of furniture, or find purchasers for them after they were made, but every apprentice or student could make something, that would be useful and ornamental, and have a cash value, besides opening a way for the cultivation of a broader and more exact artistic taste. -Taste was the founder of all our styles in furniture from the prehistoric log stool all the way down through the Egyptian, Babylonian, Chinese, Greek, Roman, Medieval, Byzantine, French, Gothic and the more -modern styles of Chipendale, Shereton, Adams, and our colonial styles, and it is essential that every cabinetmaker who aspires to know his business, should cultivate taste, make himself conversant with the various styles, and be able at a glance to tell to what style, or on what lines any given piece of furniture is intended to represent. -In this connection, I may say, it is proposed to lay before my readers a chapter or two on the various styles of furniture, with illustrations, explanations and some details. It is also intended to offer some instructions for performing such work as gilding, staining, polishing, and finishing the work complete. -There are but a few books of value, on the art of cabinet-making, available to the American reader, though in French, and German, and even in Italian, there are quite a number, but most of their renderings would be of little use to the English or American workman, however, I will try and cull from them, whatever I deem suitable to these pages. The cullings from these works will consist mostly of illustrations, representing some of the best works of French, Italian, and German masters, with such explanations as may be necessary. The only American work, of a real practical nature, that I have any knowledge of is, first, Cabinet-maker\\'s Companion, by J. Stokes, published by Henry Carey Baird, Philadelphia, Pa., 1870. This is an excellent little work and contains quite a number of good re-ceipts on dyeing, staining, and other useful matter. Another book, a still more modern one by Alvan Crocker Nye, Ph. B. and deals nearly altogether with the constructional principle of cabinet-making, but it has little to say regarding the styles or historical peculiarities of furniture. This book is published by Wm. Comstock, New York, and is dated 1900. Some other Manuals are very good in their way, but they are written chiefly for boys who have had little or no experience in woodworking, and who may not intend making Cabinet-making a life work, are suited more for amateur workers rather than for those intending to follow woodworking for a living. These manuals however, will prove useful to every one who intends to work in wood, either professionally or a,s an amateur. -There have been many essays on the art of furniture making, in our journals and art magazines, but these have generally been of an academic character, with a few exceptions, and have proved but of little service to the practical workman. -A brief history of furniture and its growth, may not be out of place, though I do not purpose going into the subject at great length, so I will devote one illustrated chapter only to it. -The first well-known reference to woodwork is to be found in the Book of Genesis in the instructions given to Noah to make an Ark of \"Gopher Wood,\" to make a window, to pitch it within and without with pitch, and to observe definite measurements. From the specific directions thus handed down to us we may gather that mankind had acquired at a very early period of the World\\'s history a knowledge of the different kinds of wood, and the use of the various tools. -We know also, from the various bas-reliefs and papyri to be found in the World\\'s museums, how advanced were the Old Egyptians in the arts of civilization, and that the manufacture of comfortable and even luxurious furniture was well known. It is quite evident the Hebrews must have had the best of workmen for their teachers and taskmasters to have enabled them to acquire sufficient skill and experience to carry out such precise instructions as were given for the building of the ark, and the erection of the Tabernacle, the latter of which was built some 1 500 years before Christ — as to the kinds of wood, measurements, ornaments, fastenings (loops and taches), curtains of linen, and coverings of dried skins. We have only to turn for -a moment to the 25th chapter of Exodus to be convinced that all the directions there mentioned were given to a people who had considerable experience in the methods of carrying out work, which must have resulted from some generations of cabinet-makers, carpenters, joiners, weavers, dyers, goldsmiths, and other craftsmen. -A thousand years before Christ, we have those descriptions of the building and fitting by Solomon of the glorious work of his reign, the great temple, and of his own, \"the King\\'s house,\" which gathered from different countries the most skilful artificers of the time, an event which marks an era of advance in \\'the knowledge and skill of those who were thus brought together to do their best work towards carrying out the grand scheme. It is worth while, too, when we are referring to Old Testament information bearing upon the subject, to notice some details of furniture which are given, with their approximate dates as generally accepted, not because there is any particular importance attached to the precise chronology of the events concerned but because, speaking generally, they form landmarks in the history of furniture. One of these is the verse (2 Kings chap, lv) which tells us the contents of the \"little chamber in the wall,\" when Elisha visited the Shunamite, about B. C. 895; and we are told of the preparations for the reception of the prophet: \"And let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool -and a candlestick.\" Another incident is some 420 years later, when, in the allusion to the grandeur of the Palace of Ahasuerus, we catch a glimpse of Eastern magnificence in the description of the drapery which furnished the apartment: \"Where were white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple, to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble.\" (Esther 1:6). -There are, unfortunately, no trustworthy descriptions of ancient Hebrew furniture. The illustrations in Kitto\\'s Bible, Mr. Henry Soltau\\'s \"The Tabernacle, The Priesthood and the Offerings,\" and other similar books, are apparently drawn from imagination, founded on descriptions in the Old Testament. In these, the \"table for shew-bread\" is generally represented as having legs partly turned, with the upper portions square, to which rings were attached for the poles by which it was carried. As a nomadic people, their furniture would be but primitive, and we may take it that as the Jews and Assyrians came from the same stock, and spoke the same language, such ornamental furniture as there was would, with the exception of the representations of figures of men or of animals, be of a similar character. At least this is what Litchfield says, and he is no mean authority. -Doubtless prehistoric men made use of stones, logs, or piled-up sods, for seats, and for spots to rest their -heads ; the use of stones for pillows being quite common as late as early historic times. Be this as it may however, we find, the Egyptians had chairs, beds, tables and other furniture, some of which was highly wrought and ornamented, at least 4000 years before Christ, as shown by the monuments, and by the papyri that have come down to us. We also possess some fragments of bronze furniture of both Egyptian and Assyrian make. -The British Museum and the Louvre contain a few Egyptian chairs or seats that have been made in ebony and ivory, which owe their preservation to the lasting nature of the material. -Two Egyptian chairs or thrones are illustrated at Figs. 1 and 2, in the first part of this work. At Fig. 3, cabinet-makers are represented as occupied in chair making, the feet and legs of the chairs being designed from animals\\' limbs, and the stools on which the workmen are sitting are blocks of wood hollowed out at the top. The Egyptian couch was of a straight-lined design in the body with a curved head like an ordinary sofa, the legs, feet and other salient points being carved with heads, feet and tails of animals. -Some boxes and coffers with gable tops dovetailed together, small toilet boxes having carved or painted decoration, and Mummy cases of cedar-wood having elaborate hieroglyphic decorations, may be seen in the British Museum and in the Louvre. Chariot and horse furniture are well represented in the reliefs and wall -paintings. Egypt was famed for chariot building, and exported them in trade to the surrounding nations. We read that King Solomon imported his war-chariots from Egypt. -If examples of Egyptian furniture are scarce, the furniture of Assyria is practically non-existent, as the climate of the latter country was not so dry or preservative as that of Egypt, so that all examples thathave not been wilfully destroyed have long ago perished. Many ornaments of bronze and of ivory decorations have been discovered that have been used as mountings to feet, ends of legs of seats, chairs, or thrones. The -bas-reliefs of the latter enables us to form a fairly accurate judgment of the nature and style of Assyrian furniture, the decoration of which was of a heavier and coarser character than that of the more elegant Egyptian ( Fig. 4 and 5 ) . Forms and parts of animals -were used by the Assyrians and nearly all Oriental nations as furniture decorations. The human figure was also used, but generally in the representation of slaves or conquered peoples, who were degraded to the position of bearing the weight of the seat or throne of the monarch. The Egyptian chairs had also carved human figures as captives tied under the seat. -The furniture of the Hebrews was doubtless of the same kind as the Assyrian. From the description of King Solomon\\'s throne it was apparently similar to those of the Assyrian kings. It had lions for the arm supports, and had six lions in gold and ivory on the six steps on either side of the throne. -In the manufacture of the furniture of the nations of antiquity the principal materials were — in woods, ebony, rosewood, walnut, pine, teak, and, above all, cedarwood; ivory, gold, silver, bronze, and electrum were also much used for inlays and for solid mountings. -The furniture and the chariots of the Greeks in their early period were simply copied from Egyptian and Asiatic sources, with less of the animal forms and more of plant forms as decorative details (Figs. 6, 7). Folding stools and chairs were made in wood and in metal and the backs of the chairs Fl ^ re 4 were upright, or nearly so -(Figs. 8, 9 and 10) ; couches resembling modern sofas, elaborate foot-stools, and arm-chairs with the sphinxes for the arms were made by the Greeks. -In the British Museum are some small models of Greek chairs made in lead, and wooden boxes showing the dovetail construction. -In the later Greek periods the furniture was inlaid with ivory, ebony, gold, and silver. Tripods were made of bronze, and had ornamented legs in the shapes of the limbs of lions, leopards, and sphinxes. The Roman bronze tripods were very similar to the Grecian ones -in design, and were not only used for sacred purposes in the temples, but also to support braziers for heating purposes, or for burning perfumes in the houses of private people (Fig. 10). -Hand-mirrors and cistae were made in great quantities in bronze or in other metal alloys, in silver, and -sometimes in gold. The mirrors were polished on the face, and had often rich designs of figure subjects. The Greek cistae were cylindrical metal boxes that rested on feet designed from those of various animals, having a lid or cover, with a handle or knot usually of figure design, the whole surface of the body being covered with engraved figure compositions and ornamental borders. They were probably used to contain jewelry -and trinkets. Some very fine specimens of these handmirrors and cistae may be seen in the British Museum. -The furnishing of the houses of the Romans was very much of the same character as that of the Greeks -The interior plan and aspects of the Roman houses were such as those of Pompeii and Herculaneum. Tables and tripods of bronze or braziers were supported -on three legs, some of which were made with hinges for folding purposes (Fig. n), and others were of sphinx and animal forms of a rich design (Fig. 12). Lamp-stand designs were quaint and elegant and were -made in bronze (Fig. 13). Candelabra of architectural design were carved in marble and were from six to ten feet in height (Fig. 15). -The Romans highly prized and paid good sums for tables that were made from the pollard cross grain of different hard woods in which the knots and grain showed to advantage, the beauty of the wood being brought out by hand-polishing and by the staining it -with various colored dyes. Bird\\'s eye maple and the wood of the cedrus atlantica were much prized. The smaller tables, abaci, rested usually on one foot— monopodium — and larger tables had three or four legs, -which had ivory claws or heads of animals as carved decoration (Fig. 14). Boxwood, beech, and palm, inlaid with ivory, ebony, and precious metals, were used in the materials of chairs and couches. The latter were often made in bronze (Figs. 15 and 16), and chairs of state were carved in marble, one of this kind being in the Louvre, a cast of which is now in the Kensington Museum (Fig. 17). The form of the Roman curule chair was like the letter X, and was so called because it -could be folded and carried easily in the curules or chariots. It was used from the earliest times of the Romans down to modern days in Italy, and was often constructed of elephants\\' tusks, wood, or metal, with ivory feet. The curule chairs were carried about for outdoor use and for the theatre. The sella or bisellium. -to seat two persons, was often a very ornate kind of seat with turned legs similar to the couches (Fig. 18). -In the houses of the Romans a separate room or wardrobe was fitted up to keep the dresses and cloths of the family ; this room had cupboards with doors and shelves, drawers, and lockers. -Portable coffers and chests were used, in which they packed their cloths and valuables when carrying them to and from their town and country houses. The Roman furniture and wooden construction of their houses were decorated with paintings and carvings of animals\\' heads, limbs, and feet, and with the usual architectural acanthus foliage — veneering of woods was an art in which the Romans were skilled; both large and small design in Tazsia work were the chief decorations of the best furniture. -The representations we have of what was used by the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans, are those only of the most finished and tasteful specimens; and, consequently, materials do not exist for the formation of a chronological series. But if we examine such as are of subsequent date in Europe, the reply will be found amply to repay the trouble. -In endeavoring to obtain some little insight into the forms and materials of the furniture of ancient times, we are dependent on different sources, according to the country under consideration. If it be ancient Rome or Greece, the descriptions by the classical writers and the paintings at Pompeii are our chief authorities; if ancient Egypt, the paintings on the walls at Thebes and other places ; if in China or India, or Asia generally, the specimens still existing, for the Asiatics are more stationary in their usages than the inhabitants of any other quarter of the globe. Footstools seemed to have formed part of the furniture of a sitting-room; -they were made both solid and open at the sides, and were covered at the top with leather or interlaced string. -The distinction between a bed and a couch does not seem to have been very clearly marked. They had couches of wood with one end raised and receding in a graceful curve, with feet fashioned to resemble those of some wild animal. It is supposed that those couches had a rich covering by day and bedding by night. The use of wooden pillows was customary ; they were made of various materials, according to the rank of the possessor, and had a singular kind of cavity in which the head or the back of the neck might rest. Wicker bedsteads were sometimes made of palmbranches, forming a light kind of grating on which the bed and bedding were placed. The tables used were of various forms — round, square and ob-lar, and supported by a central pillar, which was often the figure of a man as a captive. Other tables had three or four legs, and the material of the tables themselves, though generally wood, was sometimes metal or stone. -It is curious to remark that Egypt exhibited, three or four thousand years ago, articles of furniture bearing a much closer resemblance to those of modern Europe than Egypt does at the present day. The chairs of the early times might in many cases be readily mistaken for those now in use among ourselves; whereas the divans and cushions of modern Egypt, on which the natives indolently recline, belong to the oriental system of furniture. In Cairo no chambers are furnished as bed-rooms. The bed, in the day-time, is rolled up and placed on one side, or in an adjoining closet, which is a sleeping-place in the winter. In summer many persons sleep upon the house-tops. The furniture of a room is comprised pretty nearly by the mat or carpet spread upon the floor, and the divans or cushioned couches. For meals a round tray is brought in and placed upon a low stool, and the company sit round it on the ground. There is no fire-place, the room being warmed when necessary by charcoal burning in a chafing-dish. -Passing from Egypt to China, we find, in treating of the furniture of a room, as in many other matters, how singularly isolated the Chinese are from the other -nations of Asia, and how much more closely they resemble Europeans. The Chinese are the only Asiatic -people who customarily use chairs; they resemble the solid and heavy chairs in fashion during the early part of the 1 8th century; (see illustration of Chinese chair). The seat of the chair has often a cushion, and the back a hanging of scarlet silk or woolen embroidered with silk. In the forms of their Figure 17 furniture the Chinese gen-erally avoid straight and uniform lines; even in their doorways, instead of a regular right-angled opening, they often have one presenting the form of a circle, or an oval, or a leaf, or a jar. These fanciful doorways, however, are only used when there are no doors, the opening being covered with hanging screens of silk or cloth, or with bamboo blinds, like those used in India. The Chinese beds are generally simple in form, with cotton or silk curtains in winter, and a fine mosquito-screen during the heat of summer; the bed of an individual among the middle classes usually consists of two or three boards laid upon a couple of narrow benches, a mat to lie upon, and four bamboo-sticks to support the mosquito-curtains. It may readily be sup-posed that in the original country of porcelain a very usual ornament of dwellings consists in vases and jars of that material, of which the antiquity is valued above -every other quality. This taste has led to the manufacture of fictitious antiques, not only in porcelain, but in bronze and other substances — points in which strangers are lgure often very egregiously -taken in at Canton. The shapes of their tripods and other ancient vessels, real or imitated, are often fantastical, and not unlike similar vestiges in Europe. -The furniture, such as tables, chairs, beds, and the chariots of the Byzantine period, was like the architecture in having something of the classic Roman mixture with some Asiatic Greek forms in its design. Scarcely any remains of such are now in existence, although we have evidences of the extreme richness of the sumptuary furniture and vessels of the great houses and palaces of Constantinople, for owing to the decadence and destruction of the Roman empire in the provinces, the capital of the East became enriched by treasures of the Roman families, who naturally fled to Constantinople for protection for themselves and their valuable effects. -different varieties of seats, chairs, and footstools, on which the consuls are seated, represented in the carving. Many originals of these and casts from others, are now in the Kensington Museum, London. -The chair of St. Maximian, preserved at Ravenna, is covered with ivory carvings, and is one of the finest examples of Byzantine work. -Much of the furniture of the early centuries of Christian art is represented in the Byzantine illuminated manuscripts. Beds and couches kept the old Roman forms with the turned legs. Chariots must have been used very much, as the old game of chariot racing was kept up by the Byzantines. The Iconoclasts of the Eastern Empire under Leo the Isaurian (A. D. 726) — -whose injurious rule lasted about one hundred and twenty years — were responsible for much destruction -of sumptuary furniture, as well as for other productions of an artistic nature, but at the same time they were the indirect means of causing a new development in art in the western parts of Europe, and more particularly in -the Rhenish Provinces, by driving the Byzantine artists and craftsmen to these places, where they were welcomed by Charlemagne, and by his powerful nobles and churchmen. In the course of time they succeeded in founding the school of art known as Rhenish-Byzantine. The finest illustrations of this art are seen in the magnificent enamelled reliquaries or shrines. The giltbronze chair of Dagobert is of Romanesque design, and is one of the earliest pieces of furniture of the Middle Ages (see Fig. 19). Another mediaeval chair or throne is high seated, and exceedingly rich in design (Fig. 20). It is of Scandinavian origin, and is a good example of the Romanesque style of Northern Europe. Many forms of the Romanesque are seen in the furniture and carving of the Gothic style that immediately succeeded the former. -During the Anglo-Saxon period in England the ordinary houses usually consisted of one room. Sometimes a shed-like structure was erected against the wall of the room to contain the bed of the mistress of the house, and as a rule the inmates slept on a large table placed in the center of the room, or on benches on which bags of straw were placed. Seats without backs, or stools, long settles or benches with backs and carved ends or arms, were the chief articles in furniture. -After the Norman Conquest domestic improvements were multiplied, more rooms were added to the houses, such as the solar or upper room, and the parlor or -talking room, and some of the rooms had fireplaces, but not chimneys. The principal room was the hall or assembly-room, which had a fireplace in the center, the smoke escaping through the lantern light in the roof. In the Norman times the principal additions to the furniture of English manor-houses and castles were the cupboard, presses or armoires, and chests. These pieces -of furniture were introduced from France. Sometimes the portable presses and the chests were painted with tempera decorations, and were bound with wroughtiron clasps and hinges, which were just beginning to come into use. -The bed-clothes and personal clothing of the nobles and rich landowners began to assume a rich character, and were often embroidered. -Tapestry and painted cloth hangings were imported ; also pottery of an ornamental description was not only imported, but made in England at this time. All this -applies to the homes of the rich only, for the poorer classes remained for a long period in a very primitive condition as regards their style of houses and their furniture. -The construction of furniture and the panelling of chests began to exhibit some workmanlike appearances of good carpentry. Panels were placed in framework that was mortised and fastened with wooden pegs, which became the universal method of panelling throughout the Gothic period. Room paneling came into use in England in the early part of the thirteenth century, Figure 23 when pine timber was used at first -for this work, but was displaced later by the more substantial oak. This oak panelling during the Gothic periods was often carved with elaborate tracery of an architectural character (Figs. 21, 22), and a common design was a carved imitation of a carefully folded textile, known as the \"linen panel\" (Fig. 23). -Chests were used as tables, and the tops had inlaid checkers to be used as chessboards. They were also used as sideboards on which to place dishes of food, the dining-table being a board which was placed on trestles, that could be removed and packed away when not required (Figs. 24, 25). A crossed-legged chair and a three-legged stool is shown at Fig. 2j, which -were common shapes in the fourteenth century. The illustration, Fig. 26, is that of a bedroom of the same -period, and is taken from an English manuscript of the date of 1400. For these illustrations, and many others -on the subject of furniture, we are indebted to the work of Mr. J. H. Pollen on \"Furniture and Woodwork.\" -The bed in the latter illustration has a flat canopy, or tester, with embroidered hangings. The walls of the room are panelled, and the floor is in checkered par-quetry. There is a curious seat that is partly an open press, with pottery, and metal vases placed as decoration on the top. -Chests, trunks, or bahuts, were at this period, and in the time of the Normans, the most important articles in furniture; they were often made with inlaid wood decorations, and had strapwork of iron and ornate -hinges. They were the usual repositories of the household valuables, money, and other treasures, and were carried on horses or mules when the family moved about from place to place. By degrees the chest, with the addition of a back and arms, became the settles or principal seats in the living-room, and the back developed with an added hood or projecting covering into -Another and later development of the chest was to raise it on legs, and to add a back arrangement to it, with shelves for the display of household plate, to which was given the name of dressoir, or dresser, the latter in time developing into the modern sideboard. -Chests were also important articles of church furniture, in which the sacred vessels, treasures, books, and priests\\' garments couljd be locked up, and a particular -form of chest kept in church vestries was the cope chest, which took the semicircular shape of the copes when laid out flat in these chests. Examples of these chests are still to be seen in some of the larger cathedrals. -The coronation chair (Fig. 28) gives a good idea of a state chair of the early Gothic period in England. -Carriages of the fourteenth century were used for the conveyance of women and children, but were not very common. They were longshaped covered vehicles on four wheels, with or without paneled sides, and were painted and decorated (Figs. 29, 30). Carts for carrying and for agricultural purposes were used in the Anglo-Saxon and Norman periods in England, and in France at the same dates; these were twowheeled vehicles, each being usually of one solid piece of wood. -The Saracens were very ingenious in the using of wood, as in carpentry, carving, and turning in the lathe. Their ingenuity and skill in carpentry and turning is seen in the Meshrebiya work and lattice, and in the carvings of the pulpit and door panels. -Regarding the furniture of the domestic dwellings of the Saracens, whether of Egypt, Arabia, or elsewhere, there was very little of a movable nature except the small tables and reading-desks. The tables of Saracenic design are usually small and of a greater height than width ( Fig. 31). These tables or kursys are sometimes panelled with turned, latticed, or carved decoration, having stalactites under the top, as in the illustration, -or in the kursys of a lighter construction are generally inlaid with ivory, ebony, and mother-of-pearl. Some of the richest variety are hexagonal in shape, are inlaid with brass and silver filigree ornamentation, and are of splendid workmanship. The next important article in movable furniture is the Saracen reading-desk, which is made in the form of a camp-stool, with cross legs. It is usually inlaid and decorated like the tables. -The divans are platforms raised slightly from the ground, and covered with cushions on the seats and backs. The carved cupboards or shelves on brackets -placed behind and above the divans, on which vases and trays are kept for ornament or when not in use, complete the usual furniture. of the Saracenic livingroom. Seats or chairs or lattice-work (dikkas), on -which the doorkeeper sits, are usually found in entrance-halls, and if we add the elaborate metal and colored-glass lamps, the vases, the large metal salvers or trays, and the rugs and carpets, the furniture of a Saracenic house is complete. -In the early part of the fifteenth century and during the whole of the century the furniture of Europe generally was designed more or less on Gothic lines, but gradually the new forms that were now rapidly developing in the architecture of the Renaissance, but in a slower measure, began to assert themselves in furniture designs. Consequently, we find in many articles, such as armoires or presses, and cabinets, a mixture of style in the design — as, for instance, the upper panels would be in the Mediaeval, and the lower ones in the Renaissance style, or the general construction would be Gothic, and the details and decoration would be Italian. -This was more often the case in the furniture and other art in Germany, where the Renaissance was tardily welcomed. -Styles of design in furniture overlap each other so much, especially in the Renaissance period, that it became very difficult to assign a correct date to many pieces of important work. Gothic designs continued to be used during the sixteenth century, although the Renaissance had been developing for a hundred years -earlier. The most authentic means of fixing the date is when certain work can be proved to have come from the hand of a particular artist, or when there is a record of its having been made for a king or some great person, for the style is not always a sure proof of the correct date. -In the \"Quattrocento\" period (1400-1500), or fifteenth century, Italian furniture made for churches, palaces, or private houses, was usually decorated with paintings, sometimes on a gilt ground, which was prepared in a gesso material before the gold was applied, some parts of which had relief ornamentation. -Reliquaries, altar-fronts, panels or cabinets, chests, and marriage coffers were decorated in this way. -The work known as \"tarsia,\" or certosina work, was made in great perfection about this time in Italy. It is inlaid work of a geometric character in design, or is composed of floral ornament, and sometimes consists of representations of landscapes and buildings. This kind of inlay derived from Persian sources, was developed chiefly by the Venetians, and was used mostly by them in the decoration of their stalls, tables, chairs, cabinets, &c. Ebony, ivory, and metals were also employed in the Italian inlays of this period. -The Italian cassoni, or marriage coffers, were the most ornate and most imposing articles of furniture of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. They were placed in the long halls and corridors of the palaces and great -houses, and were usually given as presents to newly married couples. They were generally used as the receptacle for the bride\\'s trousseau and other treasures. In the latter century they were carved in walnut with sculptural mythological subjects, and had endings or corners of half-figures and half-foliage, as caryatids, -with feet designed from the claws of animals to raise them from the ground (Fig. 32). The carving was relieved by gilding in parts, and sometimes the whole of it was gilt. -Other examples of an earlier date were covered with a finely modelled decoration of gesso work, and gilded, and in other cases the large panels in the front were painted with figure subjects in brilliant colors and heightened with gold. -A less costly kind of marriage coffer was made in cypress-wood, and fitted up in the inside with drawers, having the decoration on the surface engraved or etched -in brown lines, with the ground slightly recessed and punched or stamped with a fine ornamentation. -In the Kensington Museum there is an extensive collection of Italian cassoni embracing all the above varieties. Chairs carved and gilt of the same style and period as the coffers were usually placed between the rows of the latter in the halls of the Italian palaces (Fig. 33). These chairs had their backs and legs richly carved, each part being made out of a single slab of wood. -The pair of bellows (Fig. 34) is a further illustration of the design and excellence of workmanship as shown in the work of the wood carvers of Italy in the sixteenth century, or \"Cinquecento\" period. -Another fine specimen of wood carving is the Italian stool (Fig. 35) of the same date, which is remarkable for its delicacy of treatment. -Another form of chair of a rectangular character, with or without arms, having an embossed leather or velvet covering on the back and seat, with turned and carved legs and rails, was made in Italy about this time (Fig. 36) ; it was much used subsequently in Spain, France, and in England, and has continued to be in favor down to the present day. -Cabinets were made in Italy and in France in which slabs of beautifully colored and veined marbles and rare stones were inserted as panels in various shapes, to which the name of \"pietradura\" work was given. -In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries painted plaques of porcelain took the place of these marbles. -In England, France, Spain, and Germany, the great houses, both private and religious, and the king\\'s palaces were elaborately furnished, and kept in a state of great splendor. -Churches were also furnished with elaborate stalls, pulpits, and rich utensils, but in the latter the style of the designs was still Mediaeval. -In the reigns of Henry VII. and Henry VIII. in England the style gradually altered to the Italian forms of the Renaissance, and great quantities of Italian, Flemish, and French furniture were largely imported. Jean de Mabuse and Torrigiano were employed as architects and sculptors by Henry VII. , and Holbein and some Italian artists designed furniture and goldsmith\\'s work for Henry VIII. -In France, during the reigns of Francois I., Catherine de Medici, and Henry II., a great activity took place in architecture and in all the industrial arts, in which that country was not only imitated, but sought to excel, the work of the Italian schools. -As already mentioned, the French kings and Medicean princesses in the sixteenth century had invited from Italy Cellini, Primaticcio, II Rosso, Serlio, and others, who succeeded in founding the style of the Renaissance in France, and about the same time many French artists journeyed to Italy to acquire the newer style which had been evolved from the study of the old classic remains of that country. Among the names of the principal French artists, sculptors, and carvers of this period are those of Jean Goujon, Nicholas Bachelier of Toulouse, Jean Cousin, Germain Pilon, Philibert de L\\'Orme, Du Cerceau, who published -designs for all kinds of decorations and carvings, and Hugues Sambin of Dijon. Most of these men were -architects and also designers of the heavy and rich furniture that was characteristic of the French Renaissance. Some of these artists and their works have been noticed in the chapters on Renaissance architecture and metal work. The cabinet (Fig. 37) is a good example of the architecturic style of French furniture of the sixteenth century. French wood carving is distinguished from the -Italian of this period by the great use of the cartouche and strap-work (Fig. 38), which was so characteristic of the Henri-Deux style. -When the Renaissance had taken a firm root in Germany, the designers and carvers of altar-pieces and of furniture generally proved themselves thorough masters of the style, and were especially skilful in the carving of wood, both on a gigantic and on a minute scale. Whole fronts of houses were elaborately carved in designs consisting of figure work, animals, ornament, and grotesques of a quaint and humorous description, while exceedingly minute works of figure subjects and animals were carved in box and other woods with a delicacy and quaintness often excelling the ivory carvings of the Japanese. Escritoires, buffets, cabinets, and other furniture, were made and exported from Germany into Spain and other countries. -Flemish and English furniture and carving were pretty much alike in the reigns of Elizabeth — the Tudor period of English art — and of James L, the Stuart of Jacobean. The pieces of carved furniture, both Flemish and English, were very solid and heavy both in the design and thickness of material, which was generally of oak or chestnut. So much Flemish furniture was imported into England at this time, and the Englishmade work, being so close in resemblance to the former, that a great difficulty is experienced in classifying examples of this period. The table, Fig. 39, and the socalled \"Great Bed of Ware,\" are examples of the furniture of the Elizabethan period (Fig. 40). -duced in the first instance by the great importations from Italy and Germany, but under such excellent native carvers and designers as Felipe de Borgona (six-teenth century), and Berruguete (i 480-1 561), the style of the Renaissance soon spread from Toledo to Seville and Valladolid, where great quantities of carved and inlaid work and elaborate altar-pieces were executed during the prosperous Spanish period of the sixteenth century. -During the same century Venice and Florence were famed for their marquetry — inlaid work of ivory and metal — in cypres s, walnut, and other woods, which art -had been imported from Persia and India by the Venetians, and which spread rapidly through Europe until the furniture made with marquetry decoration by degrees supplanted the heavier classical architectural designs. -Before leaving the Italian sixteenth-century work we must notice the mirrors, with their elaborately carved frames of Venetian design and manufacture. In this century Venice was renowned for the making of glass, for which it is still famous, and certain privileges were granted by the State exclusively to Venetian manufacturers of looking-glasses. Two Murano glass makers named Andrea and Dominico, who were the inventors, were granted in the year 1507 the sole privilege of making \"mirrors of crystal glass\" for a term of twenty years. Previous to this time the mirrors -were made of various polished metals. The frames of the Venetian mirrors were often elaborately carved (Fig. 41), some of them being made in designs that were strictly architectural in character, representing a door, or window frame, with pilasters frieze, and cornice and sill or plinth. These carved frames were often part or wholly gilt, and were exported in considerable quantities. Pictures were framed in a similar way to the mirrors, and carved and gilt frames were soon used all over Europe as picture frames. Later on gilt furniture of all kinds was made in Venice and was in great favor in the other countries of the Continent. -The manufacture of marquetry furniture by the Dutch in the seventeenth century has been mentioned as having helped in a great measure to change the style of furniture design from its former architectural character to a greater simplicity of construction. Large panel surfaces were used for the purpose of showing to greater advantage the rich and bright colors of different kinds of hard woods used in the marquetry. Both natural and stained varieties of various wood were arranged in the designs in juxta-position, and a free and picturesque kind of ornamental foliage was employed mixed with large tulips, roses, and birds in the Dutch marquetry decoration. Other materials such as ivory, ebony, and mother-of-pearl, were also used as inlays. In France a similar kind of marquetry -was developed, but the design consisted more of figure subjects and imitations of ruins in landscapes. A complete change in the design of the furniture in the latter country was also effected by the same desire to get large surface on which the inlaid work could be seen to great advantage, and the spaces were not divided by architectural mouldings, and the pilasters, as they had been in the preceding earlier work. Towards the end of the sixteenth century, and during the earlier half of the seventeenth, the sumptuous furniture, the beds, and general furnishing of the better class of houses and palaces in France and other European countries, were characterized by the use of costly silk brocades, tissues, and embroidered coverings and hangings. -By thus seeking to give the furniture an appearance of the richest possible kind, such articles as chairs, couches, and beds lost in a corresponding degree their elegance and former constructive beauty. Under their gorgeous Italian and Oriental velvet coverings, their framed construction ceased to be visible. The above pieces of furniture still retained their sumptuous upholstery during the reign of Louis XIV., but the tables, armoires. cabinets, book-cases, pedestals, clock-stands -and cases, came under the influence of the architecture of the period, when the king\\'s chief minister, Colbert, selected the best architects and cabinet-makers of the day to design the furniture for the palaces of the Tuileries, the Louvre, and Fontainebleau. -The greatest name connected with the design and manufacture of the magnificent furniture of the Louis-Quatorze period is that of Andre-Charles Boulle, whose work is known under his name as \"Boulle.\" This celebrated furniture is an elaborate kind of marquetry of which the materials are rare woods, ebony, tortoiseshell, brass, mother-of-pearl, and white metal or tin. The mountings, mouldings, and other salient points are made in brass beautifully chased and finished, some of the mouldings being in the forms of masks, foliages, cartouches, and animals\\' heads and feet as termination. Andre-Charles Boulle was born in Paris in the year -1642. His father, Pierre Boulle was also a distinguished ebeniste, or cabinet-maker, but his more eminent son possessed the artistic gift in a much higher degree. In addition to making his special marquetry from his own designs Boulle also executed a good deal of his best works from the design of Jean Berain ( 1636171 1 ), his chief collaborateur. Berain\\'s designs were more Italian in style, more symmetrical in the composition of the ornament, and more correct from an architectural point of view, than those attributed to Boulle himself, whose designs had much of the looseness and freedom of the prevalent Louis Ouatorze. -At the death of Jean Mace, the king\\'s ebeniste, in 1672, who had formerly lived in the royal galleries of the Louvre, the logement and office of ebeniste to the king had become vacant, and Boulle on the recommendation of Colbert, minister to Louis XIV., was appointed as the successor of Mace, and was installed in his rooms in the Louvre in the year 1673. He na< ^ previously executed some important work for the king, and was known as the ablest ebeniste at that time in Paris. -The origin of the Boulle marquetry can be traced to the Indian, Persian, and Damascus encrusted inlays in ivory, ebony, and metal, that found their way to Venice, Portugal, Spain, and France in the Middle Ages. These works consisted chiefly of caskets, coffers, and small pieces of furniture In the inventories of -Charles V. of France (1380) mention is made of lecterns and coffers of inlaid ivory or bone, in ebony, and similar works are mentioned in the inventories of Charles VI. (1418), and of Anne of Brittany (1498). These are the earliest notices of marquetry furniture that was made in France, and was probably an imitation of Oriental work. -In the Renaissance period Francois I. bought some magnificent furniture of Indian workmanship, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, from Portuguese merchants, and mention is made of chairs, tables, coffers, cabinets, and mirror-frames that belonged to Queen Marie de Medicis (1600), the Cardinal d\\'Amboise (1500), and other great persons of the French Court, all of which works were made in marquetry. -In France before the sixteenth century, tortoiseshell, brass, tin, and exotic woods were used as inlays, in addition to the ivory, ebony, and nacre of the East. From this it will be seen that Boulle did not invent the celebrated marquetry that bears his name. He, however, brought this sumptuous form of cabinet work to great perfection, and under the patronage of Louis XIV. he had every opportunity to develop his artistic abilities to the utmost. -The method of procedure in the making of the Boulle marquetry was, first, to prepare the veneers of wood, shell, tin, and brass of the same thickness, each having perfectly plain surfaces; these veneers were -then glued together in pairs of opposite materials, according to the nature of the effect required in the -finished work, and were held together firmly in a vice. The design was then traced on the surface of the upper leaf, and the veneers were then cut through the lines of -the pattern with a burin, a sharp strong knife, or a fine saw; thus four pieces of marquetry were made at one cutting. When the plaque forming the design was composed of tin or brass, which was afterwards engraved or chased, it was technically called \"boulle\" ; and when the design was formed by the shell or ebony it was called \"counter\"; the two effects are together known as \"boulle and counter\" or premiere et contrepartie. -A later kind of Boulle work, known as the Second Style, has the shell veneers laid on a clouded vermilion or on a gilt ground. -Boulle was an artist of great excellence as a sculptor and chaser of metals; his mountings of foliage and masks which decorated his works are spirited in design and are skilfully chased and finished (Fig. 42). He executed a great number of costly pieces of his famous marquetry for Louis XIV. and the Dauphin of France, many of which found their way to England a century later. Examples of Boulle work fetch great prices when, as on rare occasions, they make their appearance in a sale. -In Germany in the seventeenth century, the most prominent names as designers and makers of furniture are Philip Heinhofer, Baumgartner, and Hans Schwanhard. The former was the maker of the celebrated Pomeranian Cabinet (1611-1617) which is now in the Royal Museum at Berlin. -In this century, in Italy, Andrea Brustolone (16701732) was noted as a carver, gilder, and cabinet-maker who worked in the extravagant style of the Louis Quinze (Louis XV.), and in the first half of the -eighteenth century (1700-77) Pifetti, a Piedmontese cabinet-maker, was honored by the Italian Court, for which he executed many works in ivory carving and marquetry work in the style of Boulle. Many other cabinet-makers and carvers were employed to make furniture and to decorate the queen\\'s palace at Turin, among whom may be mentioned the names of Galleti, the successor of Pifetti, and Maggiolino of Milan, who -chiefly made a kind of marquetry in light woods. We are indebted to Mr. J. H. Pollen\\'s handbook on furniture for some of these names, and a list of many others will be found at the end of his useful book. -The French architect, Le Pantre (1617-82), designed furniture and decoration in the heavy classical style of the Roman antique, mixed with shell-work, grotesques, and little Cupids or \"putti,\" and also engraved and published a book of studies of Roman ornament from sketches that his master, Adam Phillipon, had made in Italy. He worked with Le Brun, the painter and director of the decoration at Versailles. Le Brun\\'s own work was heavy and dull, although he aimed at grandeur and gorgeousness of effect. He was director of the Gobelins tapestry manufactory, and his style of work was in harmony with the pompous ideas of Louis the \"Grand Monarch.\" Madame de Maintenon says in one of her letters to a friend, that Louis was so fond of symmetry and stateliness in his architecture, as in other things, that he would have you \"perish in his symmetry,\" for he caused his doors and windows to be constructed in pairs opposite to one another, which gave to everybody who lived in his palaces their death of cold by draughts of air. -In this century and early in the following one, the art of wood carving was greatly developed in England, chiefly owing to the genius of Grinling Gibbons and to the influence of Sir Christopher Wren, the style de-veloped being a more or less realistic or baroque form of the Renaissance (Figs. 44 and 45). Gibbons carried -out some of his carvings to an astonishing degree of realism: bouquets of flowers, festoons of fruit and flowers, birds, figures, and drapery were executed by him in the highest possible relief, which looked de-tached from the ground, and yet they usually formed a part of the solid wood with the background. Ornament was carved with a singular crispness, and apparently without any hesitation on the part of the carver. Though we may condemn the florid looseness of the style of Gibbons, we must admire the dexterity of workmanship and general technical excellence imparted to everything he touched. Some of his best work may still be seen at Chatsworth, Petworth House in Sussex, Lyme Hall in Cheshire, St. Paul\\'s Cathedral, and Trinity College Chapel at Oxford. -Under the Regency of Philippe d\\'Orleans in France (17 1 5-1 723) decoration and ornament assumed a light and fanciful character, very naturalistic, but still having some classic details; of this style Claude Gillot is the chief exponent. Watteau, his pupil, made a great name as a painter of pastoral scenes, fetes galantes, and all kinds of light and daintily-treated subjects of a theatrical and artificial kind of composition. His color was silvery and harmonious, and sometimes he decorated furniture with pastoral scenes. -The Rococo style had begun under the Regency, if not earlier, and such men as Oppenort, the De Cottes, father and son, Francois de Cuvillies, the Italians Bernini and Borromini, and lastly the great apostle of the Rococo, Meissonier, were all designers of furniture or architects who belonged to the period of Louis XV., and who executed works that reflected the loose and -unrestrained character of the times (1723-1774). Chinese and naturalistic elements were grafted on, or mixed with, the former Louis Quatorze, with an addition of still life that did duty for architectural form in objects of pottery and metal work, and a combination of shell work; all these elements made up the style known under the different names of rococo, rocaille, baroque, or Louis Quinze. -Furniture was made with curved and swelling panels to show to more advantage the marquetry, or paintings on gold grounds ; these kinds of panels and friezes were known as \"bombe.\" -It is said that the Italian architects, Bernini and Borromini, were the first to introduce the rococo style into France, but no designer went so far in the wilderness of its vagaries as the French Meissonier. His ornament furnishes a perfect example of the want of balance and symmetry. He designed for furniture, woodwork, silver-smithery, and modelled decoration, all of which work illustrated the broken shell-shaped panels with frilled and scalloped edgings and curved mouldings. -Rooms were lined with looking-glasses having these rocaille mouldings, which were well adapted to show to the best advantage the glitter of the gold leaf that was used inordinately on the furniture and decoration of the Louis-Ouinze period. -were the usual color decorations of ceilings, furniture, carriages, and a host of minor articles such as fans, etuis, snuff-boxes, &c. The latter smaller articles, as well as the state, carriages, were decorated with paint-ings in what was known as the Vernis-Martin style. Martin was a decorator of carriages and an heraldic painter, who invented the particular hard varnish or lacquer which bears his name. It was quite likely that this was as near as possible a successful imitation of the Japanese gold lacquer that decorated the articles which were at this period imported from Japan by the Dutch and Portuguese traders into Europe. Carriages, tables, cabinets, and especially smaller articles like snuff-boxes and needle-cases, were painted and decorated in \"Vernis-Martin.\" Some of the smaller objects were beautifully mounted in chased gold. -It was quite a common practice to cover or to panel furniture with plaques of Japanese lacquer, and to mount them in chased metal or ormoulu decorations. A unique commode is illustrated at Fig. 47, made from panels of very old Japanese lacquer and highly decorated with ormoulu mounts by Caffieri, a skilled chaser of the Louis-Quinze period. -In the latter half of the eighteenth century an improvement in the design of furniture and of ornament generally crept in, owing to the study of the ornamentation and design of the classic objects that had been found in the buried cities of Herculaneum and Pompeii. These cities had been discovered in 171 3, and about forty or fifty years later books were published illustrating the buried remains, which helped to change -The prevailing taste was then apparently gratified by the mixture or grafting of a certain quality of classic forms with the former frivolous style of the Louis Quinze. -The style in furniture and in ornament now developed into what is known as the \"Louis Seize\\'* (Louis XVI.), and consisted in its ornament of a composition of then scrolls, garlands, bows and quivers of arrows, ribbons and knots, medallions with classic cameo-cut subjects. Mouldings were fine and delicately ornamented and of straight line variety; in fact, the straight line now reasserted itself in architecture and furniture design (see Figs. 48, 49), in refreshing and healthy contrast to the tottering and riotous curves of Louis XV. and the Du Barry period. -Some of the most beautiful furniture expressive of the utmost elegance was made by Riesner and David, and was decorated with ormoulu mounts by Gouthiere for the Queen Marie Antoinette. Riesner and Gouthiere were the ablest men of their time, who generally worked together in the making and decorating of the finest furniture of this period. There is in the Jones Collection at South Kensington some of the very finest examples of this furniture, much of which was made for Marie Antoinette (Figs. 50, 51). -woods, such as tulip-wood, holly, maple, laburnum, purple-wood, and rosewood, for his marquetry work, and used oak for the linings and foundations. -The best pieces of David and Riesner were usually mounted in ormoulu or bronze-gilt metal by Gouthiere, who has never been equalled as a founder and chaser -of this class of work. Prieur was also a good chaser of the Louis Seize period. Delafosse was an architect and designer of furniture and decoration of the period, whose designs were of a more heavy and classical kind. Cauvet was a German who worked in Paris, and designed graceful arabesques and figure work, and who published a book of designs. Lalonde designed work that might be classed in the same category as that of Cauvet, and Salembier was a prolific designer of a light and free kind of arabesque. Many of his designs for silk may be seen in the fabric at the Silk Museum in the Bourse at Lyons. Le Notre designed for furniture, carving, and was also famed with La Quintinie as a designer of the state and public gardens. -In Italy the prevailing ornament in furniture and decoration was more classical than in France. Piranesi, Albertolli, Pergolese, and Bartolozzi are names of the principal designers of this country in the eighteenth century, most of whom published extensive works on ornament. The latter two were brought to England by the brothers John and Robert Adam (17281792), who had travelled in Italy, bringing also with them classical ideas, which they developed in England, and which influenced to a great extent the style of architecture and furniture design in this country. The Adelphi building and the houses in Portland Place were built from designs by the Adams. -&c., were made from their designs. Fine mouldings, medallions, rosettes, light garlands, capitals in classic form, fluted pilasters and columns, were all designed by them with the utmost restraint in style — even to coldness. -Thomas Chippendale was a famous cabinet-maker of the eighteenth century. His furniture, or even any good imitation of it, fetches a good price at the present time. He published a book on furniture design and interior decoration in the year 1764. His sons are supposed to have made nearly all the best of the mahogany furniture known as \"Chippendale.\" -The parlor chairs (Figs. 52 and 53) are good examples of Chippendale furniture, and the chairs made -well-known cabinet-makers, who made excellent mahogany furniture in the last century, both of whom published works on the subject at the latter end of the century. -The names of Gillow, Lichfield, Lock, and Copland are those of eminent cabinet-makers and decorators of -In France, after the Revolution (1792), more decided phase of the dry and heavy classicisms was apparent in the furniture design and decoration of the period ( 1801 ). This return to the classic heaviness has been attributed to the influence of the academic painter David, but is more likely to have been a pandering to the national worship of Napoleon and the French Empire. It seemed to have been the universal desire to make everything echo or reflect in some measure the glory of the Emperor Napoleon I. The meanest thing had some symbol or allusion by the way of decoration that should remind everybody of the greatness of the new monarch and of the French Empire, and consequently the heavy and ponderous style of that period was known as the \"Empire Style.\" The furniture of the Empire was usually made in mahogany, decorated with mountings in brass or bronze, of sphinxes, griffins, Roman emblems, and antique scrollery. -Percier and Fontaine are names of French cabinetmakers and designers who worked in the Empire style, and who published a book of their designs. (Fig. 55.) -In England the style was copied, and endless imitations of the French fashion in tables, sofas, chairs, cabinets, and clocks were designed after the same antique ideals. -century the mediaeval Gothic style was partly revived in architecture and in furniture, mainly owing to the efforts of W. Pugin, the architect. He designed many -pieces of furniture, and published a work consisting of Gothic designs in the year 1835. Notwithstanding the efforts of Pugin and some other eminent architects and \"purists,\" no particular lasting impression was made in this direction. -If we except a few of the best cabinet-makers\\' shops, where in the present day some furniture of good design -is made, the majority of such work is now made by machinery, or is often too much the work of the upholsterer, and is consequently less artistic and more mechanical in both design and construction. -Some of the most beautiful of Japanese and Chinese manufacture is made in carved wood and lacquered in black or red. Cabinets with drawers and quaintly contrived cupboards and recesses (Fig. 55) are made by the Japanese, finished in lacquers, and inlaid with ivory and mother of pearl. The Chinese are especially skilled in carving red lac-work. Some vases of great dimensions and of exquisite workmanship in this material may be seen in the various Museums. Lac-work is also executed with great skilfulness by the natives of India. Bracelets, armlets, or golias, are made of lac in various colors, the golden decorations of which are made from tinfoil and varnished with a yellow varnish made of myrrh, copal, and sweet oil boiled together. Boxes, bedposts, and other furniture, made in wood or papiermache, are lacquered and decorated with flat renderings of flowers and convenFigure 5: -tional shapes of animals and birds (Figs. 56, 57). All kinds of toys, weights and measures, cooking utensils, circular playing-cards, turnery, etc., are objects in small wares made in the choicest lac-work of India. -In looking back through the past ages, since the days of the supremacy of the Roman Empire, and after listening to the wonderful tales of the magnificent luxury and extreme prodigality of the sovereigns who reigned, and of the Lords and Ladies who lived in those times, we are led to suppose that the furniture of these palaces was of a kind that if it could be restored to its original splendour would strike our eyes in this present generation as something great in architectural beauty and dazzling in its gorgeousness. -We have learned to look with longing eyes on the Ottoman Empire as the place where luxurious ease has reached the highest attainable point within the limits of human skill, and think that the harem of the Turkish Vizier must be a sort of fairy palace lined with silk and satin, and full of couches so soft and easy that to recline on them is enough to send one to sleep. -If the truth were told, not one person in ten has anything like a proper idea of what furniture was in days gone by; and stranger yet, except in a few instances, people know very little about the finest furniture of the present day. One shop will turn out a bedstead, an-other a set of frames, and so on, but the people that make them seldom see them after they are finished, and in a house that is carpeted, curtained, and completely furnished, and if they did, would scarcely recognize them as the results of their handiwork. -The majority of people obtain their ideas of furniture, modern as well as ancient, from reading, and twothirds of the descriptions of furniture that are written are fabrications of some fertile brain that does not know a sideboard with a glass in it from a bureau. Therefore when we read accounts of ancient furniture and its great superiority over that in use now, first see whence the authority comes before believing it all. We have seen accounts of the magnificence of the furniture of the Romans in the time of Constantine ; of the tables and chairs inlaid with gold, silver, and precious stones ; of ease and barbaric splendour that was startling; whereas the same chairs and tables were as uncouth and cumbersome and uncomfortable as most people believe them to be comfortable and elegant. They may have been heavy with gems, but the gems were beautiful — not the chairs. -In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries more attention was paid to the architectural part of furniture than at any time before or since, but they lacked comfort, and we owe it to the French that instead of following the true principles of architecture and endeavouring to furnish luxury with art, they adopted a gaudy tinsel -style that had no art and little comfort. Marie Antoinette set a fashion of glitter and glare, and in her time more money was spent in gorgeous furniture than at any other since the dark ages, not even excepting the shoddy time within our own recollection. -Although there is much fault to be found with modern furniture, at no time has it been any better than it is now, to meet the wants of the people — and while we condemn the want of architectural merit, much, particularly in the richer classes, of the present day, is superior to that of the ancients. The furniture of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries had artistic merit and but little comfort, and was so rude in construction that the beauty of design was lost in the rough, unfinished look it presented, while today high finish, elegance of construction, and inviting look of comfort, do much to retard the introduction of pure architecture. When these two things, art and comfort, are combined, as they well may be, and soon will be, for we are glad to see the inclination in that way, it will be said years hence that the people of the nineteenth century were the first to turn out perfect furniture. We ought more properly to have said in the latter part of the nineteenth century, for perhaps nothing could be much An Old Cradle worse than the furniture of the earlier part, particu-lady here in our own land, for we had a mixture of the French, always bad, of the English, that was nondescript, and of the Puritans, that was — what shall we call it ? let it be nameless ; — we all know how it looked, and none would now care to use it. -The sumptuous furniture of old, is of itself sufficient to prove the truth of the statement which has been made as to the advances made during the period of wealth and luxury. One could not desire to see a more beautiful bedroom, for instance, than that in which James I. of England was accustomed to sleep during his visits to Knole, in Kent, and which is, to our minds, only the more attractive for a kind of grave stateliness that pervades the whole. The mothers of the present day may, perhaps, feel interested in knowing what kind of article a cradle was about three centuries ago; it was a species of box, or coffer on rockers, decorated elaborately with carvings. In later times French feeling crept into our furniture and, to our thinking, by no means improved it. -Illustrations of the elaborate and highly decorated character of the furniture belonging to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, are shown in our pages, from which our readers may derive some useful and suggestive hints from these reproductions. -There is, we know, of great power in this world, a certain fascinating spirit, called fashion; which controls the fancy, and compels it to a predilection, and, at -its pleasure, to a change of predilection, for forms and colors, and practices, quite independently of reason, and not seldom in the most direct opposition to commonsense. . -Fashion nevertheless is sometimes a brainless spirit, if the expression may be allowed of spirit; and without sense of good or evil. It will ally itself with taste, whether good or bad, and with moral order, good or bad. Among the Greeks of old, connecting itself with good taste (we wish we could add good morals) in its progress towards perfection, and maintaining the alliance, when perfection was attained. Fashion was of inestimable value. In some instances Fashion has been found capable of fixing a good moral order; and then of course it has been of worth still far more transcendant. But this brainless spirit, perhaps oftener has made bad taste immovable; of which the Chinese afford a great example. -But, among the Greeks, in architecture, in literature, even in dress, things were so settled, that one general character of Grecian taste has been the allowed criterion of perfection, for now about three thousand years. How was it that the spirit of fashion, among them, held such persevering connection with the spirits of common sence and good taste? Could it be because women were so excluded from general society as to have little influence in directing Fashion, or in supporting her in her wayward fancies? Surely the spirit of steadiness is not -alien from the English character : in graver matters we know it to be eminent. The famous \"Nolumus leges Angliae mutari,\" has been persevered in for centuries; and we may hope will be persevered in as long as the world shall last, or as long as it shall please providence that the English nation exist. But in matters of taste, certainly it has not been so. -There is not a demon more adverse to good taste than the spirit of Novelty. In matters of taste, as in almost everything, there are commonly many wrong ways for one right. Now the spirit of Novelty allows readily the passing from wrong to right ; but at no rate, the perseverance in right; whence wrong must, many times to one, with him, prevail. With this spirit, fashion has long, in this country, but especially of late days, held close alliance. Fashion has no will of her own ; but Novelty, though ever-changing, has, for the moment, a most determined one. Thus, Fashion still appearing the imperial lady, and Novelty but her minister, he easily leads her his own way. -In what high estimation both these whimsical spirits are held very extensively, net to say universally, among the ladies, is enough known. The ladies even in America rarely have their natural good taste improved, but often much perverted by education. Taught from infancy to revere the majesty of Fashion and to consider her sovereignty as not to be even decently opposed, with a living feeling for the charms of Novelty, they set -about their imperial business of furnishing a house. Ranging the fashionable upholsterers\\' warehouses, they feel themselves as in a sea of delights, but as in a vessel with a port to seek. Without a compass they look to Fashion as their polar star, their sails are filled by Novelty, and they give the helm to fancy. -The sky is clear, the weather most temperate; but under license of Fashion, Novelty, with his handmaid Variety, dispensing the winds, they are ever shifting. Fancy, distracted, grows giddy; her nerves falter, her hand shakes, her eyes twinkle, and she can no longer by day take the height of the sun, or by night with any certainty discover her polar star, a changeling polar star, Fashion. Thus distressed, the lady seeks advice from experience, and the cabinet-maker or upholsterer is called to her assistance. -Beyond all others the spirit of Novelty and Variety are objects of the upholsterer\\'s workshop. He professes infinite reverence for Fashion. But his loyalty is for the fashion that may happen to reign for the day : nor is it, like the Vicar of Bray\\'s, an ever acquiescing loyalty; on the contrary, he is ever aiming at revolution. The lady is aware of the unsteadiness of the reign of Fashion ; and not less anxious than the upholsterer to be prepared to adore the rising sun; but with this difference : he is always ready for revolution ; she devotes herself more to the present power, and dreads changes. in which others may be before her. Not wholly un-aware then of hazard in committing herself to his advice, having made her inquiries, and gained all attainable information, her purpose is to direct her upholsterer; but he is versed in the ways of leading her. -It behooves the cabinet-maker and upholsterer much to have talent in matters of taste, and to cultivate it so as to distinguish good from bad ; but more, it behooves him to know the weak points in human nature. Nothing so advantageous for him as to gain prevalence for a new fashion of very bad taste ; and the more grossly bad the surer and greater his benefit ; because the easier will be the task to bring about another change ; for of all things change is most beneficial to him. -The upholsterer\\'s interest then is in direct opposition to the architect\\'s credit. Put him into command in a room, and his first purpose must be to overwhelm the architect\\'s work. What are elegancies in stucco, stone, or marble to him? For daylight indeed he is a little dependent; he must have windows from the architect; and till stoves were brought into use he wanted him also for the chimney. But for candlelight, \"Give me a barn,\" he says, \"and I will so throw my many-folded drapery, suspended on my golden thyrsus-fashioned poles, that nothing shall be seen needing the architect\\'s art to supply.\" -To proceed with this subject, I will venture only to state a principle or two, which I trust you will admit, and I hope you will recommend to the ladies. When a -house is ready for the furnisherif it has any decoration of architecture fit to be seen, and not rather \\'deserving to be treated as the upholsterer, would\\' very properly treat the barn, the style of that decoration should be respected in the design of the furniture. Either all should be upholstery, or the upholstery should be subordinate to the architecture, and harmonize with it. Can it be requisite — I fear it may — to superadd, that the furniture should harmonize with itself through all its parts; that gaudy and ill assorted colors, awkward forms, and even elegant forms and foldings, in that kind of display which may deserve the epithet meretricious, however warranted by thefashion of the day, should be avoided. With what ideas do that nakedness of the female figure, and that abundant complexity, that mystery of folding, of the drapery about the room to receive such figures, as we have been accustomed to see, harmonize ? Fashion indeed is powerful, and sometimes grossly perverse. What could be reasonably done with the human head during the century and more of the successive fashions of the full bottomed wig, the aile-de-pigeon hair-dressing, and all that intervened and followed, till wigs and elaborate hair-dressing were both abolished ? Fashion, it must be confessed, has a strange power of fascination, which even strong minds have difficulty wholly to resist, even when that power is exerted most in opposition to evident reason. But it is only when a fashion has obtained universal and lasting prevalence that rea-son is so compelled to submit to it. Generally large choice is open. Reason and better taste may well venture upon opposition to partial and ephemeral absurdities, and, with due exertion, would prevent their gaining any overbearing ascendency. -The present rage for old articles of household use, table decoration, and personal adornment is a whim of fashion, in many instances the coveted articles having no element of propriety in our modern life. Very few of them are valuable in the light of sentiment, having no association with beloved friends or with historical events. -But apart f r om these considerations the love for genuine old relics of furniture, especially, has an excellent reason for its being. There are really valuable and useful articles of household economy which unreasoning style has relegated to the second-hand furniture store, to the attic, or to the barn, or perhaps ruthlessly destroyed, and which have been replaced by modern articles far inferior. The present spring seat sofa with its tufted cushions and tortoise back seat is not half so inviting and restful\\' as the old-fashioned, flat seated, broad sofa, long enough to receive a six-footer, and broad enough to hold him safely if sleep overtook him. Many of these articles are of solid w r ood with no suspicion of veneering, and their forms are really more elegant than those of to-day. Modern veneered and upholstered furniture requires repairing every few -years, or is worn beyond revamping within the recollection of a ten year old child. It is a source of regret that with the rage for antique furniture there is not also a demand for old time honesty in workmanship. In spite of the sneer against the old style straight backed chairs, most of the old style furniture was made for convenience. There never was a more convenient article of furniture than the old desk and drawers comA win e Cabinet bined — drawers below a folded-back desk, the back being pigeon holed, and the desk on hinges to be let down to form a writing shelf, and projecting far enough forward to give room for the writer\\'s knees. The cupboard was another useful article for the kitchen or dining room. It contained two or more wide drawers, with doors above them opening on shelves and racks, the whole standing on legs high enough to admit of sweeping under the cupboard. Memory recalls one, the framing and ends being of white walnut or hickory and the door panels and drawer fronts of cherry, both native woods, the creamy white of the hickory contrasting finely with the warm wine red of the cherry. These colors were set off by pendent pulls and door key escutcheon of polished ungilded brass that could be repolished and kept from the dilapidated appearance of -the warm gilded brass of the present. Such an article of furniture would give an air of substantial comfort to any modern home. -The inferiority of modern made furniture cannot properly be attributed to machine duplicated work ; it is as possible to make first class work by duplicating by machinery as by hand ; else our hand tools and machine tools would be much more costly than they are. But it is undeniable that most of the furniture made within the memory of the elderly portion of the present generation compares favorably with that now made, in durability and integrity of workmanship. In these qualities it would be well if our manufacturers shared in the rage for the antique. -Mediaeval furniture — Mobilia, as it is rightly styled — is one of the rarest manifestations of art-work or handicraft. Our knowledge of it is principally from pictures, illustrated MSS. and carvings. Contrary to the received opinion of some of the acknowledged authorities on Mediaeval art, we are convinced that there would be no difficulty in producing a very complete history of mobilia, the material for which could be drawn from the sources indicated. We see many modern specimens of both a bad and vitiated class of works, made at a time when splendid decoration reigned in place of art, and indeed no such thing as art existed. From this period we moderns have borrowed almost all our models, it being precisely the most unhappy choice we -could have made, not only on account of the amount of useless, expensive, and vulgar decoration it has led us into, but because the mere system of construction adopted is false, and so far, happily, insuring no lasting durability to the products of such workmanship. The furniture of every country has echoed in its form and decoration the character and spirit of the art then prevailing. In Egypt, of old, the tables, seats, couches, etc., preserved in the British Museum and other collections, testify to this; one or two things copied in bronze or marble from Greek works of this class, express exactly the same kind of thing, and point out by the extreme chastity of their forms, the peculiar idiosyncrasy of that nation, no less than by the skillful manner in which they are put together, the mechanical ability of the workman. Our knowledge of Roman doings in this matter is derived from similar sources. One or two examples of curule chairs that might have belonged to Pro-Consuls of Gaul or elsewhere, do indeed remain, with strange legends attached to them, and saints and monarchs of very questionable verity or appropriateness. Upon Pompeian pictures, bronzes, etc., we must rely, without which we should be more ignorant of these things than of the seemingly much more perishable and fragile manufactures in glass and earthenware, or even iron, of which such innumerable specimens exist. We have as many remains of Assyria as of old Rome. There is no doubt from the gorgeous illuminations of the -period of the lower Empire, that the furniture then in use was, characteristically wrought, of extraordinary splendour, gilded, incrusted, and inlaid with ivory and jewels to a degree that quite marred its artistic beauty. Of this, much purified by Italian taste, some slight -traces are to be found in the Venetian works, affected as they were in this, as in other things, by oriental neighborhood and associations. The Venetians improved these works, be it understood, and chastened, while they truly enriched the tawdry over decoration of the Greeks.. Their conquest in the islands and commercial seats in so many parts of the Byzantine Empire, brought them in contact with more than one point of its character. Of constructional felicity there is almost none in Byzantine examples of which we have knowledge. -In Europe, in the middle ages, the character of mobilia was ever that of current architecture, then the art to which all the other major as well as minor arts were subordinated, — that fact of their subordination being one to be ever most needfully borne in mind by the student of archaeological science and mediaeval art. We find this leading fact constantly forgotten by writers on the arts. To furniture particularly, painting became serviceable, the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries never missing an opportunity of employing that art in this way. Hence, several painters began life as decorators, as many more were sculptors who began as goldsmiths. Marquetry was another most effective means of decoration, becoming estimable from an early period of these epochs by the careful method of its execution, and, later, from the fine forms and colors its patterns displayed. In the sixteenth century much beautiful work was produced, its early decades being, indeed, to be regarded as the culminating period in furniture designing. Colors due to the above means, or rich velvets and silks, brocaded or woven with gold thread, took precedence in characteristic ornamentation at a somewhat late portion of this era. But carving, as so many French and German works testify, was largely employed. Both these characters ran into ruinous riot in the next epoch, and lavish magnificence took the place of beautiful design, the use of things themselves becoming hidden under a desire to waste all the -costliness and folly of extravagant ornamentation upon them. At this time began the still existing mania for furniture made for show ; and to be shut up in a room, wastefully decorated with merely costly ornaments, intended to be seen only, and but sparingly brought into use. It was the \"bright poker\" idea at its maddest. Hence we now find reception rooms that were too fine for use, and frail furniture neither man nor woman dared to intrust their persons upon. More sumptuosity and ridiculous degradation of taste burst out under Louis XIV., when those preposterously tawdry gewgaws that are to be seen here and there in sale rooms, when some old household is broken up, overloaded with tortoise shell, brass, sham jewelry, and vile carvings, and generally made to imitate something that had not the remotest resemblance to the real nature of article in question, but preferably that farthest from it. Thus a cabinet or \"armoire\" faced the world with an extravagant architectural frontage, and a chest of drawers was a miniature frontage. As was to be expected from the political state of the time, the most hideous of these monFigure 58 strosities came, not from -France, where the taste for these originated, but from servile Germany, whose craftsmen vied with each other in the cities of Nuremburg, Augsburg, and Dres-den, as to who should make the most monstrous foolery at the most wasteful cost. Italy, as usual, before her utter degradation kept to the fashions of an earlier date or improved by her native gift of taste, upon that current in such a manner that something of her old inheritance is seen even at this time. -Later in the seventeenth century especially, this whimsicality took a new bent, and a queer hothouse sort of life, a meretricious vitality, such as disease often has, broke out, and the Louis XV. fashion got into vogue, when oddly shaped forms, mouldings and inlays were employed, and flat surfaces bore the works of men\\'s lives — not of their minds, but of their patient dull drudgery at outre and elaborate combinations of art — necessarily, therefore, devoid of real taste and common sense. Incrustations of brass, copper, tin, and even silver were engraved by the burin to imitate relief or actual mouldings. Wreaths, termed masks — not the pretty Amorini of an earlier age — were attached to the articles, their office being almost invariably to hide some dishonesty of construction or to give a curve to some weak angle or strengthen some spindling line, to the eye at least, but not in fact. Indeed it is notably a marked characteristic of this class of works that all their tendencies are to be willfully false. One sees at once that the craftsman does not err in ignorance of the demands of his duty because things which might, constructionallv employed, give real strength when needed, although of -a supplementary sort, willfully give only the look of strength, and, as if by malicious intention to lie for lying\\'s sake, neglect their duty when it \\\\yere easier to do it honestly than to fail or neglect. Thus it is in the major art of that time; thus it was in life, among the leaders, at least; thus it was upon everything that lies upon the surface of that rotten era, that nothing but the fiery ruin of revolution could purge pure. -Mere costliness is no element of art or good taste. We have seen very handsome chairs sold at a price that would condemn them in the eyes of untrained wealth, just as we have seen on the tea-table of the poor and lowly, low cost china that would put to blush — if it was possible — much of the high priced porcelain that decorates the cabinets of the wealthy. -The perfecting of many processes of manufacture has placed at the disposal of artists and ornamental designers means for the reproduction and multiplication of their works, of which they have not been slow to avail themselves. As a class they undoubtedly occupy more definitely the position of leaders or teachers ; and we are fairly entitled to hope that by this teaching the standard of public taste has been raised. The soil to be cultivated is rank with weeds, and the intelligent laborers are few. Our manufactures are in advance of our taste. The conditions of art and manufacture in the Middle Ages are in our day reversed : then there was a Raphael to design, but no Minton to reproduce skillfully -and at a cheap rate the pattern example ; now we have the power of cheap reproduction, but not many designs worth reproducing; so we wisely store our museums with all the best examples of human invention, and thus provide ourselves at once with a standard, and with a check upon any vain ideas we may be disposed to entertain of our intellectual superiority and advanced taste. -Never in the world\\'s history were the means of spreading a taste for art among the people as abundant. The productions of our manufacturers are placed before us with cheapness and certainty, and where bad taste in designs is to be noted, the fault can hardly be laid at the door of the producer, who, in many cases failing to secure the services of an original or even capable designer, is driven to pander to a taste which he would willingly enough direct if he could. We have so-called schools of design, instituted expressly to provide our manufacturers with intelligent designers; and we are able, by means of lithographic printing and photo engraving, to distribute cheaply and make common property throughout the length and breadth of the land the finest examples of all good art, in whatever form it may have appeared. Yet, after all, in the comprehension of good design, in appreciation of beautiful form, in sentiment of color, we are but a barbarous people as compared with any Eastern nation, or with our own Gothic ancestors. The best that can be said of us is -that we feel our inferiority when we look at an Indian shawl, at a Moorish pitcher, a Persian rug, or a Chinese vase. We try unsuccessfully to reproduce them ; we do actually reproduce the ceramic ware of the 16th century, and glory in it; while we vainly strive to copy the mediaeval stained-glass windows, and are driven to confess that a people who flourished before the foundation of Rome were capable of designing a gold setting for a brooch which puts all our barbarous efforts to shame. -The spread of art is one thing; the advance is another. With our eyes open, it would be vain to deny that throughout the kingdom a new taste has arisen, and a desire among all classes of the people to appropriate some form of art is evident. But taste implies only accuracy of judgment, not that power of execution which follows in its wake. The taste of the man who knows is not that of the man who does. -The first-named may be considered as a bon vivant, who is fond of the dishes before him, and distinguishes nicely what is savoury and delicious, or flat and insipid in the ingredients of each ; while the second may be regarded as the cook, who, from knowing what things will mix well together, and distinguishing by a nice taste, when he has arrived at that happy result, is able to compose such exquisite mixtures. -In the construction and ornamentation of furniture, as of buildings, grounds, clothing, and of everything\" -else of a material character, external to ourselves, several things are to be considered in their relation to our needs, comfort, and enjoyment. The mere necessaries of life are really very few, though even these may be multiplied by habit, education, and circumstance. The man of thorough culture and high civilization certainly needs many things which the savage can do without and which would be even an incumbrance to him. But if these, increased in number as they are by artificial circumstances, are fully supplied, we are not, and ought not to be, satisfied. We may and should consider what is adapted to promote our comfort and gratify our taste, ministering appropriately, in both directions, to our enjoyment. For our present purpose and in connection with cabinet and upholstery work, it will be sufficient to consider three things — Novelty, Taste and Utility. -i. Novelty. — This is always a source of pleasure, affording a healthful excitement to the mind. This is the reason of the frequently sudden and extreme changes in fashion, of the desire to visit localities and scenes which are new and strange to us, and of the effort to secure for the gratification of all the senses ever new means of pleasure and excitement. The conservative critic may find fault with this universal tendency to innovation, but it will excite and exert its influence so long as the human mind tires of sameness, and seeks for change. We desire repose and permanency of con-ditions and surroundings only when we have ceased to acquire and develop, and our powers have begun to decline with the coming on of old age. This quality of novelty is one which all who would cater for the popular taste and, by so doing, secure and maintain a successful business, must aim at in connection with other qualities of excellence. It is also unquestionably true that the desire and effort for novelty leads sometimes to the adoption of styles and ornaments which are unsymmetrical and incongruous, and though striking and sometimes even almost pleasing to those who crave that which is startling and outre, they will greatly offend good taste. There are certain established principles which are the basis of all correct procedure, and any rule of mechanical practice, or even what has come to be an established custom may be departed from or neglected, so that there is no infringement of these fixed principles, among which may be named fitness, utility, propriety. If, in seeking novelty, the artist-mechanic introduces that which is in violation of the principles of unity and harmony, he will forfeit his claim to be called in any sense an artist. Let him rather search for the union of novelty with other beauties, with a constant consideration of a reference to fundamental principles., and to this end it will be well that he should thoroughly study the details of the works of ancient art, whether of the Gothic and other mediaeval styles, or of the more remote classical. From these may be gathered -suggestions which, by exact reproduction or suitable combination, will afford designs, which may be applied to modern uses with excellent effect for internal finishing and furniture. -2. We consider, in the next place, the element of Taste in construction and ornamentation. It has been well said that \"art can lend to an object a value, greater than that of the material and workmanship of which it consists, even when the object is formed of precious materials, as of rare marbles, scarce woods, or \\'silver or gold/ \\' And, where the material is of less intrinsic value, yet more will depend on art and the taste displayed in figure and ornament. The beautiful, the tasteful has a commercial value — a remark as true of the goods named in the opening sentence of this article, as of those in any line of manufacture. It follows, then, that the manufacturer, who can in the highest degree secure that the productions of his establishment shall be in the greatest degree tasteful, and worthy to be styled beautiful, will in this fact secure no mean advantage in the busy arena of competition. Expenditure in the employment of designers who shall be true artists, even though it may seem hardly necessary or profitable, may prove to be really wise in principle, and most satisfactory in results. The workman also may, with great benefit to himself, study these works thus greatly enhancing the value of his labor, and become more than a mechanic, for he that can, in a novel form or one that -is original with himself, form a chair or a table, which, either as a whole or in its details, is really tasteful — \"a thing of beauty\" — is truly an artist. If he has the laudable ambition in this manner to rise above his fellows, let him acquaint himself with the laws of beauty, so that he shall be able at once to see the difference, and the reason of it, between the beautiful and the ugly, the graceful and the deformed, the refined and the coarse. Let him study the works of art of all ages, in the great variety of subjects to which art has been applied, and he will not only have opened to him new and most fruitful sources of pleasures, but will add, to mere skill in the use of tools, the development of a talent that shall command its price. -3. The other point which we proposed to consider was — Utility. This may appear to be independent in some measure of the considerations before named, yet a manifest adaptation to the purpose for which it is designed will be an element in the decision of the question whether it is tasteful or not. Such is the constitution of the human mind that what might, aside from any consideration of its use, seem to be without form or comeliness, assumes a certain appearance of beauty, when it seems to be precisely fitted to the convenience of the user. It is also clear that the purpose for which an object is intended should be met in its structure and form, and no adjunct, for the sake merely of decoration, should be permitted to interfere with its utility, or be -inconsistent with the position which it occupies in relation to the whole subject or article. The material should be studied with its adaptability to those forms -which are essential to the use of the article which is to be manufactured. It should not be assumed that, because certain forms and decorations may be appropriate to one material, they would be equally adapted to, and look equally well in, another material entirely different in its character. One of the essentials of a good design -in industrial art is the adaptation of the natural characteristics of the materials in which the design is to be realized. The form, also, must in every case subserve the purpose for which the article is to be made, the lines being as graceful and as true in the relative proportions of the parts as will be consistent with the convenience of the person who may use the article. When, however, the objection is made to a chair or to a lounge that one cannot sit or rest easily and comfortably upon it, it is not a sufficient answer that the form of the one is graceful and all its lines those of beauty, and that the other is tasteful in design, and that in material and covering there is harmony both of proportions and of colors. They are articles not to be looked at — not that merely or chiefly — but to be used, and in their very form should be suggestive of rest, refreshment, repose. Other illustrations might be given of this point ; these, however, will suffice to illustrate the position that, whenever utility is sacrificed to novelty or to ornamental appearance, however pretty, the article is badly designed, and the art or skill exercised upon it has been practically thrown away. -Words are more or less indefinite in their meaning, and admit of wider and more comprehensive translation, according to their context with other words, or their association with ideas previously existing in the minds of their hearers. Among them all, there are perhaps none more difficult to explain than the word style, -by Webster, we shall find how large is its range, how wide its divergence from any center that can be marked out for it. Walker puts among other things as its signification \"manner of writing,\" with regard to language; manner of speaking, appropriate to particular character ; title, appellation. All this may be right ; at any rate is enough for him who is not required to go into lengthy definitions, but merely to throw out such suggestions as will, when united with others, be the seed of future comprehension. -I think we may acknowledge style to be the instrument of power by which we convey emphasis of expression in our work, and render intelligible forms which would otherwise be both meaningless and purposeless. There is another word which artists are in the habit of associating, and even confusing with style, Manner, which when repeated again and again is designated as mannerism, a feature by which we are too often enabled to distinguish the productions of one man, and even of one age, from those of another; but there is a wide difference between it and style. Style advances whatever it is attached to, makes its intentions more evident, increases the force of its expression, as well as frees it from impurities which in no way help the object it has in view ; while manner, or mannerism, on the contrary, serves no good purpose, is, in fact, most frequently merely the mirror in which the artist, or may be the period at which he lived, is unconsciously reflected. -That style and manner are frequently so mingled one with another as to render it difficult to separate them, or to distinguish which is which, I will confess; but the simple text I have here put to you will, I think, if carefully attended to, though perhaps not serving as an exact definition, show what is style and what is not, and even tell in what proportion mannerism, if any, is introduced. -This question the student will do well to constantly consider, as it tends to elevate what he may send forth, and keep it free from much that is detrimental to excellence, though at the same time highly seductive to the young mind. I wish to be the more impressive in this advice, because I cannot help fancying that at this moment there is a more than usual quantity of mannerism passing for style in the world of Art, and that students are mistaking one for the other, and running after the wrong thing, by affecting peculiarities and imitating weaknesses belonging to past ages, and quite out of place in the present day. I am not saying this in any invidious spirit; on the contrary, I am ready to acknowledge that many fine works are put forth among us, that carry out with powerful emphasis the spirit that is within them, simply because the treatment of every part is in unison with that spirit, and serves to elucidate the meaning intended by the sculptor ; but the weed of mannerism is growing at the same time among us — mannerism, I fancy, not derived even from the best -Style is the gold that is the mark of genius, and mannerism the color by which you distinguish from whence it comes. All that relates to style is derived from the most profound knowledge. -With some style implies simple excellence of treatment in contradiction to the absence of that quality, and they read it as a mannerism always the same, and equally applicable to the carrying out in Art of all subjects — they talk of a Classical style and think this is the only adjunct that can properly be attached to it. There are other meanings to the word than this, or rather its meaning is capable of great extension. There is the Severe style, perhaps pretty much, though not quite the same thing as the Classical; then there is the Gothic style, which, clinging to a certain extent to the Classical, has its own peculiar mode of expression. Then, again, the simple and the Florid styles, which, it is not too much to say, are directly opposed to each other; and the Domestic style, which contradicts and entirely sets at defiance the Classical ; and we might even add to them the Grotesque style, which hardly claims relationship with any of them. We will endeavour to explain the difference between them and the requirements of each. -The classical style would be the line we should adopt in our work when the subject to be treated belongs to -the classical days of old — when it associates itself with the grand old bards whose distant footsteps echo through the corridors of time, or whose conceptions are of that lofty nature that they admit of no minute detail, or dwelling on petty things. Our illustrations of them should then be in the same style, severe and simple, not -like everyday Nature, but like a something which we all of us, more or less, endeavour to conceive, and even long to be about us; but which can only exist ideally within ourselves, more or less clear, according as we are capable of entering into the feeling of the poet, or of becoming part of it ourselves. -The error modern imitators of Greek Art generally commit is exaggerating the tendency to straight lines and the repetition of them. -The Gothic style, as we have said before, retains some connection with the Classic by preserving its quiet -simplicity as well as its grace of line. That it has much of mannerism cannot be denied, arising, often from the mistake of the workers in it, who have fancied that rudeness and exaggeration of form necessarily belonged to it. This peculiarity, however, appertains only to the more decayed periods, and not to the time when it rose into beauty and fine art, as in the 13th century. That it had then and has now a style of its own is certain, for it had to express and does express the tone and feeling of a religion quite distinct from that of the Greeks — less earthly or sensuous, more pure and ethereal, more divine. We are now speaking, of course, of monumental and religious Art, the only things in which the Gothic is appropriate. In a domestic or homely sphere it always appears to be out of place and unsuited to the purpose. -The Gothics were greater architects than the Greeks, in a way, but it would be idle to assert that they were as good sculptors; there is no reason, however, why the finest works should not be combined with the Gothic style, for they can be made quite compatible with it. -Even the Florid style, which, from our dislike to it as somewhat debasing Art, we feel much inclined to stigmatize with the title of mannerism, is sometimes admissible ; in fact, must be acknowledge to be, under some circumstances, the most appropriate — for instance in the decoration of the theatre, the ball-room, and other places of amusement. Surely when so placed it is -more in unison than any other with that elevation of the spirits which is supposed to pervade the scene. -The severe, unaffected Classical style would be a damper on our enjoyment under such circumstances, when we are not looking coldly on at real life, but taking, so to speak, a glance at it through a colored glass or our imagination. -Shakespeare, in his poetic drama of \"The Tempest,\" seems to give us a view of it in this florid style. He elevates by his poetical imagination the scenes he portrays, and so leads us away into a realm of ideality more florid, more enjoyable than the reality we are compelled every day to take part in. You must do the same with your art, or at any rate furnish your portion in that enjoyment, and you will do it best by bending it to the same feeling. -It is under such influences that high and ornamental sculpture most frequently join hands together, and are present, not as real personages, or as representatives of particular ideas, but as decorations of a scene created for the transient pleasure of the moment. Your lines may now flow with greater freedom, your figures perform their parts with less reserve than on other occasions, your style may in short be florid. It is here, if anywhere, that color may be introduced into your statues, as well as into the ornaments about them. The danger is of their becoming sensuous; but the refinement, whether of design or execution, which you will -introduce, will keep that down in the same way as the great dramatist has done in the fairy tale I have just alluded to. There are scenes and characters in that which connect it with the lower features of humanity, and so preserve a relationship to the real, which no imaginative work, whether of Art or Literature, should be entirely without ; whilst there are others, the creation of poetic fancy, which serve to lift us upwards into the realms of ideality; and make us the better for the enjoyment we receive. You will say we are soaring into the region of rhodomontade and losing the practical; but we may tell you that you need not feel yourself so strictly bound by rule in this style as in the others ; your forms are not required to be so true to the modesty of Nature as they are generally ; they may be made more elective by a departure from truth, or at any rate an exaggeration of fact. With those proportions which Nature has given to different objects of her creation you may deal freely, altering them to suit your own ; _ k rposes of expression or effect. We will put before you Cellini, as the highest example in this walk of Art. Strictly speaking he is an ornamentalist ; but he sometimes attempts high Art, where there is often with him a lack of correct proportion — for instance, in his statue of Perseus, where the over ornamentation hardly hides from a practical eye the want of proper balance of parts. Sometimes, indeed, in his metal works he uses his freedom as a license which serves the stvle to which his -work belongs, and so answers the purpose he has in view ; he is rarely, if ever, quite natural, though always florid in his style, and always effective. -It will be impossible in a work of this kind, to write at length on the various styles, so we will content ourselves with touching on some of those styles which seem to have been much in favor at certain periods. To go into this matter extensively would require several volumes of greater dimensions than the present one. -As with all the arts, crafts and sciences, we get all our glimmerings from, or through the Egyptians, so everything pertaining to the earliest examples of furniture come to us from that source. -Many people imagine that the habit of sitting down, as practiced in this country and Europe, is a universal human habit, old as the race itself, and in no way associated with civilization. Investigations, however, have shown that the habit is acquired, and marks the highest notch of civilization and advancement ; indeed, it is estimated that not more than 10 per cent of the human family practice sitting on the civilized plan. -Men who do not sit have two attitudes for resting; women use one of their own. Squatting on the heel is favored in India and China. In this position the weight of the body falls upon the toes, and to keep the balance comfortably the arms must hang over the knees, the hands dangling. The cross-legged attitude is general from Siam eastward, through the Malay countries. In -the jungle men crouch, the knees raised, the arms folded over them and the chin resting on the arm. The women -of that region rest upon the floor sideways, thus throwing the weight on the outer part of one thigh, not a very comfortable posture to a civilized Caucasian., -As civilization advanced in Egypt the use of furniture became more and more necessary. First the rulers began with thrones and seats of honor for the kings and nobles; then the rich merchants followed, providing themselves with furniture less costly, perhaps, but equally as useful as that owned and used by State officials. The working classes and the poor were doubtless content to sit down on their mats of papyri stalks, under the shelter of their rough cabins of mud. The rich of the dynasties, dating from the twelfth to the thirtieth, furnished their houses with very costly furniture, which consisted principally of rich beds, or couches with their beds, or mattresses, pillows and cushions, and wooden head-rests, footstool stands, tables and chairs, both with high and low back; or folding stools, like the Greek okladias, boxes or chests for holding clothes and other objects. From the earliest period high-backed and other chairs were in use, and at the time of the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties were imported as tribute from Ethiopia. Pillows of stone, wood and other objects were also of great antiquity, and are represented in coffins of the sixth and following dynasties. They exhibit a great variety of shape, consisting of a curved semi-elliptical portion, adapted to hold the back of the head, supported by a column or other contrivance resting on a base or pedestal. For furniture, various woods were employed — ebony, acacia or soft cedar, sycamore and others of species not determined; ivory, both of -the hippopotamus and the elephant, and used for inlaying, as also were glass pastes, and specimens of marquetry are not uncommon. In the paintings in the tombs gorgeous pieces of gilded furniture are depicted. For cushions and mattresses, linen cloth, feathers of water fowl and colored stuffs appear, to have been used, while seats have plaited bottoms of linen cord or tanned and dyed leather thrown over them. Sometimes the skins of panthers were used for the purpose. On the whole an Egyptian house was lightly furnished and not encumbered with so many articles as are in use at the present day. For carpets they used mats of plain fiber, on which children and servants sat, or rather squatted. -The chest shown at Fig. 58 seems to have been a very popular piece of furniture, as numbers are found depicted on the tombs and monuments. The bedstead and ivory headrest shown in Fig. 59 were also common articles of furniture with the rulers and with the rich, and many of them were finely upholstered with handsome and costly fabrics. -The fragments of a chair shown in Fig. 60 — are still in existence, and preserved in the British Museum, and show the remains of the veritable chair used as a throne by Queen Hatasu, a royal lady who made things lively for a while in the valley of the Nile some 1600 years before Christ and twenty-nine years before Moses. This is, so far as we know, the most venerable piece of wooden furniture in the world. There is in the Louvre, -France, a metal chair, decorated and incrusted with mosaics, that is older by 400 years than the one exhibited. Hatasu\\'s chair or throne, or rather what remains of it — as it is in a dilapidated condition and has to be secured with brass bands — is made of what appears to be lignum-vitse, is of a dark color, like cocus wood, and is inlaid over all the carved portions with gold plates. The two sacred serpents, shown on the two uprights at the back, however, are not treated so, but, as the detail illustrates, with little silver rings sunk all over them ; probably a conventional rendering of the snake skin. -The five articles of furniture exhibited in the group, Fig. 61, showing a stool, stand for a vase, workman\\'s stool, head-rest and vase on a stand, are from photos of the originals in the British Museum. They are Egyptian examples and are more than 3000 years old. Nothing can be more suitable for its purpose than the \"workman\\'s stool.\" The seat is precisely like that of a modern kitchen chair (all wood), slightly concaved to promote the sitter\\'s comfort, and supported by three legs curving outwards. This is simple, convenient and admirably adapted to long service. Besides these examples, there are jn the museum several seats formed with cross legs on the principle of our common campstool, and all are well made and have the lower parts of their legs carved as heads of geese, with inlayings of -There are in the various museums many articles of luxury and comfort taken from Egyptian tombs, which demonstrate the extraordinary state of civilization and culture attained by these ancient people, that aid us in forming a picture of their domestic habits. Boxes, chests, tables and shelves in great variety have been unearthed, \"some inlaid with various woods and with little squares of bright turquoise blue pottery let in as a relief; others veneered with ivory; wooden spoons carved in most intricate designs, of which one, representing a girl among lotus flowers, is a work of great artistic skill; boats of wood, head-rests and carved models of parts of houses and granaries, together with writing materials, different kinds of tools and implements and quantities of personal ornaments and requisites.\" -Indeed the more we know of the Egyptians the more w r e are led to believe that long before Greece or Rome were known they enjoyed a remarkably high state of civilization and learning, with all their accompanying advantages. -A figure given (in group) exhibit two very old chairs and a couple of Egyptian chairmakers at work, with some of the tools and materials scattered about on the floor. Here we see a square, a couple of adzes, and a drill in the hands of one of the workmen, who is bor-ing a hole in the chair by using a bow to turn the drill. These tools are very much like the tools in use today. Several finished chair legs are seen on the wall. This carving on the walls of a tomb, was executed between two and three thousand years ago. -Furniture used by the Chaldeans, the Assyrians, Babylonians, Hebrews and other old nations, was of similar type to the Egyptian, as may be seen by referring to a number of illustrations shown, also examples of Greek and Roman furniture are given. -Some of the chairs shown are fine examples, and both are constructed on Egyptian and other lines. Later styles, or rather examples of later styles, are shown in Figs. 19, 20, the coronation chair, 28, and others shown in the first chapter. -The Gothic style in furniture began during the reign of Louis VIII, and St. Louis (Louis IX) — 1223-1270; the style growing out of the Byzantine style of Architecture, and was introduced by the artists and craftsmen brought to France from Constantinople by the returning crusaders. -The thirteenth and fourteenth centuries had been remarkable for a general development of commerce ; merchants had traded extensively with the East, and had grown opulent, and their homes naturally displayed signs of wealth and comfort that in former times had been impossible to any but princes and rich nobles. -quarters a taste for high and rich colorings and we have the testimony of an old writer who describes the interior of the Hotel de Beheme, which, after being the residence of several great personages, was given by Charles VI. in 1388 to his brother the Duke of Orleans. \"In this palace was a room used by the Duke, hung with cloth of gold, embroidered with windmills. There were besides rich carpets with gold flowers, cushions of cloth of gold, and summer carpets of Arragon leather.\" -As we approach the end of the fourteenth century we find canopies added to the \"chairs,\" which were carved in oak and chestnut and sometimes elaborately gilded and picked out in color. The canopied seats were bulky and throne-like constructions, and were abandoned toward the end of the fifteenth century, for a somewhat smaller and less massive seat. -The high-backed chair shown in Fig. 62 is a sample of this style. Chairs, tables, beds and fittings were all made in this style and the interiors were rich in carvings, massive but stiff and informal. Plate I, exhibits a chamber in this style of the period of Louis XI, which shows a bed and several pieces of furniture. Fig. 63 shows a German chamber of a somewhat later date. The French carved bed with canopy, Fig. 64, is of the period of Louis XIV. It is an example that was much followed, and the fashion lasted well into the period of Louis the XVI. A gradual change in French furniture took place during the reign of Louis XVI, and the orna-mentation assumed the style as shown in Plate II. French furniture was continually changing in style, and we have early and late French, Louis Seize, and Empire styles, each of these having their changes, imitations and modifications. -Gilt wood, Chinese lacquers and their imitations by means of the varnish to which Robert Martin gave his name, are the preferred materials. Bronze mountings, set in the panels, and cut out in highly elaborate patterns, decorate the cabinets of Cafneri. The marquetry work of Boulle, made to conform with the prevailing style is continued by the heirs of the celebrated workman. -The ornamentation that is peculiar to the style of Louis XV. modifies the old elements and introduces new ones. A narrow but very much lengthened acanthus takes the place of the rich and broad acanthus of the Louis XIV. -This new form becomes associated with shells, rocaille, perforated stones. The development of the natural science, interest in which is manifested by the gathering of collections of shells, etc., has a share, together with the popularity of Dresden China, in bringing about the triumph of the style rocaille. -An interior of the style Louis XV. also includes the decorative Chinese fancies, the carved elephants of Caffieri\\'s clocks; \\'then the characters of Italian comedy, reminiscences of Watteau, and the little love sports met -with pretty much everywhere, in Tapestry, ceramic jewelry, snuff-boxes, bon-bonnieres, fans, transom panels, screens, and the many quaint and curious fancies peculiar to that era. -The cabinets, Figs. 65 and 66, and carved walnut bed, Fig. 67, of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are good examples of the work of those periods and offer many suggestions to designers, carvers and workmen. The bed shown in Fig. 68, was used by Pope Pius VII, at Fontainbleau, and is rich in decoration and costly drapery. -Plate III shows a whole series of details in Louis Seize style, from which the cabinet-maker may garner -many good things for nearly all purposes. Fig. 69 shows a cabinet in this style which is elaborately finished and decorated with gold. It is a thing of beauty -and was purchased for the museum at a cost of $7,500. The table shown at Fig. 70 is a fine specimen of the style Louis Seize and is beautifully carved. Fig. 71 shows a good old-fashioned commode ornamented lavishly with gilt, bronze and inlay ; the Louis Seize chairs illustrated in Fig. 72 are good examples of the period. They are finished in blue and gold and are very dainty pieces of furniture. These illustrations are drawn from photos of the originals now in the Cluny museum. A most beautiful piece of work is a little ebony cabinet, Fig. J2> — now m tne Kensington museum, which was made by the celebrated French cabinet-maker, Boulle. It is beautifully inlaid in the most exquisite designs and made nearly two hundred years ago. -Boulle, not to mention many others of the earlier period, was an artist ; he conceived his own designs, he drew them out (the patent is given him in his name not only as a cabinet-maker, but as an architect and sculptor), he executed everything with his own hands; he was a chaser, engraver, and gilder ; he was, as we see, a man of cultivated tastes into the bargain.\" When we add to his merit as a designer, and a delicate appreciator of the work of others, his merit as a good workman whose productions, without need of repair, are as stout in the present day, after two hundred years of use as they were the day they were made, it may be fairly conceded, even by the sternest rigorist, that Andre Boulle worked in what is understood as\\' the true spirit. Not -only in its construction, but in every feature, in the choice of the materials, in the chasing and gilding and the marquetry, his work will be found to be of the most honest kind, very different to the modern rubbish that passes under the name, where false tortoise shell, made of horn or gelatine ; false mother-of-pearl, box or horn instead of ivory ; brass or even zinc lacquered ornament tacked on to the ill-made joinery usurp the place of true work, whose only fault was that it was produced in a period when the traditions of art were on the decline. When Boulle used wood it was ebony, which the cabinet makers, his successors, on the plea of its difficulty in working, in taking the glue or varnish — Boulle never used varnish — and other reasons, replaced with stained pear-wood. In the choice of his woods Boulle showed the extremest care, and one of his severest blows was his loss, by the fire that destroyed his collection of prints, of a qauntity of rare woods which he had, we learn from the inventory he made at the time, long stored by to season. The bronze he used was honestly chiselled and chased and gilt, not lacquered, and each ornament was a design not stamped out. -The secrets of Boulle\\'s skill may be said to have died with their inventor, for though the traditions were continued, the sobriety and the grandiose style of the master will be found to be sadly wanting in all the work of his imitators. So much was this recognized that, throughout the last century, in all the sale catalogues the works -by Boulle himself are conspicuously marked, more than one collector made it his specialty to gather specimens of the great cabinet maker\\'s work. -Boulle died at the age of eighty-two (February 29, 1732) at his house in the Louvre, and was buried in the -neighboring church of Saint Germain L\\'Auxerrois, leaving two sons to combine, only in name it is true, the traditions which he had in a measure positively created. One of the sons, employed at the Sevres manufactory, was, it would appear, the first to introduce, in the decoration of furniture, the use of porcelain. -Plate IV shows a couple of tables of the style of Louis XVI, which contain a number of very useful suggestions, suggestions that will be utilized in the manu-During the Marie Antoinette period, the most extravagant furniture was made and the most extravagant -prices were paid for it, and some very handsome specimens were turned out. The little writing table shown in Fig. 74, was specially designed and made for the Queen, and cost a very large sum of money. This table is now in England and was bought some years ago for $37,000, an enormous amount of money for so small a piece of furniture. An English writer who was at the sale, in speaking of it, says : \"It amused me to notice -that it required a special attendant to guard this little specimen, so many were crowding round to inspect it. -It was literally mobbed as I tried to get a glimpse of it for my note book, and the adjectives showered upon 1; by the upper ten were the most expressive I have ever heard applied to furniture. It was oblong in shape, with a drawer fitted with inkstand, writing-slide, and shelf beneath an oval medallion of a trophy, and flowers on the top, and trophies with four medallions round the -sides. This was stamped J. Riesner, and branded underneath with cypher of Marie Antoinette and Garde Meuble de la Reine. This really beautiful article of fur-niture was exhibited in 1862 at the South Kensington Loan Exhibition. Three thousand guineas was the first bid for it, but it soon ran up to 4,500 guineas, at which price some dispute arose as to whose bid it was. This was settled by $25,000 being offered, and the bidding continued till the price reached $30,500, when, amid much applause, it became the property of Mr. Wer-theimer. I anticipated that this little gem would realize a large sum, but the amount obtained for it is certainly fabulous. I can say, however, that the beauty of the workmanship must be seen to be believed.\" -Fig. 75 illustrates a bed introduced by Queen Marie Antoinette. This bed became quite popular for a time, but ran out of vogue during the revolution after which the Empire Style was introduced, when beds were specially designed for warriors, judges, statesmen and successful leaders; many of the beds were heaps of silly ornament and cumberous and rich draperies. This phase of the Empire style did not last long, however, but gave place to a more sensible practice of construction and ornamentation. The two Plates, V and VI, show details and ornamentation in the better days of the Empire style. Plate V showing some of the best examples of the period. -The French revolution brought with it many good things — as well as bad, and it was really a blessing in disguise in many ways inasmuch as it cleared the way for better things among which may be mentioned the Empire style as represented in the illustrations and Plates shown herewith. -Among the many decorations in this style, quivers, torches, and armorial trophies were freely made use of, and this tendency to make ornament subservient to the general form, of which it should always be only the complement and accessory, so far from diminishing in -the next age, became accentuated, as the following illustrations of \"Empire\" will demonstrate. It had forced itself into fashion, and opened up fresh fields -and pastures new for the courageous decorator. Its promoters had gone to draw inspiration from the philosophical world of antiquity, and they studiously attempted to revive antique rules, traditions and customs, many of which were inconsistent with modern life. The broad-backed chair (Fig. 76) makes a fine looking, comfortable seat. Cleverly hollowed out to catch the back and support the shoulders, it proffers the acme of comfort, without, at the same time, being stuffy. -Passing to Fig. yy, we find a form of couch which was at one time very popular in this country. It reminds one of the old \"high-low\" designs which used to be the fashion in the \"early fifties,\" and there is no doubt that this choice of a resting pad proves a comfort to the sitter who is dainty in the matter of position. -This design, which is without a back, is evidently for use rather than display. Before passing from this design we cannot help noticing the increased opportunities which it gives to the chair or settee frame maker, as he has been too much in the habit of hiding his work with ostentatious upholstery. The small table (Fig. 78) is for decorative rather than useful purposes. The design, if well executed, adds unusual classic dignity to the center of a room, or as a choice corner-piece. This belongs to the class erstwhile known as the \"loo\" table, and has been in the background of late years. It is -still in vogue in its larger forms as a dining-table, and those who still possess one will enthusiastically tell you that for a small dinner party there is nothing compar-able with our circular friend. The outward bend and consequent placing of one\\'s neighbors right and left, in a position where conversation is enjoyable, renders the round table unrivalled for the party of six or eight. -There is a sturdiness about German furniture, that does not obtain in French or in the furniture of other Latin races, as may be seen in the examples shown on Plate VII, where five pieces of German Renaissance are illustrated. True, these pieces are not so dainty, or so exquisitely beautiful as much of the French work, yet, -they have a dignity of their own, and the carvings are stronger and more vigorous than those of French pro-duction. The Frontispiece of this work shows a very fine example of German work, and is quite modern, both in style and construction. -The German bed shown at Fig. 79 is quite a solid looking piece of furniture, but has an inviting and comfortable appearance. -The two old German chairs shown at Figs. 80 and 81, are comfortable even if they are heavily built and ponderous looking. They are substantial and strong. The little table, Fig. 82, is characteristic of old time German work. The bed shown in Fig. 83 is drawn from a photo taken of the bed used by Napoleon, and his consort, the unfortunate Josephine. It is said to be a very comfortable bed to rest in and there are many like it still used in France. -The sturdy old chair shown in Fig. 84, is from Spain. In form, the chair is of course, common enough; but a new idea may be gathered from the upholstery. It consists of stout velvet, stuffed properly with feathers, and quilted after down-quilt fashion. It is fastened to the walnut framing with \"extra size\" brass studs, and some neglige trellis fringe is added to finish. It seems to me that such quilted upholstery might be applied to many modern chairs where shallow stuffing is desirable. If hair is substituted for feathers, a comfortable and pleasing result could be obtained without the stuffiness and fragility of bottoming. Altogether this old chair looks commanding as the center-piece in the large glass case in which it is preserved. -We may now safetly turn to English, and American furniture, and its makers, of the eighteenth, and the latter part of the seventeenth centuries, which were the periods of the most artistic work. In the earliest work, the lingering of Gothic and early Renaissance principles of construction gave a respose of line and appearance of stability and permanence often lacking in French -furniture of the same time. French eighteenth-century furniture, though in reality very substantially built, is apt to have a fragile appearance, and every one knows that the grace and freedom of its curves are only to be had at the cost of a considerable loss of strength. In keeping to simpler and more rigid forms the English and American makers were preserving good traditions, and if their ornamental systems were seldom appropriate or in pure taste, at least good workmanship and careful finish cannot be denied them. -large bookcase, Fig. 85, as will be seen by the plan, is very simple in construction ; but what a hotch-potch the designer has made of Gothic-looking clustered columns, false pediment with olive mouldings, and classic -aeroteria. The other bookcase, Fig. 86, solid shelves alternating with closed cupboards, is again of sensible general design; but, though its proportions are much -better, there is a mixture of ornamental motives which strikes the eye as incongruous. The pretty rococo crestings, to which, if cast in brass or gilt, no one need object as a finish for the top of the piece, are still not in keeping with the severe geometrical tracery of the panels and sash lines. The two end cupboards especially are out of all harmony with the center form of the pediments. -The two night tables by Ince and Mayhew, Fig. 89, show, that to the right the pure French style; that to -the left the English taste in an uncommonly straightforward example. Nothing has here been borrowed of the French but its lightness and finish. The geometrical tracery is not put out of countenance by the very discreet introduction of rococo foliage scrolls at the feet and supporting the raised parts of the slight rail. One feels how much more comfortable an object it is than -its neighbor, which, though really as soundly built, has an air of being in full dress, and not to be familiarly treated. The supper Canterbury and stand by Sheraton -are likewise simple and of a sturdy elegance. It is in such pieces as these that we have the best work by the best workmen. A father and son, under the firm title of Win. Loyd & Son, Boston, Mass., made a lot of work of this kind before the revolution, and many pieces of this work found their way into Philadelphia and the south as far as Georgia ; and was quite common in the -New England States, New York, and New Jersey. Odd pieces are occasionally found in some of the old colonial houses. This work may be known by the two letters L and B, which are usually found burned in some out of the way place on the specimen. The letters were rudely cut in the brand. -Chippendale the greatest English designer and cabinet maker revolutionized the styles of furniture and introduced many new features that seemed to take hold -of the people and stay by them, and his contemporaries and immediate followers kept the public favor by designing on lines somewhat similar to those of the master. Along with the meritorious things Chippendale designed there came a lot of stuff that was frivolous and -almost absurd and showed how the artist must have been lost in the struggle after novelties. His imitators were as faulty in many of their productions, and Sheraton, Heppelwhite, Mayhew, Ince, and even the Adam brothers, left much work behind them that had but little merit. I do not wish it to be inferred that I am -inveighling against the artistic merits of Chippendale and his coadjutors, I only speak of his shortcomings as a reminder,that even Homer himself sometimes nods. The chairs and table shown in Fig. 90 are fine examples of the masters\\' work and are really handsome designs, and paragons of good construction and faithful workmanship. -We show two plates — Nos. VIII and IX of Chippendale designs, which, with what we have shown in the foregoing pages, will enable our readers to recognize this master\\'s work at sight. Plate VIII, illustrates some of his best work, especially the chair backs shown at 11 and 12. The other backs shown 1, 3 and 9 are not so chaste but are favorites with some people. The designs shown on Plate IX, are very clever, and in some instances, beautiful but are not by any means up to the best standard of Chippendale\\'s work. -Perhaps on the whole, Sheraton, was as popular as any of the great English masters, and in our opinion, -justly so, for his work was, in many instances, as chaste in design, as finely finished and much more substantial in construction than the work turned out by Chippendale or Heppelwhite. Sheraton succeeded Chippendale -in fashionable esteem, and was a more sober and elegant designer. His pieces never offend the eye, but, on the other hand, they are not so characteristic as those of his less artistic predecessor. The double chair, Fig. 91, covered with a piece of Aubusson tapestry, is in his style, though it may not be of his make. He was very ingenious in inventions of the sort, and numerous contrivances for getting double service out of chairs and tables, are ascribed to him. The sofa, Fig. 92, is an excellent example of the same taste, for the alliance of straight lines with refined curves, on which his fame chiefly rests; indeed, reticence in ornament was his study. -The sofa shown in Fig. 93, is a dainty work both in design and finish, and is a typical Sheraton. The two -settles shown at Fig. 94 and 95, are Sheraton\\'s work and are good examples of his style on furniture of this -kind. They are evidently derived from the sofa of the period, diminished in size and robbed of its back. -of its class, well worthy of reproduction, notwithstanding that the center-table is at present out of favor. The diagram, Fig. 97, explains the somewhat unusual construction, and shows how the problem of drawers in a circular plan has been solved. The fictitious quadrant-drawers are really little cupboards, as is indicated in the working drawing. That any manufacturer to-day would invest the labor needed to make this table properly, is perhaps, doubtful; yet the elements of its construction deserves study and adaptation. -The little table, and the arm-chair shown at Fig. 98, are fine chaste specimens of the Sheraton period and could well afford to be imitated. If space allowed we would very much like to publish three or four plates of Sheraton\\'s designs, but we have already devoted more space than we first intended, so in this case we offer one Plate, X, which shows up quite a number of Sheraton\\'s -best designs ; and these, along with the figured illustrations, will, we think, make sufficient exhibits for one purpose. -Plates XI and XII show some fine examples of Heppelwhite\\'s work. These are choice specimens of this style, and show up some very good work. Plate XII exhibits six sideboards, four pedestals, and a tea chest by Heppelwhite. The dimensions of the sideboards -are :— Length, from 5^ ft. to 7 ft. ; height, 3 ft. ; depth, 28 in. to 32 in. The notes referring to Nos. 5, 8, 9, and 1 1 state that \"the ornaments to the fronts . . . may be carved, painted, or inlaid with various colored woods.\" The pedestals were made of the same height as the sideboards, were generally about 16 in. or 18 in. -square, and were often surmounted by vases from 2 ft. to 2 ft. 3 in. high. The ornamentation of the tea chest may, according to Heppel white\\'s book, either be inlaid, or \"painted and varnished.\" -Heppelwhite, while he did not reach the height in public esteem that Chippendale and Sheraton did, his work was much sought for and enormous prices were paid for examples, and to-day, when fashion has changed somewhat, well authenticated examples command prices that place them beyond the reach of or-dinary purses. Cases are quoted where a single chair brought as much as 200\\' dollars. The designs which we illustrate could, probably, be reproduced for one-third of that sum, and with the carving omitted for still less. That is assuming that costly wood, like rosewood or mahogany, is exacted, and providing for the very best workmanship; quite as artistic results may be obtained as in those of the originals. -The most notable difference between the chairs of Heppelwhite and Chippendale is that the latter affected the large square backs and ultra-French details never -to the taste of Heppelwhite, who in his own book says : \\'\\'Our idea of the useful, in such articles as are generally serviceable in real life, is to unite elegance and utility, and blend the useful with the agreeable\"; this as he elsewhere points out, was better attained by allowing -English taste and workmanship full play, than alien styles too literally with many anacronisms. The four Heppelwhite arm chairs shown in Fig. 99 are fair samples of the style and show in them, the peculiar characteristics of the Heppelwhite treatment. -The general dimensions of Heppelwhite\\'s chairs are 19 or 20 inches for the width of the front; for the depth of the seat and length of seat frame, 17 inches each, and the total height about 3 ft. 1 in. He especially prided himself on the painted \"japanned\" decoration in his actual productions ; yet in writing he disclaimed the mere novelty of such fugitive decorations and most strongly recommended the more durable method of in-laying, although he confesses the former was pretty enough while it lasted. This divergence between theory and practice has always ruled in furniture, for, chosen -solely for its fashion and appearance by most buyers, no absurd innovation has failed to find a responsive purchaser. -Perhaps, of all the styles of furniture known, there is not one of them that appeals to the refined artistic feelings more than that evolved by the Adam Brothers -— Richard and James — who, in their early youth, became recognized as masters of elegant design. At this date, it is practically impossible to obtain a copy of their works, and to look them over Students are obliged to go to some National Library. There are copies we believe in the Lennox Library, New York, but we do not know of any other original work of theirs in the United States or even of copies of them. Examples of the work of these two men are scarcely ever found in the market, but when such is the case, the demand for fhem is so great that ridiculously high prices are paid for their possession. The efforts of these designers were secured altogether by royalty and the Nobility, and this accounts largely for the scarcity of examples. -Plates XIII and XIV, show a few examples of work in this style. Plate XIII shows a number of details for furniture and general house finish. Plate XIV shows a portion of an octagon Boudoir in this style, with several pieces of furniture and fittings. This style is better known as \"The Adam\\'s Classic Style,\" and is very beautiful indeed. -With this (Plate XIV) we will close this essay on \"style,\" as those we have mentioned cover pretty nearly all those various modes of construction and decoration worthy of the name of \"style.\" -We have not said much of the \"Gothic Style\" for this is not supposed to be employed — only for church work, though sometimes it is made use of in dwellings for -the clergy, or similar purposes. We may have more to say of \"Gothic,\" later on. The \"New Art\" or \"Art Nouveau,\" which was in such vogue a few years ago, was simply a \"fad,\" and is now dead, and properly so — and is not likely to be even resurrected. We devote one Plate, XV, to this fad, so that posterity may have some idea as to what \"Art Nouveau\" was, \"once upon a time.\" -dreams or not ; Yet I dyd see soe vyvydly what I wyll eke rehearse, I wyst some lesson there must be yn thys, my humble -Yt soe befell upon a daye ye desygn I\\'d conceyve, I drew yt not for Art, buy paye, my fortune to ret rye ve ; I took yt to a fact\\'ry wyght, syth he was kynd to me, I thought he eke yn kyndness myght some meryt yn yt see. -\"The Mission fad, is nearly as unartistic as the \"Art Nouveau\" and because of its easy construction, is likely to become more popular. This should be called \"The carpenter style,\" for every carpenter having a fair knowledge of his trade, should be able to make almost any kind of \"Mission Furniture.\" This style has no Artistic merit other than its simplicity and honesty. -On plate XV, a number of picturesque examples of \"Swiss work\" is shown. We offer these examples because of their artistic features, and their appropriateness for articles of furniture for sea or lakeside cottages, or bungalows. All these articles shown are easily made and as easily kept clean if left in a natural condition. -Fig. ioo shows an old Scandinavian choir which exhibits good solid workmanship. Fig. 101 shows a room -fitted up in oriental style with a few pieces of oriental furniture shown where some idea as to the shape and style of decoration of such furniture may be gleaned. Fig. 1 02, shows an ebony \\'Koran\" holder, from -The chairs shown in Fig. 104, are of old German type and are, without doubt, a pair of cosy, comfortable chairs. The woodwork on them seems to be ash, but is -dark with age. The stiff prim looking chair shown in Fig. 105, is of old Dutch parentage, and has a stately, if not a lordly appearance. -Fie. 106, shows another old Dutch chair, with cabriole legs. This is rather a pretentious affair. The Italian chair shown at Fig. 107 is of late Italian Renaissance style and is overloaded with unnecessary and -frivolous carvings. It is a comfortable chair to sit in but is unwieldly and ponderous. Fig. 108, exhibits a neat German chair suitable for a library, den or even a hall. The carving on it, is chaste and excellently wrought. -the most dainty pieces of furniture in existence. It was probably made by Oeban or Riesner and shows the most exquisite workmanship. As a mere matter of value it would probably fetch about thrice its weight in gold. It is throughout a model of the finest art workmanship, within and without; the beautiful marquetry panels ; the elaborately chased metal mounts ; the choice little porcelain requisites might each form the subject of a special essay. The table has only to be seen to be coveted. We are convinced that nothing we have seen of this description before or after, can compare in elegance and beauty with this little escritoire, once used by Marie Antoinette. -The table shown in Fig. no, is German, and has a massive characteristic look, it is intended for library purposes. Fig. 1 1 1 shows a work table made for the -ill-fated Marie Antoinette and is considered a gem in its way and has a value far beyond the reach of ordinary mortals. -The table shown in Fig. 112, is in Mahogany and was executed for the war department, Washington. D. C. It is a fine specimen of American workmanship. It was made in Boston, Mass. The dainty little writing desks shown in Figs. 113 and 1 14, are of French manufacture of the period of Marie Antoinette, and were the forerunners of many of the present beautiful writing desks that are being made now by the thousands in -some of our Cabinet factories. They are worth imitating as they contain many features of beauty and good taste. -Stepping from chairs and tables to cabinets we have a large field to gather from, but it is not our intention -to deal at length with these articles, so a few examples must suffice. The Cabinet — or Armoire, as it is called in French — shown in Fig. 115 is said to be one of the finest pieces of woodwork in the world. It was designed -by Berain, and executed by Boulle, for Louis XIV. The delicacy and beauty of the coloring of the inlaid brass work, in metal of two tints, the boldness of the arabesque work, and the fine proportions and unusual -The German cabinet shown in Fig*. 116, is a very fine example of workmanship, and nearly equals the French work in Artistic merit. The cabinet shown at Fig. 117, is not given for its beauty, but because of the usefulness, and combined purposes. It is in Queen Anne style and may prove suggestive, if nothing more. -two very fine cabinets well suited to receive curios and artistic trinkets. They are artistically designed. -Wall, or hanging cabinets, are very useful articles of furniture, and designs for them are numerous — -many of which are good — but we give a few herewith, which we think possess several good features. The two designs shown at Fig. 120 are very simple but very effective. The same may be said of the three designs shown in Fig. 121. These latter may be used for cabinets to hang on a flat wall, or for corner cabinets. -The Gothic style followed the Romanesque or roundarched. In France and England it developed towards the end of the twelfth century. In this country the Decorated Gothic was the second stage (during the fourteenth century), and the Perpendicular Gothic followed in the fifteenth. -The Moorish or Saracenic developed in the eighth century. It was the style of the Mohammedans. A feature of the style is its extraordinary geometrical combinations. The Alhambra (Granada), built in the thirteenth century, is considered the most perfect specimen of architecture in this style. -Francis I. belongs to the Early French Renaissance ( 1 515-1549). It is freely ornamented Gothic, developing under Italian influence. Its feature is a minuteness of detail. The palace of Fontainebleau was built in this style by Francis I. -Henry II. (Middle French Renaissance), who followed Francis L, developed the existing style along lines of greater purity, more closely resembling the original Italian. Many of the details in this style are applicable to modern requirements. -Henri IV. brings us to the period of the Late French Renaissance ( 1 589-1610). A study of the illustrations following will clearly show the tendency of the time, preparing the way for the magnificence of the Louis XIV. style (treated later). -Louis XIV. ( 1 643-1 715). Magnificence in decorative designing. The era of Chas. le Brun, Andre Chas. Boulle, Jean Berain, Jean Le Pautre, and Daniel Marot. -Louis XV. (1723-1774), Rococo period. The leading men of the time are Watteau, Nicholas Pineau, Jacques Caffieri, Jules Aurele Meissonier, Jacques Blondel, Denizol, Chas. Cressent, Oeben, Tessier, and Martin (originator of Vernis-Martin panels). -Louis XVI. (1774-1792-), Era of daintiness and grace. Rococo ornament suppressed. The boudoir supersedes the salon. The leading men were Gouthiere, David Roentgen, and Riesner. -The Empire was a return, under Napoleon, to the classic styles of Greece and Rome. Details include decorated cornices, caryatides, pilasters, etc. -The English Renaissance was introduced at the beginning of the Sixteenth Century. The Elizabethan was its \"golden age.\" The details on Page 121 are from the chimney-piece in the library at Holland House, the fretwork is from Audley End, and the carved panel is at the South Kensington Museum. -Chippendale (1754) needs little comment. His designs include French details, and also show signs of Chinese influence. -Sheraton ( 1751) is too well known to need description. The details given in this style are illustrative of all phases of his work. -Adam (1773) details are architectural, the furniture of the Brothers Adam being chiefly constructed to harmonize with the buildings in which it was to be used. -In a simple treatise it is quite impossible to conveyany adequate idea of the art of cabinet-making. So much could be said that it is most difficult to know what to leave out, and however fully this subject may be enlarged upon, the broad fact that but one-half has been told must remain. Further, a budding cabinetmaker will learn more during the first twelve months of his apprenticeship than all the text-books in the country can teach him. The old Roman motto, Ezperientia docet, is truer to-day than ever. Experience has been, and will be, the best teacher ; but just as it is possible to start in life with better prospects upon the solid foundations laid by one\\'s forebears, so by the aid of a few practical suggestions may a youth be helped upward on the ladder of perfection. The cabinet-maker must always strive after excellence. There is absolutely no room for men who are only halfmasters of their craft ; the net result of incompetence is a general leveling of the highest to the least efficient, a diminution of the rate of wages, and a disastrous lowering of the quality of work. The various styles of workmanship should incite the cabinet trade of today to patient and thoughtful work. It may be urged — and possibly truly — that these master-pieces of which we speak were not the daily product of the age which produced them. That inferior work was then produced -may be admitted; but the mere fact that time has wrought its destruction should be sufficient evidence that this class of work is not such as the twentiethcentury cabinet-maker should imitate. -And here one word to the journeyman of to-day. The apprentice working under your superintendence will be exactly as you make him. Men are copyists ever, and youth is the most impressionable period. See to it, then, that your work be such as the novice treading in your footsteps may safely follow. And let the apprentice benefit by his master\\'s experience, commencing where the latter leaves off, and thus raising the handicraft to a higher level of excellence. The only true way to success is that the heart be in the work; toiling not merely for the \"standard wage,\" nor creating a piece of work only to \"sell/\\' but to last. -Just as to-morrow is the child of to-day, so is the journey-man the fulfilment of the apprenticeship. The groundwork of early days is the foundation upon which the after-work stands, and if the first be faulty then is there but inefficiency hereafter. One word as to the influence of trades-unionism upon the cabinet trade — it has its strong and weak points. On the one hand it demands, and rightly, from the master a standard rate of wage, which is beneficial insomuch ;that it puts all union shops on the same level, and prevents that \"cutting\" policy which is alike disastrous to good work and sound finance. On the other hand it gives no guarantee -of efficiency in the worker ; good and bad are linked in one union, with the result that the least efficient are often out of work and maintained at the expense of their more skilled brothers. The remedy for this seems to lie here : let no man be made a member until he has passed through a satisfactory apprenticeship, and proved himself to be thoroughly acquainted with his trade, and capable of honestly earning the wage demanded; then would the term \"union man\" be understood to mean skill and efficiency, and be as proud a possession of the man earning it as a degree to a college graduate. -Possibly it may be thought that the proceeding lines have savoured too much of the ethics of labor — of work in its highest and ideal form — rather than of the practical teaching of a competing age. But there is a danger that in the mad rush for cheap and badly manufactured furniture the true constructive art may be lost, and a race of men produced wedded to one job, year in and year out, and turning out work bearing neither the stamp of individuality nor the spirit of good workmanship. -Where a draughtsman is not employed, the usual method of setting out work is to make a full-size detail from the scale-drawing supplied.. This is done most conveniently upon 36-inch lining-paper strained upon a board, say 7 ft. x 4 ft. This size will be found to be large enough for most jobs, which need only be drawn -in the majority of cases to the center line, thus showing half the width of the job, the other half being a repeat. The thickness-sections, for the sake of clearness, may be put in with blue or red pencil. Having accomplished this, the next proceeding will be to take off the drawing the various sizes of the several pieces of wood, allowing sufficient margin for finishing to the net sizes, and for the length of tenons, &c. Many of the small pieces can be obtained from the \"scrap\"-room, where all sorts of ends, strips, &c, are stored in their respective classes, thus saving the cutting of a large board for the purpose of an odd rail or so, which might render it useless by reason of a corner having been cut away. -Tools. — The trade of to-day is so much the product of machine labor, that in a fully-equipped shop, where furniture is made to \"stock\" designs, the manual work is little more than that of fitting together the various parts. It is, however, still necessary that the craftsman should be fully acquainted with the use of the tools usually associated with the cabinet-maker\\'s bench. The following list includes all those commonly required, but special tools may be necessary in certain cases : -CABINET MAKERS\\' JOINTS, &c. What may be termed \"edge-joints\" are a necessity in cabinet-making, because timber is not always obtainable wide enough for the counter-top or panel desired; and if it were so, the cost would prohibit its general use; but more because a jointed top or panel will stand much better than a single piece, and this is the chief thing to be aimed at. There is a tendency in some quarters to avoid jointing, but the policy is an unsound one. Again, in the case of oak panelling, a much better effect can be obtained by a jointed panel — throwing all the figures to the center line — than by a single unjointed board. The chief objection to jointing seems to lie in the idea that sooner or later the joint will give; it may, just as anything is likely to happen in badly-constructed work, but given thoroughly dry and seasoned timber, a sound method of jointing, and a good workman to do it, nothing need be feared. The -necessity for jointing will, of course, be governed by the width of the timber employed. It may, however, be taken as a general rule that nothing wider than 13 or 14 inches should be used in a single piece, except in the case of countertops, which often run 3 feet 6 inches to 4 feet wide, and should only have one joint. -There are several methods of jointing which we will now consider in detail: (1) Glue joint; (2) Giue-anddowel; (3) Tongue-and-groove (or rebate); and (4) Double groove and loose tongue. -The Glue Joint shown in Fig. 123 is perhaps the commonest of cabinet joints for such work as bears no weight, — that is, perpendicular work, as carcase ends. The method of making the joints is briefly thus : The two boards are shot with a trying or jointing plane until the surface edges are absolutely true; one piece is placed in the bench-cramp, the other being held so that -the two edges are together; run thin glue along the joint, then work the loose board backwards .and forwards along its fellow until the superfluous glue is extracted; the joint should now be allowed to set. If the work has been well done the wood is much more likely -to break at some other point than the joint. Complete success depends upon two factors — true jointing with the plane, and good glue. There are so many good makes of the latter that there should be no difficulty whatever in obtaining it. Remember that the best glue is always the cheapest, for two reasons — its adhesive qualities and capacity for absorption of water. Good glue should take up its own weight of water, i. e., i lb. of glue in the oake should produce 2 lbs. weight in liquid -form. The joint to be glued should be thoroughly warmed, as this makes the glue much more adhesive than if applied to a cold surface. -addition of a series of dowels placed along the joint, the object being to ensure greater strength for such purposes as a countertop. The dowels may be ft inch or y 2 inch in diameter, according to the thickness of the timber to be jointed. They should be placed (say) 12 inches apart and bored in 1 inch deep, the end of the dowel glued and knocked in with a framing hammer, then sawn off to the depth of the corresponding hole, and the ends of the dowels rounded over; glue both edges of the joint, the dowels, and dowel-holes, knock down, and cramp up. The superfluous glue will thus be -The Tongue-and-Groove Joint, Fig. 125, possesses advantages not found in the preceding ones, viz. a greater strength, and should the joint \"give,\" the presence of the tongue prevents light from showing through. With -a pair of match-planes make a groove on one piece onethird the width of the timber used, by half an inch deep, and make a corresponding tongue on the other piece. When this has been done, fit the two together, seeing that the tongue will move freely along the groove, then glue and rub together as in Fig. 123, and cramp up. -In the Double Groove and Loose Tongue (Fig. 126) — the main idea seems to be that when jointing two soft-woods together a hard-wood tongue (which should be cut across the grain) may be inserted, rendering the -joint less liable to snap than if a tongue were cut on the soft-wood itself and lengthways with the grain. Proceed as in Fig. 125, only making two grooves, each the same width and depth; glue the joints and loose tongue ; rub, and cramp up. -We have previously spoken of straight jointing for panels, carcass ends, &c, but the methods described are not suitable for the joints of pieces meeting at an angle, as in the framing of a door or of panelling. Joints of this kind may be considered under four heads: (1) Dovetailing ; ( 2 ) Mortise-and-tenon ; ( 3 ) Dowel ; and (4) Mitre. Two broad principles would seem to govern these, viz. that the wood employed be absolutely dry, and that the joint be true. Any deviation from either of these fixed rules must result in failure; and the second is to a large extent dependent on the first, for however good the workmanship may be, if the wood be unseasoned shrinkage must inevitably occur, with the result that it is almost impossible to put the work right when once the job has been framed up. Hence the necessity of insisting that absolutely dry stuff is an essential in the cabinet trade. -1. Dovetailing*— Fig. 127, is undoubtedly the joint par excellence for cabinet work ; it takes three forrns. No. 1 represents the ordinary open dovetail. Each piece to be^ clp-vetailed is marked with a gauge and regulator, spacing the dovetails according to the width of wood to be jointed. This form is used wherever the -construction is hidden from view, its defect being that the ends of the dovetail are cut completely through, thus showing, if exposed, the end grain of the \"keys\" of the other piece. When this is not desired the dovetail is made as No. 2. All dovetails should be cut wedge-shaped, so that when glued and hammered they will tighten up, and when smoothed down present a perfect joint. -The overlapping or concealed dovetail (No. 2) is used in drawer fronts, where it is desirable to conceal the mode of construction. The dovetail is cut entirely through the side, but only two-thirds through the front ; the joint, therefore, is visible on the end only and not on the front. This is an absolute necessity in the case of veneering, for which purpose an absolutely flat surface must be obtained, otherwise the \"keys\" would show through the thin veneer and spoil the whole effect. The jointing up and finishing is precisely the same as in No. 1. -The mitre-dovetailed (No. 3) is adopted for fine work where it is undesirable to show the dovetail either on front or side, and consists of a dovetail having a mitre on each outside edge; the finished joint appears as a single mitre without disclosing the dovetail within. -The Mortise-and-Tenon is the most satisfactory joint for two pieces in the same plane meeting at an angle ; it takes a variety of forms (Fig. 128). The main point to be borne in mind is that the parts to form the -joint be cut true; otherwise, either the tenon will be slack and the joint useless, or too tight and will split open the mortise. -tenon will be slightly wedged. Other methods of fixing the joints are : ( i ) to make the mortise large enough to admit of a wedge being driven in on each side the tenon, which effectually \"keys\" it; in this case the tenon is usually put in dry, that is without glue; and (2) to split open the tenon with a chisel, and insert a wedge in the center and drive home. The danger of -this method is that the tenon is liable to be necked off at the shoulder, while in the former case the rail may be split. If the mortise and tenon are fitted true, no wedging should be necessary. -The thickness of the tenon should be one-third that of the rail and the width not more than 4 inches. If a wider rail has to be used, it would be better to make two mortises and tenons, as shown in Nos. 4 and 5. -can be made as shown, or of the full width between the grooves, which are made on either side for the purpose of receiving the panels. -mortises. These should be cut slightly deeper than the tenon, the joint being glued up and cramped. -Nos. 4 and 5. — Methods of framing wide rails by means of double-tenons, suitable for doors where wide rails are necessary. No. 4 is usually called a gunstock joint. -In framing angles having moulds on one or both edges, the moulds may be intersected either by mitring or scribing. In the mitred joint, the moulds are cut down at an angle of 45 degrees to the mortise-hole, and the moulds adjoining the tenon are cut to fit. The only danger in this method is that, if the wood is wet the mitre will dry in, leaving an open space impossible to deal with. -The process of scribing (Fig. 130) is to cut under one of the rails to the pattern of the other which it is -intended to join ; but this cannot so easily be done with mouldings containing many members, as it would be too costly. It, however, has the advantage that, if shrinkage occurs, the joint can be knocked up again, which would be impossible in the former case. -although not invariably. Fig. 131 shows a scribed joint for panel-mouldings. The vertical moulding C is cut away at A to fit on to the horizontal moulding D. The thick line AB shows the line the scribe will make at the point of intersection. -3. Dowel-Joint (Fig. 132) though often adopted, as it economizes labor, is not as satisfactory as the mortiseand-tenon. The dowels, which are usually }i inch in diameter, often shrink, causing the joint to \"give.\" If the dowels are of beech and the timber dry, the joint should be satisfactory. The usual method of setting out a doweljoint is to cut a piece of paper the size of the rail and prick through the centers required according to -the number of dowels desired. These are afterwards marked upon the timber itself. If the wood is not more than i inch thick, the dowels should be set out in the center of the rail in a straight line ; if thicker wood is used, put the dowels in zigzag fashion, which is the better way where it can be managed. -Where small sizes are used, the joint at the angle formed by two pieces not in the same plane is usually mitred. The construction of the joint is thus hidden. No. i, Fig. 133, shows an ordinary mitre at an angle of 45 degrees, such as is used in the framing of a plinth or cornice frieze; the joint is strengthened by a block inside. No. 2 represents the same method, with the additional safeguard of keys ; this would be adopted in the case of thin wood where the mitre surface is very -small, and where there is consequently a liability to break ; the keys are usually put in with veneer, a saw-cut being all that is necessary for their insertion. Glue is run in and the joint levelled off. No. 3 is a variation of No. i. -Fig. 134, shows an angle framed by dowels, having on the one edge a bead, which breaks the joint; this would be used in framing a pilaster upon the end of a carcass. -No. 1, Fig. 136, shows the method of framing a through rail intersected into a center leg, not more than three inches square. No. 2 shows the construction if the center leg is above that size, and is not mortised or dowelled. No. 3 is copied from an old card-table ; the shouldering and dovetailing of the rail show advantages over No. 1, -A cornice may be worked out of the solid piece or built up in various pieces. The latter form is usually adopted by cabinet-makers, except for small cornices. No. i, Fig. 137, shows a built-up mould; the pieces -should be glued and screwed together, blocks being put at the back to give additional strength. No. 2 shows a solid hardwood moulding faced upon softwood, the mould having a rebate for the insertion of a dentil (shown by dotted lines), egg-and-dart, or other ornament. -Ofttimes the cabinet-maker is left to design the mouldings, in which case it is absolutely necessary that he be thoroughly conversant with the mouldings of the particular style or period in which he is working, as a Gothic mould would be out of place upon a Renaissance piece of work, and a Jacobean cornice upon a Sheraton -job. If the designer is not conversant with the grammar of ornament, all kinds of incongruous mixtures are -created, neither true to style nor beautiful. The same remarks apply also to carving and turnery, and as there -are so many text-books of style published, there is absolutely no excuse for ignorance in this matter. -Another point upon which a word may be said is the proportioning of mouldings one to the other in the building-up of a cornice. Let it be supposed that one has to be stuck by hand. It is frequently possible to pick out a series of stock members all the same size, Figure 139 -and to strike out a variety of cornices by ringing the changes on them. The result, however, will be a moulding as shown in No. 1, Fig. 138, where all the members, a,b,c,d,e,f, are of equal depth. This is both incorrect and inelegant ; no moulding made up of a series of members should have any two in conjunction of the same depth, but the proportion should be varied after the manner shown in No. 2, the effect of which — it will be at once apparent — is much better than No. 1. -In cabinet-work the methods of hanging a door, table-leaf, &c, to its corresponding part, are simple, and the foundation of the joint varies but little, though in the case of hanging a door with heavy projecting moulding and cornice upon the face, special long-shouldered butts would be used. The main point in all hangings by -means of hinges is to see that each hinge bears its due proportion of weight, thus avoiding strain and consequent friction and possibly breakage. -Hinges may be of cast or malleable iron, steel, brass, copper, gun-metal, or a combination of metals, such as brass with steel washers ; for heavy work these washers should always be used, the wearing parts being stronger. -The earliest form of hinge seems to have been in the form of an oak pin (A Fig. 139) shaped from the rail itself, and working in a socket cut into the cross rail above, the doors being framed up with the job itself; the form is common in fifteenth and sixteenth century woodwork. Later, the influence of Flemish work. is -apparent, and the pinjoint gives place to wrought-iron hinges placed upon the face of the door and frame with artistic effect, and attached by means of large-headed hails (Fig. 140). During the Queen Anne and Chippendale periods, the hinges were delicately made of cast brass and fixed by screws. -The ordinary way of hanging by butts is shown in No. 1, Fig. 141, the rebate is not carried through the wood, and the knuckle projects on the front side. If this is not desired, the hinges must be fixed flush, and a bead of the. same thickness as the knuckle run down -to make a better finish. When a lid is to be hinged, it would be done as in No. 2, the overhang at the back being, in the case of a small lid, sufficient to serve as a stop when the lid is open. -In hanging a table-leaf, many forms may be adopted. No. 1, Fig. 142, shows a beaded and rebated joint, the center of the hinge being directly under the joint. Exccpt for dust-proof or light-tight purposes, the rebate is not necessary. This joint would open to 90 degrees. Should the leaf or door require to fold back behind the other part, the hinp-e should be placed as shown in No. 2, the dotted lines showing the position of the leaf when -folded back. Another form of leaf hanging is that known as a \"rule joint,\" which is shown closed in No. 3, and open in No. 4. This has the advantage of concealing the hinge, and making a better finish when open -than otherwise would be the case ; the joint is somewhat difficult to get true, but always repays the labor in effect. A variation of this joint is shown in No. 5. -.Carcass doors are generally hung as shown in No. 1, Fig. 143, a bead the size of the knuckle being run down to break the joint, and the hinge rebated into the -door its entire thickness. No. 2 shows the method of hanging on to the ends of a carcass* where the full clearance of the door is desired, such as would be the case in a cupboard fitted with sliding trays. No. 3 shows the same method, but with air-tight bead for a cabinet or show-case. -Center hanging, as for wardrobe doors, is shown in Nos. 4 and 5, the door being set back in a rebate, or having a pilaster planted on to hide the joint. Sometimes this joint is made on the rule principle, but this adds to the expense. -Special hinges, such as are made for card-tables, bureaus, pianos, &c, while varying in shape and size to suit requirements, are fitted in exactly the same manner as the foregoing illustrations indicate. -It is not our intention to offer much in the line of practical examples, showing details, dimensions of materials and methods of making such examples ; but it is thought a few instances specified in full, may prove of use to the apprentice and younger workmen, who may, want to \"make things\" during their leisure hours, or at odd times. We start off with a piece of work in the socalled mission style and which is easy to make. This makes a good table for a library, a den or an office. Besides fulfilling its purpose as a library table, it can be used as a bookcase, where the library is very small, and for a writing desk. The writing materials can be kept in the drawer and the absence of a lower shelf makes it possible to put the feet well under the table without interference. -The best lumber to use is oak, plain or quartered, as suits the convenience and pocket-book of the builder. Order it from the mill as follows and insist on its being well sanded before you accept it, as this greatly lessens the labor involved in its building. -Three-eighth inch dowel pins should be used to fasten the shelves and top onto the legs, and if you run them through the legs, cover the ends with wooden buttons. The drawer linings can be nailed in place as the nailheads will not show, and the other pieces can be screwed in place. -If desired, birch or other hard-wood may be used in lieu of oak, and the whole may be stained to suit the taste. -The illustrations show the method of construction and positions of rails, &c, and as they are all figured, showing lengths and positions, there will be no trouble in laying the table out or assembling the parts. -Fig. 144, shows a general plan and sideelevation, and Fig. 145 shows end elevation, whileFig> 146, gives a perspective view of the finished work. -147. This table is quite simple and may be easily made by an apprentice or any person who understands the use of ordinary woodworking tools. The table is equally suitable for use in the parlor, library or living room. -Fig. 148 is the side plan and dimensions of the table. The bottom footboard can be made twelve inches wide and held in place with three round-head brass screws at each end, which will make it very strong and neat in appearance. -Fig. 149 shows all dimensions and specifications for the ends. The top and bottom rails are ]/% inch thick, while the slats are only % inch. -The top is held to the frame by glueing cleats on the inside of the top rails, then running screws through them into the top. -All the joints are tenon and mortise and glued. The ends are glued and clamped first, then the top side, rails, while the bottom foot -board comes last. -These two examples exhibit the whole method of Mission furniture construction, and are quite sufficient to serve our purposes. -The sideboard which is shown in perspective without the drawers by Fig. 1 50, has been designed specially for those with limited experience, and in its construction mortises, tenons, and dovetails are avoided. For fixing the various parts, glue and nails are only required. -Planed pine boarding as used for building purposes, will be found suitable; and when finished the job may be stained and varnished to suit. Fig. 151, is a half front elevation, and Fig. 152, end elevation, each drawer to scale. -The measurements may be taken from these two Figures, but for simplicity the finished sizes of the various pieces of wood are as follows: i-in. stuff (finishing about % in. thick), top A (Fig. 151 and 152), 4 ft. 6 in. by 1 ft. 8 in. ; ends B, 3 ft. by 1 ft. 5 in. ; bottom C, 3 ft. io^4 in. by 1 ft. 5 in. ; upper ends D, 2 ft. 6 in. by S l / 2 in. ; cornice E, 4 ft. 5 in. by 10^2 in. ; pediment F, 4 ft. by 6 in. (widest part) ; drawers bearer G, 3 ft. ioy 2 in. by 3% in. ; division H between drawers, 1 ft. 5 in. by 4^2 in. ; brackets J, 6 in. by 5 in. ; shaped span-rail K, 3 ft. 10^2 in. by 3 in. ; and corner shelves, 11 in. by 7 in. The pieces of ^4-in. stuff are: For the doors (made of three thicknesses of stuff), four stiles L, 2 ft. 1 in. by 3 in.; four cross rails 1 ft. $% in. by 3 in., and for the back face of the doors, four -stiles i ft. 7^/2 in. by 2^4 in., and four cross rails i ft. 1 1 34 in. by 2j4 in. The J^-in. stuff required (finishing about yi in.) is: Two door panels, i ft. yYi in. by i ft. -SH in. wide; carcass back M (Fig. 152), sufficient matchboarding -3 ft. high at the ends and 4 ft. in width ; for drawer fronts, two pieces N (Fig. 153), 1 ft. io}i in. by 4 J / 2 in.; two pieces O (Fig. 153), 1 ft. 10^ in. by 4 T / 2 in.; for the drawer sides P (Fig. 154), four pieces 1 ft. 4% in. rjy 4 l / 2 in.; drawer backs Q (Fig. -154), two pieces 1 ft. io}i in. by $ l / 2 in. ; for the upper part of the sideboard (made up of three thicknesses of stuff), two front stiles R (Fig. 151), 2 ft. 6 in. by 2*4 in. ; two inner stiles S, 1 ft. 4 in. by 2j4 in. ; cross rails T, 3 ft. 6 in. by 3% in. ; cross rails U and V, 3 ft. 6 in. by 2% in. ; panel W, 3 ft. 6 l / 2 in. by 6]/ 2 in. ; -panel X, 1 ft. 4>4 in. by 1 ft. 4 J / 2 in. by 8^2 in. For inner layer Y and back layer Z (see Figs. 155 and 156, and 157), allow the stiles and rails to be % in. narrower than the front layer R, S, T, U, and V (Fig. 151). The shaped headings of the panels in the doors and top part are % in. thick. The top and ends being wider than the usual width of deal boards, these will have to be jointed and glued. White wood or pine can be obtained wide enough without joining; both woods are very suitable for varnishing. -In beginning the construction, the wood should be first planed to thickness, then the front edges, next the ends squared up, and finally taken to width. The bottom C is fixed with 2 J / 2 -in. oval nails driven through the ends B. Oval nails have small heads and are less un-sightly when the work is filled up for varnishing or polishing. Next the bearer G and then top A are nailed in the same way. When nailing, if the nails are driven -slantwise, alternately leaning towards the front and back, they will act like dovetails, and prevent the top from lifting or the ends drawing away from the bot-torn. The latter may also be prevented by screwing a strip to the under side of the bottom C and to the ends as shown in Fig. 158. Note that the top projects -ij4-in. nails. The outer edges M (Fig. 152) should be worked half-round in section with a smoothing plane and course glasspaper; it will then look like a bead moulding worked on the back edges of the ends. -The doors made up of two thicknesses may next be taken in hand. Fig. 159 shows the stiles L fixed with glue and nails to the back cross rails ; the front rails and back stiles are next fitted. Note that the back stiles and rails are % in. narrower than the front, so as to provide a rebate for the panels; see Fig. 160, which is an enlarged section of the door, stiles, and panel. When the doors are together, the shaped headings may be fitted; or for a better construction, the stiles and top rail could be rebated to receive it. -The drawer sides are nailed to the inner front O (Fig. 153) and back Q (Fig. 154). Strips A \\'(Fig. 154) are nailed to the sides for the bottom to rest on, the latter passing under the back O. The outer drawer front N is nailed to the drawer sides and glued to O. Of course, this method of construction is only to avoid dovetailing and ploughed grooves for the bottom. -The framing of the top part (Fig. 161) is fitted between ends D (Figs. 151 and 152) and under the shelf E, and rests on the top A. The method of construction is similar to the doors, the joints of the outer face being as shown in Fig. 151. The middle portion Y -is as shown in Fig. 161, and the back face Z (Figs. 155, 156, and 157) the same as the front face in Fig. 151. The center mirror may be of bevelled-edge or plain silvered plate; or if desired a wood panel could be fixed. The half circular headings are fixed as described for the doors. The corner shelves, ends D, and shelf E are fixed to the framing with 2-in. nails. -to the lower by driving screws through the under side of the top A into the ends D, also into the back framing -( Fig. 1 6 1 ) . Suitable brass or copper handles for doors and drawers will add to the appearance of the sideboard. -dissolved in hot water; less potash for oak than for walnut or mahogany. The correct shade may be got by experimenting on an odd piece of wood. When the stain is dry, give a coating of glue size. Then thin coats of varnish. When all parts show a gloss, put aside for twenty-four hours, then glasspaper, and apply the finishing coats of varnish or French polish. Bismarck brown added to the varnish will give mahogany color. -We show herewith in Figs. 162, 163, 164 and 165, part elevations and details of two low-cost sideboards, to make will be excellent practice for the younger workmen. -Fig. 162 includes center and two small side mirrors in upper part and three drawers, two cupboards and center recess in lower part. Height from A to B, 12 in.; B to C, 2 ft. 9 in. ; C to D, 3 ft. 3 in. ; cupboard door, say, 23 in. by 17 in.; depth of drawers, 5 in. outside. Turning is introduced, with alternative details for selection. Note swell and taper to turned column B, C, 2 J4in. swell, and see end elevation at Fig. 164, with 3^in. column receded. Corner B, with dentils and frieze, about 4 in. ; lined up top C, 2 24 in. moulded; 1 in. solid fronts to drawers, faced with y 2 in. moulded and mitred strips. One 5-in., or two 3^2-in. lacquered brass handles. Hobbs\\' four lever locks. Panel at E may repeat on end, less capping: Shelf inside cupboard, 1 in. moulded thumb; 2-in. brass butt hinges; i-in. -ends, and I ft. 9 in. back to front; i%-in. posts; i-in. door stiles and rails ; bottom under drawers through to back; flush framed back, }i in., let in rebates; i-in. bevel to mirror, ij^-in. framing to back. Fig. 2 all cupboard doors, wood panels moulded; center mirror, 24 in. by 28 in.; back above F, 13^ in. high; F to G, 3 ft. 1 in. ; upper door I, 19 J/2 in. by 1 1 in. ; inside depth, Sy 2 in.; lower side door, 2 ft. 6]/ 2 in. by 14 in. If a leaf is cut in posts as indicated, it will ensure a good effect. The columns supporting upper cupboard will rest on toes at G, returning to intersect with base moulding of back. The sideboard upper backs is fixed to lower carcass by dowelling into top, and also by continuing the uprights, some 9 in. or 12 in., below top to be screwed to carcass back. Either canted, as shown, or quadrant corners would be suitable for center mirror. All shelves are indicated by an outlined base. Fig. 165 gives a few details: — A refers to (Fig. 162) section, i}i in., with top turning enlarged (J) ; K, small spindles in lower carcass ; B, enlarged detail for cornice frieze and column in Fig. 162 and cornice, etc., F (Fig. 163). The pattern shown in detail at L may be carved in frieze with good effect. M, section for moulding round center mirror; N, alternative to lesser columns at C (Fig. 164) ; O, dotted line of shelf (Fig. 162) ; C, G, detail for table top (Figs. 162 and 163) of i-in. stuff lined up; D, detail for Fig. 162 at floor line, iy 2 -\\'m. section. Door frames should be mortised -right through, as at P, and moulded oriels, the geometrical framing being mitred up and turned in to intersect to patterns shown. A section through lower carcass occurs at Q for pilasters and plain moulded panels front and ends. Another method is indicated by cut at R suitable for plain ends, vertical grain, or a 9-in. upper end rail, with panelling to match E (Fig. 162). -The half-Front elevation and details of sideboard in Fig. 166 is a little more pretentious than those preceding it, and of course will tax the skill of the workman proportionately, but we do not think it beyond the ability of the ordinary trained workman. The elevation sections and details have all been drawn to scale, and are, therefore, measurable. -Fig. 166 shows the half elevation. Fig. 167 shows section of lower portion and mirror portion of upper works. Fig. 167, is the upper part of board in section. The mouldings in section require no explanations. -Cabinet-makers as a rule do not often have calls to make Grandfather\\'s clock cases, but, it does sometimes fall to the lot of the workman to make a case, so it may not be amiss to give one or two simple designs on this work, giving dimensions and style of finish. The proper material to be employed in making this case is mahogany, but of course, walnut or quartered oak — darkened — will answer very well, but in either case, good workmanship and fine finish will be necessary to give the clock an artistic appearance. -The sizes given in this example are suitable for a clock with 12 in. dial, and the remarks which follow should render the setting out a simple matter. (A) The clock case Fig. 169, consists of sides, front, and corner only, so that it may be pushed on from the front, along the moulding E, the back ends of sides being rebated to fit over the back — an arrangement which renders the clock easily accessible. Height through center of dial from bottom of door to top of cornice, 25^2 in. Height of door in center, 21 in. ; the rise being 4^4 in. ; width, 15J4 in. ; frame, 1^8 in., out of j4-in. stuff, and glazed. The door shuts on to an inner frame of same size, out of }4-in. stuff, well screwed, with glued blocks. The ends, Sy 2 in. wide (cut out in center, and glazed, as G), and continued through cornice up to springing of top curve ; frieze and cornice are built up thereon. The top or \"roof\" of case is built up of >£-in. stuff, bradded or screwed to upper member of cornice, and to top back rail on case cut to same curve, both being rebated for the purpose. The cornice projects 1 % in. over sides, being supported by columns tapering from % in. to 1 in. diam. These may either be plain or mounted, with brass Corinthian capitals and bases, the shafts then being reeded. The upper finials are also of brass, and impart a most pleasing finish to the top. It should be added that the clock movement rests upon ledges about 4 J / 2 in. high, which also serves as guides to the loose case*, and steady it when in position. Body -of clock (B) : This is constructed of J^-in. stuff — front framed (dowelled or rebated 15 in. wide) into ij/4. in. posts, the outer corners of which are canted to receive ij4 m turned pillars. Sides 7 in. wide, rebated flush into posts and top and bottom rails, and also rebated to receive back. Hide joints of rebates -with a scratched brad. Back of 34 -in. stuff shaped at top to fit upper curve. Stiffen the joints with wellfitting blocks along the inner angles, using good strong glue for the purpose. The body B beds down about 6 in. lower than the upper moulding of the base F ; sides (9 in. wide), front (19 in. wide), and back of which are rebated together and blocked. All mouldings are, of course, mitred round sides and front only. The door B (of y^-\\'m. stuff), is rebated to shut on to front, frame, and projects J4 i n only. The moulding and carved fans at C might be further embellished by an -London, whose name is engraved on the dial between V. and VII. and over the figures registering the date of the month. A minute dial occupies the upper portion -of the main dial, which is entirely of brass, the numeral disc being raised about an eighth of an inch above the central portion. The minutes are numbered throughout the circumference over the hours, and these latter are divided by fleur-de-lis. The hands are of beautiful design in steel, and the clock case is in oak. The ball -terminals are gilt, and screw into little wooden bases, as shown. At either angle beyond the dial are spandrels of cast-brass ornament in coarse style, representing two cupids bearing crossed sceptres and supporting a regal crown. The screw which fixes this ornament has a Tudor rose for its head, and forms the center of the composition. -The object, in the present design, is to make a corner chair capable of affording support to the shoulders; and in this respect the design annexed is somewhat original. The selection of the wood for same is a matter of taste; black walnut, mahogany (stained dark), rosewood, or dull black are all suitable. To save expense, it might, moreover, be made without the underframing or listing shown, although the strength would be reduced without it. But our purpose for the moment is, \"how to make,\" and a few practical hints may be useful on that point. The first business is to produce the moulds to working drawing shown, and as an inch scale is adopted, this should be a simple matter. Then get out the four legs — i. e., two long and two short. The two long legs must be out of 2 in. wood, to allow of throw over scroll at top; iy 2 in. wood will do nicely for the short ones. The seat rails must be 2 in. solid wood, and beech cannot be used except for blocking, as all the wood is more or less seen. The back might be i)A in. wood, to allow, when the top is glued on, for shaping back and front to bring it in a line with the top. The top would take a piece of 4^2 in. wood, to allow for sweep. Of course where several chairs are made, the tops can be marked one into the other, and thus waste of timber avoided ; 1 J4 m wood will be stout enough for the arms and brackets. The splat -Drawer Making and Fitting. It is often said that a man who can make and fit a drawer well can make almost anything in constructive -woodwork. This is probably true, with some reservations, for it is generally accepted as a good test of a man\\'s skill, and we have no doubt that beginners find it one of the most difficult things to tackle, especially in the preparation and \"setting out.\" The general method is as follows, applied to an average sized drawer: — Carefully select the stuff — i. e., y 2 in., finishing Y% in., for sides and back ; Y% in. or %. in. for the bottom, and I in., to finish % in. or J4 in., for the front. All the stuff should be dry and clean, as well as straight and even in the grain, and each piece must be planned up true and gauged to an equal thickness. Care must be -A handy and general workshop method is shown in Figs. 172 and 173, marked on the front of the drawer, -and the back of the back, and (2) on the front end of the sides. These marks indicate the outside and bottom edge of each piece, as well in the giving the number; and if this simple rule is applied there should be no mistake made. Where a set of drawers are the same depth, the same number should be written on the bearer or carcase. In all cases an allowance must be made on the width and length of the front and sides for fitting, and l /$ in. is ample for this ; but the sides can be squared on the shooting board at each end to the length required. It is never a good plan to let a drawer stop on to the back of a job, so the sides should be at least j4 in. or J4 in. less in length than the inside of the carcase. -After preparing the stuff, the next job is to fit it. Carefully joint one end of the front, and fit it to the corresponding end of the opening ; then mark off length -at the other end, and fit tightly in the same, but leave the top edge until the final fit of the drawer. Then \"run\" or fit the sides in — remembering the marks — taking care they fit tight from end to end, and then plane the ends of the back to fit the opening in the same way as the front. The stuff is now ready for gauging and the cutting gauge is the best of the two to use. Gauge the lap on the ends of the front first (see distance A on Fig. 174), and then on both sides of the front ends of the sides (see A, Fig. 175). Then set the gauge to the thickness of the sides, and strike a line from the ends on the inside face of the front (see B, Fig. 174) ; and this same line must be gauged from the end and on both sides of the back. Lastly, the thickness of the back must be gauged in a like manner from the back ends of the sides. It will be noted that, even if a dozen drawers are to be made, the gauge is shifted only three times, and only twice if the back is the same thickness as the sides, which should always happen when the wood is obtainable. In gauging the thicknesses, care must be taken to set the gauge a little under, but never over, or a bad fit is bound to follow. It also might happen that the best planed stuff will \"cast,\" and the sides may cast hollow in the length; whenever this does occur the round side should always be put outside. -The stuff is now ready for setting out and cutting the dovetails. Men of experience are able to just mark -off distances and cut the dovetails quickly and regularly. To those who are less skilled and beginning, a good and simple method is shown in Fig. 176. On the front end of one of the sides square down — with pencil — the lines 1 and 2, % in. from each edge, and then divide the space between these lines for the required number of dovetails. The lines will then become the center of the pins. To set out the dovetails, mark i-i6th in. each side of the line at the top and l /$ in. at the bottom; join these points, and the dovetails are given. The same method can be adopted on the fronts if the holes are to be cut first. There are various methods and many opinions as to which should be done first, but the safest course is to use the one you know and can best apply to the work at hand. We know of no simpler way of setting out dovetails than the one explained ; and it will be noted that the half pin on the outside is left strong enough, whilst the spacing of the pins is regular and at a suitable angle. -In many cases when a drawer sticks it will be found that the place in which it slides, or ought to slide, is the part that requires most attention. -A drawer to run well must be perfectly parallel back and front all around, except that the sides and top and bottom may be eased off to the extent of 1/16 in. to }£ in. at the extreme ends, this easing off to extend to about y 2 in. from the end. For small drawers much less will be sufficient; large drawers may have a little more taken off. -The runners, that is, the wood against which the drawer slides in its receptacle, should not be quite parallel, but a little wider at the back, or the drawer will never run well. Here again it is impossible to give exact measurements. A drawer 1 ft. wide, 6 in. high, and 1 ft. 6 in. long would require the space at the back to be about % in. wider and higher than the front. -One great fault with drawers is that they \"wind,\" that is, if placed on a perfectly flat table, all four corners will not touch the level surface. This is most difficult to rectify. The cause may be bad workmanship or unseasoned wood which has twisted in drying. The high parts may be planed off, but then the drawer will be small, and must be made up to its proper size by gluing on strips of wood ; or the receptacle may be reduced in size. The latter is usually the easier to do. -Suppose that the top long drawer of the 4-ft. chest of drawers which has stuck half-way is to be rectified. Do not use too much force in pulling the handles, or they may come off, or the whole front come away from the sides. Unscrew the back from the carcase, and while a helper pulls at the handles, gently tap the ends at the back with a hammer, a piece of wood being interposed endwise of the grain to act as a punch. Take care to hit the end of the drawer that is farthest in. If this does not move the drawer, it may be necessary to remove the partition between the drawers by sliding it out, and then the runners at the sides of the carcase, by gently prising them out, first previousl yremoving the screws if necessary. -The drawer must be badly jammed if it still remains fixed, and removal to a warmer room had better be tried, and a little time allowed before resorting to stronger measures. -When the drawer is removed, first replace the partition and runners, and ascertain whether the latter are wider apart at the back than at the front. This is best done by cutting a strip of wood the exact length of the opening of the front, and sliding it to the back. If not, the runners must be reduced. Or it may happen that there is no runner, or that it has been forced out of place. -Having got the runners parallel, except for the little play mentioned, next see that they are straight from -back to front; the sides of the carcase may have bulged and bent them. Afterwards do the top and bottom in a similar way. Before and during the process of adjustment, see that the runners do not wind with the front. This can be ascertained by placing the eye about 3 in. from the front of the bottom rail on which the drawer slides and level with it, and observing that the runner ends are in the same plane, by looking first at one end and then the other without moving the eye. This requires practice, and is termed \"taking it out of wind.\" Repeat the process for the under side of the top rail, and adjust the runners as required. -Having got the carcase right, next examine the drawer itself for winding, and whether it is parallel and straight from back to front. If the sides bulge, they can sometimes be knocked in a little. If not, the surplus must be planed off, first making a pencil mark where the parts are not to be planed. -Now try the drawer to see if it will run in. If it goes half way, take off a little with a plane (or scraper if the wood is hard) where it is tight. Run it in and out several times, and see where it shines, and carefully remove the shine. Avoid taking any off the edge of the front as long as possible, or it will be too small and a bad fit. In shutting or opening a well-fitting drawer, a little friction should be felt for the whole length. -The sides and top and bottom edges should next be well smoothed with middle and fine sand paper until -they shine. Finally they and the runners should be rubbed with spermaceti wax, and then with a linen rag, using plenty of pressure. Spermaceti sometimes crumbles away when used. If so, melt it at a low heat in a jar, pour into a cardboard box, and keep it there, cutting down the edges as required. Nothing need be added when using on wood ; but for the joints of brass mathematical instruments, add 10 per cent of vaseline. -Veneering which we will first deal with, consists of laying an expensive or highly figured wood upon a foundation of a cheaper or more common wood. It does not always meet with approval, the prevailing idea being that if a piece of cabinet-work is veneered it is cheap; but a moment\\'s consideration would convince the most incredulous that the finest effects in the works are to be obtained only by this process. It is a fact also that veneering gives greater strength to articles of furniture than if they were solidly made. Among the valuable woods for the purpose many are obtained from the far East, even the remote Siam and the Philippines furnishing supplies. Some of the most exquisitely colored and figured woods are only obtainable in small pieces, and are used for ornamental inlay designs, in devising and applying which the Hollanders are so expert that cabinets, tables, desks and other articles thus treated by them are imported here and find ready sale. -The best figured and most ornamental wood is usually to be found at the butt end of the tree, though good mottle may be obtained at the junction of the trunk and limbs. In buying timber for veneering purposes, only long experience can determine its quality and worth ; the external appearance is not always a true index of the internal, and it is often a matter of chance, -\"Sawn.\" — This term is applied to all veneers that are cut by saw. The log is placed upon a travelling platform, the fine saws being set in a vertical frame and cutting the veneers simultaneously through the log. The usual number of veneers to the inch is ten, but, if desired, twelve may be obtained; the latter are, however, thin, and not so serviceable. The veneers are numbered consecutively, so that \"match\" veneers may easily be determined. The ends should be bound with muslin to prevent splitting. Veneers to be in proper workable order must be kept in a damp place; they are then much more pliable, and less liable to crack. The waste of timber in cutting by this method is, roughly speaking, about $i of an inch per inch of thickness. -\"Knife-cut.\" — By this method there is no waste whatever. The log, having been opened up, is steamed, and, while saturated with moisture, placed under the knife. This works horizontally, and takes off the thinnest shaving possible. The usual number of veneers obtained per inch of thickness is from thirty-six to forty ; they are therefore almost as thin as paper, and not at all reliable for hard wear or subsequent scraping and repolishing. Knife-cut veneers should only be used on -those parts of a job that are not liable to constant wear; the only advantage — and that a doubtful one — which they possess is that the veneer will \"lie\" more readily upon a sweep or on the flat owing to its thinness, and -with a reduction in time there is a corresponding abatement in price. Apart from economic reasons, a \"sawn\" veneer should always be used. -Veneering. — Any wood is suitable for veneering upon, but those usually selected are of the \"bay-wood\" or pines. The foundation, having been faced up, is \"toothed\" by a special hand plane, thus imparting a rough surface to the wood which will enable the glue to adhere more firmly. A solution of size and water used hot is next applied and allowed to dry. The heart side of a board should always be veneered upon, and the -reverse side damped with water to prevent the board going round when sized. Lay the board face down until ready for veneering. The veneer may now be laid, and can be done in two ways — by hand or machine. -For small works, mouldings, or sweeps, use the former method ; for panels, carcase ends, etc., the latter. -Process i. — Quickly brush over with hot glue, taking care to spread it evenly. The veneer may then be laid down, pressed by hand to remove the air, and squeezed down by means of a \"caul,\" removing all blisters and superfluous glue. A weighted board then should be placed on the job until the following day. -In the case of sweeps, either a steel bow-cramp contracted to the shape, or a wooden template secured by means of cramps, should be used. -this purpose is shown at Fig. 172 and comprises an iron framework with perforated cast top, a series of gasburners running at intervals of 9 inches or so the length of the machine, and over this an iron plate covered by a sheet of zinc. The gas having been turned on and the plate heated, the job to be veneered is laid on the machine, and cramps are then placed across and tightened down by means of set-screws, until the air between the foundation and the veneer is excluded, and -the superfluous glue squeezed out. This may be easily ascertained by a tap on the panel, a hollow sound indicating that the veneer is not bedded. When the veneer has been laid, turn off the gas and leave the job to cool naturally, say, through the night, the cramps remaining -on. After standing for three days, the work may be finished off. It will be found that some of the glue has oozed through the pores of the veneer, while a general roughness is apparent. Proceed with an ordinary iron scraper or iron plane to smooth down (the latter is better if the veneer is thick enough, as the scraper may get too warm and soften the glue beneath), and finish with sand-paper upon a cork rubber. The job is then ready for the polisher. -The butt-joint (Fig. 178) is a most effective way of veneering a drawerfront or panel. Take two \"match\" veneers — that is, consecutive members — as cut from the log, cut through each where it is desired to butt, thus -making them \"rights\" and \"lefts,\" the figure falling equally from the central joint. The veneer is then laid upon the foundation, and a few needle points or tacks placed on each side the joint, a strip of brown paper being glued upon the same to hold it in position. When dry, lay as before described. -Fig. 179. — A more elaborate way of panelveneering is to use four match veneers quartered. All the joints must be pasted. -Fig. 180. — Still more elaborate is the addition of cross-banding, which is laid by hand after the center is completed. -Fig. 181. — The addition of a stringing is often advantageous to break the line of junction and throw up the center, a narrow band of the veneer being removed for this purpose by means of a cutting gauge. -Fig. 182. — If there is a defect or hole in a veneer, a new piece should be inserted matching the curl or mottle of the wood, the edges of which should be cut to the shape of the curl or follow the line of the grain. If this is done, detection is almost impossible; on no account insert a square piece, as the hard lines thus produced are most objectionable. -This most important branch of the wood-working trade seldom gets the attention it deserves, the common idea being that there is nothing in polishing demanding skill or judgment, or even worth the trouble of knowing. No greater mistake than this could be made. Polishers have in their hands the making or marring of the finished piece of furniture from the cabinet-maker\\'s bench. Briefly, the process of Frenchpolishing consists in the application of various gums, lacs, etc., dissolved in spirit, in order to give to the wood a surface or polish (bright or dull as required) which not only preserves the wood, but brings out the beauty of the grain. -Workshop and Fittings. — The workshop should be a large well-ventilated building, with a north light for preference and also top lights. It should be kept heated to a given temperature, say 60 degrees F , and be maintained at this heat night and day. Hot-water pipes around the walls, with regulating valves, will probably give the best results; steam-pipes may be used, but do not maintain such an equable temperature. A small enclosed coke-stove or gas-burner is an essential for the purpose of melting wax, obtaining hot water, etc. -The room should be free from dust, as any particles floating in the air and settling on a job in process, are bound to be worked up into it, producing a cloudy ef-feet. There should also be a smaller room leading from the main shop for \"Fumigating;\" this must be air-tight, and have a pane of glass inserted in one of the upper panels of the door for observation purposes. -Trestles are required varying in height from 9 inches to 30 inches, and loose tops of different lengths and widths for placing on them. Several wooden battens covered with felt to protect a job are also necessary. -Materials. — It need hardly be said that upon the quality of the materials used in polishing depends very largely the ultimate results, good or bad. And here, as in other branches of trade, the best is always the cheapest. It will be found a mistake to lay in too much stock, as polish quickly evaporates and other materials deteriorate, but rather to buy small quantities of lac, spirit, &c, and mix fresh as required. -Not much in the way of plant is needed to fit a polishing shop : — say, half a dozen pint (and a few larger) stoppered bottles for polish, glaze, finish, varnish, &c. ; a few jars of stain, oil, fillers; and tin canisters for keeping rubbers, more valued by the polisher than any part of his kit. -How to make a rubber. — Get a piece of clean white or gray wadding, remove the skin from it, and roll it into an Qgg shape, then cover the same with a thin linen rag strained tightly over the wadding, holding the ends in the palm of the hand, the two forefingers and thumb bedding themselves on the extremity of the rubber, flat-ten the under side or polishing surface, and you will have an oval flat of, say, 3 by 2 inches. The proper size of the rubber depends upon the polisher himself and the class of work engaged on. -If new linen or calico prints be used, they should be washed to remove all trace of lime or dressing, and be as soft and pliable as possible. A different rubber should be used for different polishes, and they are so easy and inexpensive to make, there is no reason why work should be clouded through dirty rubbers. Cleanliness and good polishing go hand in hand. When the rubber is finished with, it should be kept in an air-tight canister. It will thus keep soft, and may be used repeatedly. Failure to do this will result in hardness, which renders it useless. We are now ready to commence work and proceed to the first page, viz : — -Filling-in. — This consists of coating the surface of the wood with a filler, which closes or fills up the grain, thus making it possible to get a perfectly smooth surface for polishing and also saving time and material in the afterwork. Upon the efficiency of the filling-in depends the result of the finished job. There are many good fillers on the market, any one of which might be equally well adopted, but it is much better that the polisher should make his own polishes, &c, and many men prefer to do so. Consequently no two polishers use exactly the same formula, but work upon receipts best adapted to their own particular style. Before filling-in, the work -should be as finely papered down as possible. Too much stress cannot be laid on this point, for if well done at first much after-labor will be saved. The filler can then be put on with a flannel, and rubbed into the grain of the wood until the pores are filled up, then wipe all off and paper down. This will be found necessary, because the filler will have raised the grain. When dry, the work will be ready for the next process, bodying-up. -The following fillers will be found useful. The exact proportions can be ascertained when mixing, remembering that the filler must just be of the consistency to work freely. -Fillers. — (i) Spirit varnish laid on with a brush; this forms a good quick filler. Two coats should be given. -(2) Size. — Ordinary glue size may be used as a filler in the case of hard-grained wood, and will answer the purpose. -(4) Whiting and Linseed-oil. — Mix these together into a paste and apply with a flannel. This is a filler generally adopted. -The disadvantage in Nos. 3 and 4 is that there is a great liability to get the job greasy, which will afterwards work its way through the polish, giving the surface a cobweb effect which is known as \"sweating.\" -and apply to the job, and rub off as quickly as possible. This filler is undoubtedly the cleanest and most effectual that can be used, and entirely obviates \"sweating.\" -(6) Whiting and Turpentine. — Mix into a paste, and apply as before. This is preferred by many to No. 5. -Thus far these fillers are in the white, and suitable only for such woods as ash, maple, satinwood, birch, &c. In the case of dark-colored woods the filler should be tinted with rose-pink or Venetian red ; ebonized work, lamp-black; oak, walnut woods, &c, chromes, ochres, and umbers according to the tone required. -Bodying-up. — We now come to the second stage of polishing. The wood having been papered down with fine old glass paper, take a rubber, previously described, and sprinkle a little polish onto it from the stock bottle ; then cover over with a rag, holding the ends tightly in the palm of the hand, and tap the rubber against the palm of the other hand, which will cause the polish to distribute itself over the whole rubber; put a spot of linseed-oil on with the finger, and the rubber is ready for work. Commence very lightly at one corner of the work, if it be a panel or carcase end, and by a series of motions forming interlacing curves, gradually work over the entire surface, never lifting the rubber until at the edge of the job. Care must be taken not to have the rubber too full of polish, or to press on the work too hard, in which case the polish will ooze out of the rubber and leave nasty ridges on the job ; the idea is how -best to cover the entire work evenly. Having done this, let the job stand as long as possible — a few days will do no harm, — -the shellac will then have sunk into the wood, the spirit evaporating. This will present a dull appearance, and feel rough to the touch. We then proceed to paper down again, in fact too much stress cannot be placed upon the value of judicious sand-papering. After this the operation is repeated until a good body of polish is obtained on the work. Be very sparing of using oil; though this eases the rubber, it ruins the \\'job ultimately. After another papering or pumice-stoning down we can pass to the final stage, spiriting-off. It may be asked, how many times is it necessary to go over the work ? This very much depends on the wood worked upon. It will be anything from three to six times, the object being to obtain a body, hard and that will not sink. Much of the modern work is completely ruined to-day because it is \"rushed.\" Time is not allowed between the rubbers, consequently no proper foundation is obtained, and in six months\\' time the job requires redoing. The method described above will apply equally to either light, or dark woods, the difference being in the polish used rather than the method. Spiriting-off. — This process may be called the most difficult portion of French-polishing, and when once proficient in this a man may be said to know his trade. The process is similar to bodying-up, with this exception, that towards the last \"spirits\" only are used on -the rubber. This has the effect of polishing the \"lac\" put on during bodying-up, and giving to the work a fine, hard, bright surface ; the oil previously worked in is spirited out. -Commence by using, say, two parts of polish to one of spirit, then equal parts, afterwards two of spirit to one of polish, and thus gradually reducing the polish to nil, and using only pure spirit. The rubber and motions are as previously described. A clean rubber should be used when pure spirit only is used, and a series of straight motions taken instead of the circular ones, running the same direction as the grain of the wood. -Small mouldings, angles, awkward corners, &c, which would be very difficult to spirit off in the ordinary way, may be done by \"glazing.\" Applied with a rubber and worked straight along the moulds, this glaze quickly dries, and has the same appearance as if spirited-off. It is, however, softer, and will not stand wear. Much of this work could be obviated if the polisher were given the job in pieces; for instance, mouldings mitred around panels should be polished in long lengths, and cut and fitted afterwards, thus avoiding nasty corners. Turned work is better polished in the lathe, before being framed up. Panels should be polished before framing up, or if beaded in, left loose for that purpose. -difficulty in mixing polishes, and every man should be able to do so, the process simply consisting in dissolving shellac in methylated spirit. This latter should be bought at 60 over-proof, stored in a cool place, and tightly sealed, as it soon evaporates. -Shellac is orange in color; the lighter the color the purer the quality. It is in small flakes, and requires crushing before dissolving in the spirits. This would be used for ordinary polish. If, however, a clear or white polish is desired, then bleached shellac is used. This is in lumps, and must be crushed before using. This lac must be kept in water. Coloring pigments can be added to any polish to intensify it as desired, such as Bismarck or Vandyke brown. These polishes should be mixed cold — the shellac will take a little longer to dissolve, but the operation is much safer, — then strain through muslin, and put in stoppered bottles. -Brown Polish. — (1) 1 pint methylated spirit, 4 oz. orange shellac, Yi oz. sandarac; or (3) 1 pint methylated spirit, 4 oz. orange shellac, y 2 oz. sandarac, 94 oz. benzoin. -Glaze. — 1 pint methylated spirits, 6 oz. benzoin, Yi oz. of sandarac can be added for harding purposes. -preparations which are used to restore furniture which has already been polished, but has through neglect or other cause become cloudy. The first thing to be done in a case of this kind is to thoroughly wash the woodwork with a flannel soaped with curd soap and warm water; by this means all dirt and grease will be removed. After wiping down with a soft dry duster, apply one or other of the following revivers, and polish off with another clean duster. Much of the old polish will thus be brought back. -Reviver No. i. — Take equal parts of methylated spirit, linseed-oil, and malt vinegar. Mix well and shake before using. -Reviver No. 2. — Turpentine, 1 quart ; bees\\'-wax, V\\\\ lb. ; curd soap, 2 oz. ; water, 1 quart. Dissolve the bees\\'wax in the turpentine by moderate heat ; shred the curd soap in the water and boil ; then while both are hot mix together. This will set in a light paste, and prove an excellent polisher. -Repairs. — When a bruise has to be made good upon a job the best plan to adopt is as follows : — Raise the bruise by means of a hot iron placed upon a damp cloth. This, unless the wood is broken, will lift it to its original level, it may then be sand-papered off and polished. -Bleaching. — It sometimes happens that some parts of the wood are darker than the rest, in which event it is most important that the darker parts be reduced to -the lighter. This result is produced by bleaching. Dissolve i oz. of oxalic acid in half a pint of water, and apply with a rag; when dry, paper down, and if the density is not sufficiently reduced, repeat the operation until the desired result is obtained. -Sweating-out. — When too much oil has been used on the job, the surface presents a cobweb appearance which gradually increases and eats the polish away. When first detected, it may be removed with warm water, soap, and flannel; but when of long standing, nothing can be done to remove it except repolishing. -This is the process of treating oak with ammonia, darkening it by this means to any required shade. This result can be achieved in two ways. -(1st.) Natural fumigation, that is, exposing the oak work in a sealed chamber to the fumes of ammonia until the required density is obtained. -The ammonia used should be a solution of ammonia gas in water, and should have a specific gravity of 880. This must, on account of its volatile nature, be kept in a well-stoppered bottle. -Process 1. — To fumigate by this means a separate chamber is required. This may be an ordinary room or a fuming-cabinet built in the corner of the polishing shop. In either case it must be air-tight, and the door opening into it should have a square of glass for observation purposes. When the oak work has been placed within it, take, say 1 pint of ammonia and fill about a dozen saucers placed upon the floor. The door must then be closed, and sealed up by means of brown paper pasted round the joints. The process of fuming then begins, and can be watched through the glass until the desired shade is obtained. The smaller the chamber the quicker will the work be done; the time may vary from six to twelve hours according to the strength -of the ammoniated atmosphere. Practice alone will determine the time for opening the chamber. This is the only reliable and safe way of fumigating; in fact all other processes are but imitations of it, and the product of \"cheapness and rush.\" -The advantages of this process are : ( i ) that as no liquid touches the job the grain is not raised, consequently sand-papering is avoided; (2) the ammonia fumes penetrate deeper into the wood than by outward application; (3) the exact density can be more easily determined. -The disadvantages are : ( 1 ) This process requires a separate room for the purpose; (2) It takes much more time than is required by the direct application of ammonia. -In connection with natural fuming it will be noticed that some parts of the job may not \"take\" at all. This often arises from the fact that various oaks have been used in its construction. Thus \"Oak grown in one part of America may be susceptible to the fumes, while oak grown in another state, will not.\" Those parts which have not \"taken\" must then be treated by Process 2, and care must be exercised that the resultant color may be the same. Let the ammonia for this purpose be very weak. Let it dry before applying another coat (if necessary), as it is much easier to intensify than to bleach, and nothing looks worse than a patchy job. -Process 2. — This consists in the application of liquid ammonia (.880 spec, grav.) direct on to the work. It is usually applied with a sponge or rag. Water may be added to weaken the solution if only a light tint is desired. The wood immediately darkens upon the surface, but allowances should be made for its drying lighter. The objection to this process is that it raises the grain, which entails sand-papering down, while process No. 1 does not. This necessarily takes away much of the sharpness of the mouldings, the fillets suffering most of all. In this case it will be found that the work does not take the dye evenly, and the same shading or toning to a color will be found necessary to produce a good result. -In either process the job should be in the white, that is, without brass or copper work or silvered plates, as these are liable to be affected by the ammonia fumes. -Finishing. — The work, having been fumed by either of the foregoing processes, is now ready for finishing, and the usual way is either of the following: — (1) Egg-shell finish ; (2) Wax finish. -(1) Apply a thin rubber of ordinary polish to the job, and dull down with powdered pumice-stone and a stiff brush. This will give a dull shine without in any way filling the grain of the wood. (2) Dissolve pure bees\\'-wax in turpentine, and apply with a rag, rubbing well in, and obtaining a polish by \"elbow grease.\" This is a more tedious process than the former, but much -more satisfactory, as this process can be carried on after the job has left the polisher\\'s hands and the polish will constantly improve. -Mahogany is the only other wood that will \"fume.\" It assumes a purple tint, and should be treated in the same manner as oak. -This method of producing a polish was undoubtedly the earliest adopted by cabinetmakers, and is best suited to the finishing of dark oak, chestnut, and some other woods. The advantage appears to consist in the fact that the process is never complete, and, like Tennyson\\'s \"Brook,\" may go on forever. Much of the beauty of a piece of sixteenth-century carved oak is due to the polishing, — the result of years of rubbing — by use. -In wax-polishing two ingredients only are necessary, bees\\'-wax and turpentine. The wax should be melted, and sufficient turpentine added to form an easy workable paste ; do not heat the turpentine or pour it into the melted wax while the latter is still on the fire, as it is highly inflammable. As all the turpentine must evaporate before the polishing is complete — leaving the wax to act as both filler and polisher, — no more should be added at the commencement than necessary, otherwise the work will be prolonged. If the stock sets hard it can be softened again by warming, but it is better to mix it in small quantities as required. The safest method of warming or melting all ingredients in the polish-shop is by steam, using a kettle or double pan, such as the cabinet-makers use for glue. This point is one not lost sight of by insurance companies. -In applying the wax-polish no skill is required, but \"elbow-grease\\'\\' and patience are absolutely necessary. -We will suppose that we are polishing an oak wainscoting, which has been previously fumed and stained. If the latter, we shall rub down with ^sand-paper; if the former, this will be unnecessary. By means of a flannel boss we apply the wax-polish, rubbing the panels in circular motion till every part receives an equal polish. The work may now with advantage be laid aside until the next day, when the process may be repeated. Let \"a little and often\" be the motto, — a little, in order that no clogging of wax occurs in the corners and mouldings, all the wax being rubbed in until an even bright surface is obtained, free from all tackiness or finger marking ; and often, so that each thin coat may have a chance to sink into the grain and by the evaporation of the turpentine harden. Remember that the polish is produced not by the amount of wax used but by \"elbow-grease.\" -If preferred, a piece of felt glued to a wooden block may be used ; a stiff flat bristle brush is often used for polishing a carved panel or turned work. -Thus far we have spoken of wax-polishing as applied to oak, and it is questionable whether it can be applied with equal success to other woods ; stained ash is perhaps the next best wood to oak for this method of polishing. -Floors are often treated in this way, including parquet surrounds, plain stained surrounds, or entire floors. Hard-wood floors are usually without previous -staining, as each polishing darkens the floor until a rich tone results. The method is as previously described, except that for floors a box-polisher is used, which is weighted. This is a wooden case (say) 12x8x6 inches, weighted inside with iron or lead to 14 lbs, ; attached to this is a handle 6 feet long, working on a swivel, and thus allowing a sweep of 6 feet or so in each direction, in other words a clear swing of 12 feet or more. Upon the bottom of this case tack a piece of clean felt and proceed to polish. -The wax must previously have been rubbed on the floor with a flannel, and the first part of the polishing done with a weighted brush having a surface of 12x8 inches, and fitted with a swinging handle. This will evenly spread the wax and take up all superfluous quantities; it will also produce a certain amount of polish which can afterwards be brought up to a great brilliancy by the finishing felt polisher. This method would also be used in preparing the floor of a ballroom, which might afterwards be kept in condition by the sprinkling and rubbing-in of French chalk. -If wax polishing was the original method of treating oak, it may be said with equal truth that oil-polishing was the method of finishing mahogany in. the days when French-polishing was unknown; in fact, it is questionable whether any of the seventeenth and eighteenth-century work was dealt with in any other manner. Chippendale, Sheraton, and their contemporaries certainly adopted it as best suited to their work, and the untouched jobs handed down prove their decision to have been right. -The great objection to oil-polishing is the length of time required to produce a good result; in fact, the longer you go on, the better it is. This fact has in these days of speed completely put oil-polishing in the background; the manufacturer wants a speedy return for his capital, and the public require their furniture the day after they give the order, so that it is impossible to have a job in the polisher\\'s hands a month, and speedier methods have consequently been adopted. -It is unquestionable that oil-polishing will bring up the figure of mahogany and enrich its color better than any other method, and if time permits, it is, for large work (such as panelling, dadoes, doors, screens, counter tops, &c), the very best way of polishing. -upon the wood with raw linseed-oil, this being continually rubbed in with a flannel or felt pad. Let the operation be repeated day by day until a polish results. The process is, like wax-polishing, extremely tedious and laborious. Oil-polish can always be revived years afterwards by the same process, and a little judicious rubbing will keep the work constantly up to the mark. -The rage for effect at low cost has necessitated the staining of white woods to imitate the more expensive ones, and the bulk of the so-called walnut or dark mahogany fittings are but the product of the polisher who, with dexterous hand, produces the required deception. The woods commonly used for stained work are birch, canary wood, yellow pine, and other woods. -Stains should be placed on the wood direct before any size or filling has been applied. They may be applied in warm or cold water, diluted to their proper strength. A sponge is the best medium, and care should be taken that the stain floods the wood equally. When dry, the work should be sand-papered carefully — as the wet stain raises the grain — and a smooth surface obtained, then proceed with the finishing off as previously described. Aniline dyes are much used, and can be obtained in any shade in addition to the following. Let the stain be weak ; it is easier to apply a second coat than lighten the first. -Walnut. — (i) Vandyke brown, J4 lb.; ammonia .880, 1 pint; water, 1 quart; (2) bichromate of potash, 4 oz. ; water, 1 quart. -Apply the stain to the wood with a sponge or rag, rubbing over the work until an even surface is obtained. Allow the stain to dry (which will raise the grain) then paper down, and proceed to finish by varnishing. This may be done in either oil or spirit, but the process is the same, except that for oil varnish a bristle brush may be used, while for spirit a camelhair brush is desirable. After the first coat by either method, the work should be rubbed down before a second or finishing coat is applied. If an extra fine surface is required, paper down again after the second coat, and apply a third. Oil varnish would be used for such work as would be exposed to the weather, spirit varnish for indoor or protected woodwork. -Spirit Varnish. — 1 lb. orange shellac, 6 oz. sandarac, 2 oz. hard resin, and 2 quarts meth. spirit. -Clear Spirit Varnish. — 8 oz. sandarac, 1 quart meth. spirit, }i pint of turpentine; this should stand and be strained through muslin to take out all sediment. -Spirit Varnish. — 1 / 2 lb. orange shellac, 1 oz. resin, 1 oz. sandarac, and 1 pint meth. spirit ; this makes a hard, quick-setting varnish. -In No. i, Fig. 183, is an illustration of a completed revolving book-case of the ordinary type. It stands 3 or 4 feet high, and is about 20 inches square. A plan of the base on which the book-case revolves is shown on No. 2. This is made of two pieces of wood 2^2 inches wide and i l /> inches thick. These are joined together by halving, and have rounded ends. Four castors are fixed at the base, one near each corner. The top is made of i l / 2 inch boards doweled together, and the edge moulded and a rebate cut on the under side. The top may also be made of a 3/2-inch board with a ij^-inch moulding fitted round the edge, and another J^-inch board fastened below, thus saving material and effecting lightness. No. 3 is a section of the book-case showing the details of construction of the top and bottom and the method of attaching the revolving part to the base, A being the top, B F and B F two of the laths which keep the books in position, and H the fixed base (shown in No. 2). The base of the revolving part is made of 1 ^2 -inch boards, C, which have a rebate cut round the lower edge to receive the i-inch plinth, D D, which is mitred at the corners and fastened into the rebate. The lower edge of the plinth is rebated and a thin board, E, fixed into it. -No. 4 is a perspective view of the frame to which the shelves are fastened. It is made of four boards of equal -width and thickness joined by grooves and overlapping so that a square tube is formed. These boards must be of such a width that, when fastened in their places, the -width of the frame is the same as that of the base, C (No. 3). The middle part of the frame should be i 1 /* inch longer than the rest, and fit into the center of C. Another way of fastening the shelves, which requires less material, is to make a square tube, and attach the shelves to this. . Strips of wood 2 or 3 inches wide are fastened along the top and bottom of each shelf in the -position in which the boards (No. 4) would come. These strips keep the books in position at one end of each row, and the laths (B F and B F, No. 3) at the other end. -The method of pivoting the revolving part is shown in No. 3. A circular pillar, I, is turned to fit the interior of the square tube,, and the lower end is turned down to form a pivot which fits the hole in the fixed base, H ; a little above the pivot a groove is cut in the pillar, forming a neck which works in a hole cut in a piece of i-inch board, G, which is attached to the -under side of C. This piece of wood is sawn in half, the two halves placed in position on the pillar, and then glued together again. The pillar extends to within about i foot of the top of the tube. A steel spindle, K, with a pointed top is screwed into the upper end, and -Fig. 183 this spindle pivots in the under side of a metal plate, L, which is attached to a block of wood, M. The latter should exactly fit the tube, and is attached to it by screws. -The revolving apparatus can also be made by fastening two or more castors or wheels to the lower side of the base. These castors roll over a metal plate fastened to the upper side of the fixed base. The latter is attached to the revolving part by a spindle, which passes through the frame and the base, and is secured by nuts. -When the top and bottom has been attached to the tube, and the shelves are in their places, the laths B F and B F (No. 3) are attached to the shelves, and also -essentially the same. Sometimes the revolving part is made shorter, and legs added to the fixed base. They are also made to contain only one tier of books, so that they can stand on the table. Fixed book-stands are also made with shelves arranged similarly to the revolving book-cases. -Chairs. — Although chairs have an infinite variety of form, as we have shown, they are constructed on nearly the same principles. No. i, Fig. 184, is an illustration of the framework of a chair suitable for a sitting-room. The hind part consists of two long pieces of squared stuff, to which are mortised two horizontal upper rails forming the back, a third at the level of the seat, and a fourth below. These back legs are usually curved backwards above and below the seat, so that the chairback has a slight slope and so that the feet are spread out sufficiently to prevent tilting. The front legs are joined by two rails, and are also fastened to the back by the same number. The tenons of the upper rails may come up. flush with the top of the leg, as shown in the illustration, or can be fitted into an ordinary mortise. The width of the rails at the level of the seat depends upon the nature of the upholstery; if springs are to be fitted, they are about three inches wide. The bottom rails are omitted in some chairs of heavy build, or the side pairs of legs are connected by rails and the middle of these joined by a cross-piece. -All the parts of bedroom chairs, with the exception of the backs, are, as a rule, turned. The two back legs project above the seat to form the back, and are joined by two horizontal bars, which are slightly curved and joined to the vertical pieces by shallow mortises cut -in the latter. The joint is further strengthened by screws passed from the front through counter-sunk holes, -the heads being afterwards covered by small turned beads glued in, or if the chair is to be painted, the holes can be filled with wooden plugs. The lower rails are turned, and their rounded ends fit into corresponding -holes bored in the legs, where they are secured by glue. Sometimes only the front legs are turned, the back legs -Figure 184a being left square and bent slightly outwards. The seats of such chairs are made of four flat pieces of wood -about I inch thick mortised together, the front and back pieces overlapping the other two, and the back piece being shorter than that at the front. The corners and edges are slightly rounded, and sometimes the front piece is curved, as are also the sides. The front legs fit into the holes bored in the under side of the seat, and the back legs are fitted to the seat by grooves y 2 inch deep cut in the former. Rounded backs are made by cutting the upper ends of the back legs to form part of a circle, and fitting across these a curved piece of wood. This is attached by mortise-and-tenon joints, or by dowels. The lower cross-bar is cut in a similar manner, so that, when the four are joined together, the back has the form of a segment of a circle or ellipse. -Drawing-room chairs are framed in a somewhat similar manner. Turned or fretted bars are sometimes inserted in the back, either horizontally or vertically, or part of the back is upholstered. The legs are squared, tapered, and slightly curved ; or they are also turned and fluted, or left plain and carved. -No. 2, Fig. 184, shows the frame work of an armchair. The only difference between this and No. 1 is that the back is higher, the seat larger, and four extra rails forming the arms are added. The latter may be upholstered, or not, according to the design of the chair; turned spindles are sometimes inserted between them and the seat. The back of the arm-chair is sometimes slightly curved, and the seat may be made -oak, the legs being square and tapering, the side and back rails flat, and the latter slightly curved. The wood may be darkened with ammonia, or stained darkgreen, and the seat upholstered in leather. The backs of chairs of this type are not upholstered, but are generally made with top and bottom rails, the intermediate -In office chairs and others of a similar type the four legs are mortised to the wooden seat, which is made slightly hollow towards the middle part. The curved back is made up of several pieces, which are cut to form a curve and mortised or doweled together. It is attached to the seat by a series of turned or square vertical bars fixed by mortises, the two at the ends in front being stouter than the others. An extra piece of curved wood with a rounded edge is sometimes fixed to the middle part of the top of the back to serve as a shoulder-rest. When the seat is made to swivel round, the legs bend inwards, and meet at a small block of wood faced with metal, upon which the seat revolves. Office chairs are sometimes slightly upholstered instead of being left altogether plain. -The framework of an easy-chair is almost the same as that of an arm-chair, but the side rails which support the seat are much wider, the legs are shorter and thicker, and the seat stretches farther back. The back is not so high, and is made to slope slightly. The space between the arms and seat may be left open, filled with carved or turned work, or covered with upholstery. Some settees are made after the manner of large easy-chairs, wide enough to contain two or three persons; the framework of such is the same, but the seat and back are strengthened by additional crosspieces. -Music Stools. — These are made either with a fixed top, or with a top that can be raised. The former have four legs and the top is round or square. The legs sometimes slope slightly outwards towards the feet to obtain greater stability. In the plainer kind of stool, -y 2 -\\'mch boards with moulded edges, and of round, square, or oblong shape. If round, it is turned on the lathe out of one piece. If it is to be upholstered, a ^-inch rebate is cut all round, and the upholstery is fastened to it with brass-headed nails and finished off with gimp. The legs are either square or turned, and are screwed into the under side -of the seat ; they are strengthened near the lower ends by turned cross-rails. The coarse screws cut at the top of the legs are not turned on the lathe when they are being shaped, but are made subsequently with the aid of a \"box-screw.\" This is a rectangular block of wood with a handle at either end, and pierced by a hole in which a female screw corresponding to the male screw is cut. The top end of the leg is turned down for about Ij4 or 2 inches till it fits into one end of the hole, when it is pushed in and turned round at the same time, the screw being cut by a small knife inside. This method of joining legs is only used for light pieces of furniture and fancy tables, the legs beingusually attached by mortise-and-tenon joints. -Stools with movable seats have a stout turned pillar to with three curved feet are fastened by mortise-andtenon joints, meeting it about 6 inches from the ground. The top of the pillar is cut off flat and a hole 9 inches deep bored down it. A steel female screw is fixed into this, and a corresponding male screw about 9 inches long is fastened to the under side of the top. The latter is always circular and upholstered. -Sofas and Settees. — The framework of a sofa is shown in No. 1, Fig. 185. The four legs, which are represented simply as square blocks of wood, are fitted to the front and back rails with mortise-and-tenon joints. The upper part where the mortises are cut is generally made pretty stout to ensure strength, and -any resulting clumsiness is concealed by the upholstery. The lower part is tapered, carved, or turned. The front and back rails are strengthened by an additional crosspiece placed midway, and a similar cross-piece is fitted to the back, which is otherwise similar to the arm of an easy-chair. A method of fastening the head of the sofa is shown in the illustration; it consists of two rails mortised to the front and back legs in a slanting position, and strengthened by two cross-pieces. These rails are generally carved, and the front edges of both moulded. The outside of the front rail may also be carved. The top rail of the back is sometimes curved downwards until it meets the back rail of the lower frame, being made of two or more pieces mortised or doweled together. The space between the two is sometimes rilled with turned bars. In order to obtain lightness, each pair of legs is sometimes joined by two slight rails placed 2 or 3 inches apart instead of by a solid rail. -The framework of the simple square settee is shown in No. 2, Fig. 185. As all the woodwork of this is usually hidden by upholstery which reaches nearly down to the floor, it is made of common wood and receives no high degree of finish. The four legs are turned at the lower end and left square at the upper. The four rails which form the seat are mortised into the sides of the legs, as are also the three rails which form the back and ends. -The back can be further strengthened, if necessary, by inserting two diagonal bars. These settees are made in a great variety of forms, from that above described to the lighter and more elegant pieces of furniture which are embellished with turned work and only partly upholstered. Sometimes the four legs which form the end-pieces are turned and the seat-frame inserted in notches cut in these, and so upholstered that the lower part of the latter and all the legs are visible. -Settees for billiard-rooms are framed similarly to arm-chairs (see No. 2, Fig. 184). They are generally made about 6 or 7 feet long, and either straight or bent to suit corners. The woodwork of a billiard-room settee is shown in Fig. 186. The parts are more massive than those of ordinary settees. The legs are made of 3-in. scantling, those at the front being turned, whilst the other pair are bent slightly backwards. The settee stands on a platform about 8 inches high, and of such and sides. The two front corners of the platform are slightly rounded. When the settee is not intended to be placed on a platform, the legs are made longer and a foot-rest is fastened to the front about 6 inches from the floor. This is made of i-inch stuff with rounded edges ; it is fastened at the back into grooves cut in the front legs, and in front is supported on stout turned feet. -Seats for railway-stations, waiting-rooms, public offices, &c, are made in the same manner as billiard-or settle in darkened oak, suitable for a hall. The sides are made of ij/2 or 2-inch stuff, and grooves are cut in them to receive the seat, which is the same thickness. The seat is y 2 inch less in width than the sides, and comes up flush at the front, thus leaving a space Yi inch wide for the back. It may be attached to the sides by cutting at each end a rounded tenon 2 inches wide. These tenons project about ij^ inch through mortises cut in the end-pieces. Half-round holes are cut through these projecting pieces so that they are flush with the sides. When the seat is in its place, a peg made by cutting a piece of tapering turned wood in a longitudinal -direction is hammered in tight. This is shown in the illustration, and holds the sides and seat firmly together. To form the back, two horizontal rails are dovetailed to the sides, one at the bottom and the other at the top. The inner edges of these are grooved to fit a series of vertical boards, which are J^ inch thick and chamfered at the edges. The top edge of the settle is moulded or left square. -Some settles are made five or six feet high. The back of these is upholstered for about 3 feet above the seat, and the remainder of the space is filled with solid or fretted panels. A narrow shelf for china, &c, is sometimes fixed near the top. -Settles (No. 2, Fig. 187) are sometimes made of only two end-pieces and a seat. The former are made of 1 y* -inch oak, cut to any suitable shape. Settles of this kind serve as seats or for holding large pieces of china. -Another kind of settle which is very suitable for halls, has a seat 4 or 5 feet wide, and arms at the ends. The lower part forms a box, and is 1 foot deep, the lid being the seat. The sides and back are similar to those of an arm-chair. The four legs are usually of 2-inch scantling; the two back legs project above the seat and are joined by two horizontal i-inch rails, one at the top and the other nearly at the level of the seat. Two rails, which are fitted with panels, join each pair of legs and form the sides of the box. Panels of ^ -inch stuff are grooved to these. The framing of the lid is formed of -i-inch stuff, and is 2 or 3 inches wide. This kind of settle may be left plain, or finished with flat or chip carving. -Settles which are intended for drawing-rooms are similar in structural details to those made for the hall, but they are much lighter, and the greater part of the back and sides is upholstered. Many are fitted with a narrow shelf at the top, and the back is curved instead of being square. -Staining is the process of imparting to the surface of wood a color different from its natural one. It consists of two varieties, surface-staining and body-staining. In the former, as the name implies, the staining is effected by various compounds in the nature of pigments, laid upon the surface like paint, and forming a thin opaque coating, which does not, to any considerable degree, affect the fibre of the wood. In the latter the changes are chemical, the stain being usually applied as a thin wash, which, entering the pores of the wood, colors it to some depth below the surface. Staining requires no preliminary preparation, the stain being applied directly to the wood. As most stains raise the grain of the wood to a considerable extent, it is necessary before applying the varnish, to sand-paper the wood enough to render the grain quite smooth; this sometimes renders a second coat necessary, after which the sand-paper must be again applied. -A Good Black Stain. — I. Gall-nuts coarsely broken, 2 ounces; rain water, i quart; boil until reduced onehalf. 2. White vinegar, I pint ; iron filings, 2 ounces ; antimony (powdered) 2 ounces; vitriol, i ounce; logwood, a small handful. Infuse in bottle eight days, tying the cork down. To stain a piece of wood, give the wood a coating of No. i, which acts as a mordant; -Another. — Boil y 2 lb. of chip logwood in 2 quarts of water, add 1 oz. of pearl-ash, and apply it hot to the work with a brush; then take y> lb. of logwood, boil it as before in 2 quarts of water, and add y 2 oz. of verdigris and y 2 oz. of copperas; strain it off, put in y 2 lb. of rusty steel filings, and with this go over the work a second time. -Another. — Boil the extract of logwood in water, and to it add slowly a little of the yellow prussiate of potash. Brush on hot. -Another. — Boil 1 lb. logwood in 4 quarts of water; add a double handful of walnut-peel or shells, boil it up again, take out the chips, add a pint of the best vinegar and it will be fit for use ; apply hot. This will be improved by applying over the first stain a solution of one ounce of green copperas in a quart of water. -Other Black Stains. — 1. Drop a little sulphuric acid into a small quantity of water; brush over the wood and hold it to the fire ; it will be a fine black and receive a good polish. 2. For a beautiful black, on wood, nothing can exceed black japan. Apply two coats; after which, varnish and polish it. 3. To 1 gallon vinegar, add a quarter of a pound of iron rust; let it stand for a week ; then add a pound of dry lamp-black, and three-quarters of a pound copperas; stir it up for a couple of days. Lay on five or six coats with a sponge, -allowing it to dry between each ; polish with linseed oil and a soft woollen rag, and it will look like ebony. 4. Vinegar, y 2 gal. ; dry lamp-black, y 2 lb. ; iron rust sifted, 3 lbs. ; mix and let stand for a week. Lay three coats of this on hot, and then rub with linseed oil, and you will have a fine deep black. 5. Add to the above stain nut-galls, 1 oz. ; logwood chips, y 2 lb. ; copperas, J4 lb. ; lay on three coats ; oil well, and you will have a black stain that will stand any kind of weather, and is well adapted for ships\\' combings, etc. 6. Logwood chips, y 2 lb.; Brazil-wood, % lb.; boil for 1^2 hours in 1 gallon water. Brush the wood with this decoction while hot; make a decoction of nut-galls, by gentle simmering for three or four days, a quarter of a pound of the galls in 3 qts. water ; give the wood three coats, and, while wet, lay on a solution of sulphate of iron (2 ozs. to a quart), and, when dry, oil or varnish. 7. Give three coats with a solution of copper filings in aquafortis, and repeatedly brush over with the logwood decoction until the greenness of the copper is destroyed. 8. Boil y 2 lb. logwood chips in 2 quarts water ; add an ounce of pearlash, and apply hot with a brush. Then take 2 quarts of the logwood decoction, and y 2 oz. of verdigris, and the same of copperas; strain, and throw in y 2 lb. of iron rust. Brush the work well with this, and oil. -Brown Stain. — Boil 1 lb. of the brown pigment called Terre de Cassel with 4 quarts of water, until it is re-duced one-third. Mix two ounces (Troy) of white potash with sufficient water to dissolve it, and mix with the Terre de Cassel. This stain must be applied with a brush, two or even three times, according to the depth of the shade required. -Walnut Stain. — Mix together, by stirring, i quart spirits of turpentine, I pint asphaltum varnish, i pint of japan, i lb. dry burnt umber, i lb. dry Venetian red; apply with a brush. This stain is transparent, and allows the grain of the wood to show through. -Another. — Boil iyi ounces of washing-soda, and %. ounce bichromate of potash, in i quart of water; add 2y 2 ounces Vandyke brown. This stain may be used either hot or cold. -Another. — With a brush apply a thin solution of permanganate of potassa in water, until the desired color is produced, allowing each coat to dry before another is applied. -Oak Stain. — Add to a quart of water 2 ounces each of potash and pearlash. This is a very good stain, but it should be used carefully as it blisters the hands and softens brushes. The stain may be made lighter by adding more water. -Liquid ammonia laid on evenly with a rag or brush will deepen the color immediately, and it will not fade, this being an artificial production of result produced naturally by age. -Bichromate of potash, dissolved in cold water, and applied with a brush, will produce a similar result. -Rosewood Stain. — Mix in a bottle ]/\\\\ lb. of extract of logwood, i oz. salts of tartar, and i pint of water; in another bottle, put i lb. of old iron in small pieces, and i pint of vinegar, which, after standing twentyfour hours, will be ready for use; make a hard stiff brush with a piece of rattan sharpened at one end in a wedge shape, pounding it so as to separate the fibre. Mix in i pint of varnish, *4 lb. of finely-powdered rosepink. The materials are now ready, and the first thing in the process is to stain the wood with the logwood stain; give two coats of this, allowing the first to become nearly dry before applying the second; then dip the rattan brush in the vinegar, and with it form the grain, after which give the work a coat of the varnish and rose pink. There can be no definite directions given for graining, except to study the natural wood and imitate it as near as possible. With the above materials skilfully applied, any common wood can be made to resemble rosewood so nearly that it will take a good judge to distinguish the difference. -Another. — Boil i lb. of logwood in i gallon of water, add a double handful of walnut shells, boil the whole again, strain the liquor and add to it I pint of the best vinegar. It is then ready for use. Apply it boiling -hot, and when the wood is dry, form red veins in imitation of the grain of rosewood with a brush dipped in the following solution: Nitric acid, i pint; metallic tin, i oz. ; sal ammoniac, i oz. Mix and set aside to dissolve, occasionally shaking. -Cherry Stain. — Mix together, by stirring, i quart of spirits of turpentine, i pint of varnish, and i lb. of dry burnt sienna ; apply with a brush, and after it has been on about five minutes wipe it off with rags. This stain takes about 12 hours to dry. -Another Cherry Stain. — Take 1 quart alcohol, 2 ozs. of dragon\\'s-blood; pulverize the latter along with J4 oz. of alkanet root ; mix, and let stand in a warm place a couple of days. Shake frequently in the meantime. Apply with a sponge or brush. Two or three coats may be required. This makes a fine stain. -Red Stain for Common Work. — Archil will produce a very good stain of itself when used cold, but if after one or two coats have been applied and suffered to get almost dry, it is brushed over with a hot solution of pearlash in water, it will improve the color. -Mahogany Stain. — To darken mahogany, apply a weak solution of bichromate of potash in water. Apply successive coats, allowing each to dry, until the required shade is secured. -Surface Stains. — The following are for the most part used to apply to woods of inferior quality, to make them resemble choicer woods. The colors are all to be -mixed with very thin glue size, laid on warm with a soft woollen material, and the wood wiped dry after application. All the colors used in staining should be well pulverized, and before use the liquid should be strained. -Imitation Walnut Stain. — Burnt umber and yellow ochre, mixed in proportions to give desired shade. -Fine Crimson Stain. — Boil i lb. of good Brazil dust in 3 quarts of water for an hour; strain it, and add y 2 oz. of cochineal;, boil it again gently for half an hour, and it will be fit for use. -If you will have it more of a scarlet tint, boil half an ounce of saffron in a quart of water for an hour, and pass over the work previous to the red stain. -Fine Blue Stain. — Into i lb. of oil of vitriol (sulphuric acid) in a clean glass phial, put 4 ozs. of indigo, and proceed as above directed in dyeing purple. -Yellow Stain. — Dissolve y lb. tumeric in 1 pint alcohol; let it stand until the tumeric settles to the bottom. -Another. — A small piece of aloes added to the varnish will have all the effect of a bright yellow stain. -To Brighten Stains. — Ary of the stains named (except the surface stains) will be rendered much more brilliant by an application of the following : 1 oz. nitric acid, y teaspoonful muriatic acid, y oz. grain tin, 2 ozs. rain water. Mix in a bottle, at least two days before using, and keep the bottle well corked. -Dyeing wood is mostly applied for the purpose of veneers, while staining is more generally had recourse to to give the desired color to the article after it has been manufactured. In the one case, the color should penetrate throughout, while in the latter the surface is all that is essential. -In dyeing, pear-tree, holly and beech, take the best black; but for most colors, holly is preferable. It is also best to have wood as young and as newly cut as possible. After the veneers are cut, they should be allowed to lie in a trough of water for four or five days before they are put into the copper ; as the water, acting as a purgative to the wood, brings out an abundance of slimy matter, which must be removed, or the wood will never be a good color. After this purificatory process, they should be dried in the open air for at least twelve hours. They are then ready for the copper. By these simple means the color will strike much quicker, and be of a brighter hue. It would also add to the improvement of the colors, if, after the veneers have boiled a few hours, they are taken out, dried in the air, and again immersed in the coloring copper. Always dry veneers in the open air, for fire invariably injures the colors. -Fine Black Dye. — Put 6 lbs. of chip logwood into the copper, with as many veneers as it will conveniently -hold, without pressing too tight ; fill it with water, and let it boil slowly for about three hours; then add half a pound of powdered verdigris, half a pound of copperas, and 4 ounces of bruised nut-galls ; fill the copper up with vinegar as the water evaporates; let it boil gently two hours each day till the wood is dyed through. -Another. — Procure some liquor from a tanner\\'s pit, or make a strong decoction of oak bark, and to every gallon of the liquor add a quarter of a pound of green copperas, and mix them well together; put the liquor into the copper, and make it quite hot, but not boil ; immerse the veneers in it, and let them remain for an hour ; take them out, and expose them to the air till it has penetrated its substance ; then add some logwood to the solution, place the veneers again in it, and let it simmer for two or three hours; let the whole cool gradually. dry the veneers in the shade, and they will be a very fine black. -Fine Blue Dye. — Into a clean glass bottle put i lb. of oil of vitriol, and 4 ozs. of the best indigo pounded in a mortar (take care to set the bottle in a basin or earthen glazed pan, as it will ferment) ; then put the veneers into a copper or stone trough ; fill it rather more than one-third with water, and add as much of the vitriol and indigo (stirring it about) as will make a fine blue, which may be known by trying it with a piece of white paper or wood. Let the veneers remain till the dye has struck through. -The color will be much improved if the solution of indigo in vitriol be kept a few weeks before using it. The color will strike better if the veneers are boiled in plain water till completely soaked through, and then allowed for a few hours to dry partially, previous to being immersed in the dye. -Another. — Throw pieces of quicklime into soft water ; stir it well ; when settled, strain or pour off the clear part; then to every gallon add ten or twelve ounces of the best turnsole; put the whole into the copper with the veneers, which should be of white holly, and prepared as usual by boiling in water; let them simmer gently till the color has sufficiently penetrated, but be careful not to let them boil in it, as it would injure the color. -A Fine Yellozv Dye. — Reduce 4 lbs. of the root of barberry, by sawing, to dust, which put in a copper or brass trough ; add 4 ozs. of turmeric and 4 gallons of water, then put in as many white holly veneers as the liquor will cover; boil them together for three hours, often turning them ; when cool, add 2 ozs. of aquafortis and the dye will strike through much sooner. -A Bright Yellow Dye. — To every gallon of water necessary to cover the veneers, add 1 lb. of French berries; boil the veneers till the color has penetrated through ; add to the infusion of the French berries, the liquid for brightening colors given on page 43, and let the veneers remain for two or three hours, and the color will be very bright. -Bright Green Dye. — Proceed as in either of the previous receipts to produce a yellow; but instead of adding * aquafortis or the brightening liquid, add as much vitriolated indigo (see page 44) as will produce the desired color. -Green Dye. — Dissolve 4 ozs. of the best verdigris, and of sap-green and indigo half an ounce each, in 3 pints of the best vinegar ; put in the veneers, and gently boil till the color has penetrated sufficiently. -The hue of the green may be varied by altering the proportion of the ingredients ; and it is advised, unless wanted for a particular purpose, to leave out the sapgreen, as it is a vegetable color very apt to change, or turn brown, when exposed to the air. -Bright Red Dye. — To 2 lbs. of genuine Brazil dust, add 4 gallons of water ; put in as many veneers as the liquor will cover ; boil them for three hours ; then add 2 ozs. of alum, and 2 ozs. of aquafortis, and keep it lukewarm until it has struck through. -Red Dye. — To every pound of logwood chips, add 2 gallons of water; put in the veneers, and boil as in the last ; then add a sufficient quantity of the brightening liquid (see page 43) till you see the color to your mind; keep the whole as warm as the finger can be borne in it, till the color has sufficiently penetrated. -The logwood chips should be picked from all foreign substances, with which it generally abounds, as bark, dirt, etc. ; and it is always best when fresh cut, which -may be known by its appearing of a bright-red color; for if stale, it will look brown, and not yield so much coloring matter. -Purple Dye. — To 2 lbs. of chip logwood and half a pound of Brazil dust, add 4 gallons of water, and after putting in the veneers, boil them for at least three hours ; then add 6 ozs. of pearlash and 2 ozs. of alum ; let them boil for two or three hours every day, till the color has struck through. -The Brazil dust only contributes to make the purple of a more red cast ; you may, therefore, omit it, if you require a deep bluish purple. -Another. — Boil 2 lbs. of logwood, either in chips or powder, in 4 gallons of water, with the veneers ; after boiling till the color is well struck in, add by degrees vitriolated indigo (see page 44) till the purple is of the shade required, which may be known by trying it with a piece of paper ; let it then boil for one hour, and keep the liquid in a milk-warm state till the color has penetrated the veneer. This method, when properly managed, will produce a brilliant purple, not so likely to fade as the foregoing. -Liquid for Brightening and Setting Colors. — To every pint of strong aquafortis, add 1 oz. of grain tin, and a piece of sal ammoniac of the size of a walnut; set it by to dissolve, shake the bottle round with the cork out, from time to time; in the course of two or three days it will be fit for use. This will be found an -admirable liquid to add to any color, as it not only brightens it, but renders it less likely to fade from exposure to the air. -Orange Dye. — Let the veneers be dyed by either of the methods given in page 45, of a fine deep yellow, and while they are still wet and saturated with the dye, transfer them to the bright red dye as in page 45, till the color penetrates equally throughout. -Silver Gray Dye. — Expose to the weather in a castiron pot of six or eight gallons, old iron nails, hoops, etc., till covered with rust ; add 1 gallon of vinegar and 2 of water, boil all well for an hour; have the veneers ready, which must be hard-wood (not too dry), put them in the copper used to dye black, and pour the iron liquor over them; add 1 lb. of chip logwood and 2 ozs. of bruised nut-galls ; then boil up another pot of the iron liquor to supply the copper with, keeping the veneers covered, and boiling two hours a day, till the required color is obtained. -Gray Dye. — Expose any quantity of old iron, or what is better, the borings of gun-barrels, etc., in any convenient vessel, and from time to time sprinkle them with spirits of salt (muriatic acid) diluted in four times its quantity of water, till they are very thickly covered with rust; then to every six pounds add a gallon of water, in which has been dissolved two ounces of salt of tartar ; lay the veneers in the copper, and cover them with this liquid; let it boil for two or three hours till -well soaked, then to every gallon of liquor add a quarter of a pound of green copperas, and keep the whole at a moderate temperature till the dye has sufficiently penetrated. -Gilding, Silvering and Bronzing are processes of applying to previously prepared surfaces a thin layer of gold or silver leaf, or in bronzing, of a fine powder, prepared from various metals and intended to imitate the peculiar appearance of genuine bronze. The processes of gilding and silvering being identical, the description of one will suffice to explain the other. -Gilding. — Gold leaf, applied to articles of furniture as a means of decoration, is used in two ways; it is applied over an ordinary varnish or other finish, in which case but little special preparation is necessary; or, as when used for picture frames, cornices, etc., it is applied to a specially prepared foundation, the basis of which is whiting, mixed with various other ingredients suggested by experience or fancy. In either case, the gold leaf is caused to adhere to the work, by size specially prepared for the purpose, receipts for which follow herewith; the size being first applied to the work, and when it has become of the right consistency, the gold is laid upon it. Oil-Gilding and Burnish-Gilding are different methods used to obtain certain desired effects, the former principally for articles exposed to the weather, and for heightening the effect of incised carving or engraving, and the latter for picture-frames and articles having a specially prepared foundation, whose entire surface is. to be gilded. It is intended that the -gold shall adhere to the work only in the places to which the size has been applied, but the smallest portion of oil or even a slight dampness may cause the gold to partially adhere to the adjoining surface, resulting in slightly ragged edges; to prevent this, before applying the size to the desired design, the entire surface is covered with a thin film of some substance perfectly free from moisture, and easily removable by water, after completion of the process. Directions regarding this preliminary process are given under the caption: To Prevent Gold Adhering. -The Requisites. — First, a sufficient quantity of leafgold, which is of two sorts — the deep gold, as it is called, and the pale gold. The former is the best; the latter very useful, and may occasionally be introduced for variety or effect. -Second, a gilder\\'s cushion : an oblong piece of wood, covered with rough calf-skin, stuffed with flannel several times doubled, with a border of parchment, about four inches deep, at one end, to prevent the air blowing the leaves about when placed on the cushion. -Fourthly, several camel-hair pencils in sizes, and tips, made of a few long camel\\'s hairs put between two cards, in the same manner as hairs are put into tin cases for brushes, thus making a flat brush with a very few hairs. -Sizes. — These are of two kinds: oil sizes are those which when applied, present an adhesive surface, requiring the immediate laying of the gold-leaf upon it ; of this class is the oil-size commonly used in decorating furniture; water-sizes are those that are allowed to become dry and hard when applied, and are rendered adhesive when the gold is to be laid, by brushing over with water; for burnish-gilding these are always employed, as oil-size does not dry sufficiently hard to permit of burnishing. -Oil-Size for Oil-Gilding. — Grind calcined red-ochre with the best and oldest drying-oil. When desired for use, add sufficient oil of turpentine to make it work freely. -Parchment-Size. — For preparing Frames, etc. — To half a pound of parchment shavings, or cuttings of white leather, add three quarts of water, and boil it in a proper vessel till reduced to nearly-half the quantity; then take it off the fire, and strain it through a sieve. Be careful in the boiling to keep it well stirred, and do not let burn. -Gold-Size for Burnish-Gilding. — Grind fine salammoniac well with a muller and stone ; scrape into it a little beef suet, and grind all well together; after which, mix in with a pallet-knife a small proportion of parchment-size with a double proportion of water. -Another. — Grind a lump of tobacco-pipe clay into a very stiff paste with thin size ; add a small quantity of ruddle and fine black lead, ground very fine, and temper the whole with a small piece of tallow. When ready to use, reduce with parchment-size until it will just flow from the brush. -Another. — Grind separately in water, i lb. Armenian bole, 2 ozs. red lead, a sufficient quantity of black lead ; mix, and regrind with a small quantity of olive oil. Reduce with parchment-size to the proper consistency. -To Prevent Gold Adhering. — Either one of the following methods will prevent gold-leaf or bronze from adhering to the surface beyond the outlines of the sizing laid on to receive it : -2. Whiting mixed in water, and applied with a soft brush. When the water has evaporated, dust off the superfluous whiting with an ordinary paint duster. By this method a very thin coating of whiting remains, which is free from any grittiness. One advantage gained by the use of whiting thus applied is, it furnishes a whitish ground over which clear varnish or oil-size may be distinctly seen as the striping progresses. After the leaf or bronze has been applied, the work must be carefully washed, so as to insure the removal of the whiting. -4. A thin wash of starch water, either brushed on with a flat camel-hair brush, or applied with a soft sponge. -5. Take ball liquorice and water, a weak solution, and apply with a soft brush. This may be kept in a bottle ready for use at any time. -6. Cut a new potato in two, and rub over the part to be sized with the raw face exposed, allowing the juice to remain until dry. -It will be observed that any substance which interposes a film over the varnish, itself being free from tackiness and readily removed by water, will answer the purpose. -Oil Gilding. — Applying the Gold. — If the wood to be gilded is finished with varnish or otherwise, no additional foundation is necessary upon which to lay the gold-leaf; if the wood is not finished, after it has been smoothed and dusted, give it one or two coats of parchment size, after it is perfectly dry and hard, again smoothing the surface with fine sand-paper. That the gold may not adhere to any part of the work except where the size is hard, powder the surface lightly with whiting from a pounce-bag, which is a small bag made of material sufficiently loose to permit the powdered whiting to sift through as fine dust; if preferred, any of the preceding receipts for that purpose can be used -instead. Remove the surplus whiting with the dustingbrush, and the work is then ready for the size. Apply this with a sable or fit brush of the proper size, carefully observing to make the outer lines of the design clear and sharp, that the work may not appear ragged. Let the size remain until it feels tacky, when the gold may be applied. This is the most difficult part of the operation, and experience is necessary before gold-leaf can be laid smoothly without a wrinkle or a break. Turn a leaf of gold out of the book upon the cushion; breathe gently upon the center of the leaf and it will lay flat on the cushion; cut it to the proper size by bringing the knife perpendicularly over it, and sawing it gently until divided. Take your tip (a brush used for the purpose) and after drawing it lightly over your hair to remove any particles of dust that may be upon it, breathe upon it gently, which will dampen it sufficiently to cause the leaf of gold to adhere to it ; lay the tip upon the leaf of gold and carefully transfer it to the work; blow upon it gently and it will straighten out and adhere. It may be rendered quite smooth by slightly dabbing it with a bit of cotton. In about an hour wash off the superfluous gold from the edges, with a sponge and water. If the article is to be exposed to the weather or much wear, the gilding may be varnished with copal varnish. -Burnish-Gilding. — As previously stated, this process requires a specially prepared foundation upon which to -lay the gold, and as the preparation of this foundation is a distinct trade, the furniture dealer or cabinet-maker seldom finds it necessary to undertake it, the articles coming to his hand ready-prepared for gilding; but as in repairing picture-frames, cornices, mirror frames, etc., it frequently becomes necessary to renew the foundation, a comprehensive description of the whole process is given. -Preparing the Wood-work. — After smoothing and dusting the work, coat the frames in every part with boiling-hot parchment-size, as previously described, then mix a sufficient quantity of whiting with size to the consistency of thick cream, and with it by means of a brush, coat every part of the frame several times, permitting each coat to become perfectly dry before proceeding with the next. The wood will thus be covered with a layer of hard whiting nearly or quite a sixteenth of an inch in thickness. The size must not be too thick, and when mixed with the whiting should not be so hot as the preliminary coat of size. -Polishing. — When the prepared frames are quite dry, clean and polish them. To do this, wet a small piece at a time, and, with a smooth, fine piece of cloth, dipped in water, rub the part till all the bumps and inequalities are removed ; and for those parts where the fingers will not enter, as the mouldings, etc., wind the wet cloth round a piece of wood, and by this means make the surface all smooth and even alike. -Where there is carved work, etc., it will sometimes be necessary to bring the mouldings to their original sharpness by means of chisels, gouges, etc., as the preparation will be apt to fill up all the finer parts of the work, which must be thus restored. It is sometimes the practice, after polishing, to go over the work once with fine yellow or Roman ochre; but this is rarely necessary. -Applying the Size. — Select the proper gold size from the receipts previously given ; add parchment size until it will just flow from the brush ; make it quite hot, and apply it to the work with a very soft brush, taking care not to make the first coat too thick ; let it dry and give two or three successive coats, after the last brushing it with a stiff brush to remove any inequalities. The work is then ready for the gold. -Laying the Gold. — The manipulation of the gold-leaf has been described under the heading Oil-Gilding. In the process now being described, the size used (being water-size, which as previously explained is permitted to become hard and dry after being applied) must be moistened to cause the gold-leaf to adhere to it. For this purpose, with a long-haired camel-hair pencil, dipped in water, go over as much of the work as you intend the piece of gold to cover; then lay the gold upon it in the manner previously explained. Be sure that the part to which the gold is applied is sufficiently wet; indeed it must be floating, or the gold will be apt -to crack. Proceed in this manner a little at a time, and do not attempt to cover too much at once, until by experience you are able to handle the gold with freedom. In proceeding with the work, if any flows or cracks appear, immediately apply a portion of gold sufficient to cover them. Sometimes when the gold does not appear to adhere sufficiently tight, it will be necessary to draw a pencil quite filled with water close to the edge of the gold, that the water may run underneath it and soften the size. -Burnishing. — When the work is covered with gold, set it by to dry; there is a particular state or degree of dryness, known only by experience in which the moulding is in a fit state for burnishing ; it will probably be ready to burnish in about eight of ten hours, but it will depend on the warmth of the room or state of the air. -When it is ready, those parts intended to be burnished must be dusted with a soft brush; then wiping the burnisher with a piece of soft wash-leather (quite dry) begin to burnish about an inch or two in length at a time, taking care not to bear too hard, but with a gentle and quick motion, applying the tool until all the parts of the surface are equally bright. -Matting or Dead Gold. — Certain portions only of the work are burnished, according to the fancy, and the facility with which the burnishing-tool can be applied; the remaining parts are now to be deprived of -their metallic lustre, to make a more effective contrast with the burnishing. The parts thus treated are said to be matted or dead-gold. The process is as follows *. -Grind some vermilion or yellow ochre very fine, and mix a very small portion either with the parchment size or with the white of an egg, and with a very soft brush lay it evenly on the parts to be dulled; if well done, it will add greatly to the beauty of the work. Previous to matting, the work must be well cleared of superfluous gold, by means of a soft brush. -Finishing. — In elaborate works it is frequently impossible to lay gold-leaf into all the intricacies of an elaborate design, and the parts thus left bare must be finished by touching up with a small brush charged with shell-gold, or gold-powder, mixed with gum-Arabic to the proper consistency. The following receipt describes the preparation of shell-gold : -Shell Gold. — Take any quantity of leaf-gold and grind it with a small portion of honey, to a fine powder, add a little gum-Arabic and sugar-candy, with a little water, and mix it well together ; let it dry. -Silver She. — Grind pipe-clay fine with a little blacklead and good soap, and add parchment-size as directed for gold-size. -Composition for Frame Ornaments. — The ornaments for gilded mirror-frames, etc., are usually moulded from some plastic substance that is somewhat tougher and more durable than the ordinary gilding founda-tion of whiting and size. The proper moulds being prepared they are thoroughly rubbed upon the inside with sweet oil, and the composition firmly pressed in; after removing the mould the cast may be dried by a gentle heat, or while still plastic it can be applied in its proper place and bent into any position. Following are receipts for composition : -Dissolve i lb. of glue in i gallon of water. In another kettle boil together 2 lbs. of resin, 1 gill of Venice turpentine, and 1 pint of linseed oil ; mix altogether in one kettle, and boil and stir till the water has evaporated. Turn the whole into a tub of finely-rolled whiting, and work it till it is of the consistency of dough. -Boil 7 lbs. of best glue in 7 half-pints of water. Melt 3 lbs. of white resin in 3 pints of raw linseed oil. When the above has been well boiled put them into a large vessel and simmer them for half an hour, stirring the mixture and taking care that it does not boil over. The whole must then be turned into a box of whiting rolled and sifted, and mixed till it is of the consistency of dough. -To Manipulate Gold Leaf. — Get a piece of paper, thin enough to show shadow of gold-leaf through, slightly wax.it, lay it on .gold-leaf, the latter will then adhere, and can be easily worked, and will come off clean. The paper should be slightly larger than the gold-leaf, and the fingers passed over the paper to make the gold-leaf adhere. -Bronzing. — This is a process for imitating on metal, plaster, wood, or other material, the peculiar appearance produced by chemical action upon the surface of bronze metal. It is accomplished by spreading over the surface of the material to be ornamented a very thin coating of bronze-powder, which is caused to adhere either by applying it directly upon a coating of any of the sizes mentioned in the foregoing pages, or by mixing with a vehicle, such as gum-Arabic or transparent varnish. The latter is most desirable, as in the other case, being subject to the direct action of the atmosphere, the bronzepowder soon tarnishes. In ornamenting furniture, bronzing is generally employed to represent gilding, a variety of bronze called gold-bronze being used, which affords an excellent imitation but is not very lasting. It is usually applied after the completion of the other finishing processes, the ground work being prepared in the manner described under Oil-Gilding, and the size likewise applied as there described. A small wad of cotton-batting is then dipped in the bronze and passed gently over the sized portions, causing the bronze to adhere. In the other method — that of applying the bronze by means of a vehicle — the preliminaries of whiting the ground and sizing are not necessary, a small quantity of bronze being simply mixed with the vehicle employed to such a degree of fluidity that it will flow easily, and in that condition applied with a fine brush. Many preparations are -used as vehicles, such as transparent varnish thinned with turpentine, gum-Arabic dissolved in water, and gold-size reduced with parchment-size. There are a variety of colors in bronze-powders, and to produce the best effect the size or vehicle should be of a color similar to that of the bronze used; in gold-size the coloring pigment is ochre, and in its place, for greenbronze, red-bronze, or blue-bronze, may be employed respectively verditer, vermilion or Prussian blue, a very small quantity being sufficient. In bronzing on painted work the ground should be as nearly as possible the color of the bronze to be applied. -Glue. — Glue is prepared from waste pieces of skin, horns, hoofs, and other animal offal. These are steeped, washed, boiled, strained, melted, reboiled and cast into square cakes, which are then dried. The strongest kind of glue is made from the hides of oxen ; that from the bones and sinews is weaker. The older the animal the stronger the glue. Good glue should be hard in the cake, of a strong, dark color, almost transparent, free from black or cloudy spots, and with little or no smell. The best sorts are transparent and of a clear amber color. Inferior kinds are sometimes contaminated with the lime used for removing the hair from the skins of which they are made. The best glue swells considerably (the more the better) when immersed in cold water, but does not dissolve, and returns to its former size when dry. Inferior glue made from bones, will, however, dissolve almost entirely in cold water. -To Prepare Glue. — To prepare glue for use it should be broken up into small pieces, and soaked in as much cold water as will cover it, for about twelve hours. It should then be melted in a double glue pot, covered to keep the glue from dirt. Care must be taken to keep the outer vessel full of water, so that the glue shall not burn, or be brought to a temperature higher than that of boiling water. The glue is allowed to simmer for -two or three hours, then gradually melted, so much hot water being added as will make it liquid enough, just to run off a brush in a continuous stream, without breaking into drops. When the glue is done with, some boiling water should be added to make it very thin before it is put away. Freshly-made glue is stronger than that which has been repeatedly melted. Too large a quantity should not therefore be made at a time. Glue may be freed from the foreign animal matter generally in it by softening it in cold water, washing it with the same several times, till it no longer gives out any color, then bruising it with the hand, and suspending it in a linen bag beneath the surface of a large quantity of water at 66° Fahr. By doing this the pure glue is retained in the bag, and the soluble impurities pass through. If the softened glue be heated to 122 without water, and filtered, some other impurities will be retained by the filter, and a colorless solution of glue be obtained. -The addition of a little bichromate of potash will render glue impervious to moisture after exposing to the light, and a small quantity of methylated spirits will greatly improve its keeping qualities. -Mixing Glue. — A minimum amount of glue should be used in good work, and it should be applied as hot as possible. The surfaces of the wood to be united should be clean, dry, and true ; they should be brought together as tightly as possible, so that the superfluous -glue is squeezed out. The cohesion of a piece of solid glue, or the force required to separate one square inch, is four thousand pounds. The strength of common glue for coarse work is increased by the addition of a little powdered chalk. The hotter the glue the greater its cohesion; therefore in all large and long joints the glue should be applied immediately after boiling. Glue loses much of its strength by frequent re-melting ; that glue, therefore, which is newly made, is much preferable to that which has been re-boiled. -Glue Pot. — A glue pot recently perfected consists of a circular kerosene lamp, made of tin, resting upon a tin bottom 8y 2 inches in diameter. The lamp is fitted with a tin chimney in place of glass, and fitted with a small aperture, covered with mica, so as to see how to regulate the flame. The glue pot is made of copper, tinned on the inside and supported upon a rim setting up about six inches from the bottom of the lamp, the rim supported by three legs, soldered and riveted to the rim and bottom of lamp rest. The pot in which the bottom is placed has a portion of the bottom arched, to give more heating surface, and connecting with the chamber under the pot is a flue, passing out and up alongside of the pot, which carries off any smoke from the lamp, and also acts as a draft to the flame. This pot is five inches in diameter, and about six inches high. The pot for the reception of the glue is set in the same as an ordinary glue pot, and will hold about a -quart of glue. The whole can be carried to any place where you wish to use it, and still have the heat kept up. The cost of oil is but a few cents a week. -Another improvement is in the pot being of copper, tinned. It will not corrode and spoil the glue, as is the case with iron. -French cabinet-makers use a glue pot with an inside pan made of glazed earthenware and divided radially into three divisions, in one of which is kept strong glue, in another weaker, and in the third water only, with a brush or piece of sponge for cleaning off superfluous glue from the work. -A few holes bored near the top of the inner vessel of a glue pot by admitting steam from the outer vessel will prevent the glue from solidifying on the side. They need not be bored round the whole circumference of the pot, to allow of pouring out the glue if necessary. -To Prevent Glue Cracking. — Glue frequently cracks because of the dryness of the air in rooms warmed by .stoves. The addition of chloride of calcium to glue will prevent this disagreeable property of cracking. Chloride of calcium is such a deliquescent salt that it attracts enough moisture to prevent the glue from cracking. Glue thus prepared will adhere to glass, metal, etc., and can be used for putting on labels without danger of their dropping off. -Strong Glue to Resist Moisture. — Dissolve gumsandarac and mastic, of each a quarter of an ounce, in -a quarter of a pint of spirits of wine, to which add a\" quarter of an ounce of clear turpentine; now take strong glue, or that in which isinglass has been dissolved; then, putting the gums into a double glue-pot, add by degrees the glue, constantly stirring it over the fire till the whole is well incorporated ; strain it through a cloth, and it is ready for use. You may now return it to the glue pot, and add half an ounce of very finelypowdered glass ; use it quite hot. If you join two pieces, of wood together with it, you may, when perfectly hard and dry, immerse it in water, and the joint will not separate. -Glue to Resist Moisture. — To two quarts of skimmed milk add half a pound of the best glue ; melt them together, taking care they do not boil over, and you will have a very strong glue, which will resist damp or moisture. -Portable Glue. — Boil one pound of the best glue, strain it very clear; boil also four ounces of isinglass; put it into a double glue-pot, with half a pound of fine brown sugar, and boil it pretty thick ; then pour it into plates or moulds. When cold you may cut and dry them for the pocket. -This glue is very useful to draughtsmen, architects* etc., as it immediately dilutes in warm water, and fastens the paper without the process of dampening; or, it may be used by softening it in the mouth/ and applying it to the paper. -How to get fresh air in the glue room during the hot periods of summer, and at the same time not have the disturbing drafts that evaporate thinly-spread glue, is quite a problem. Yet, like many other problems, it is largely a matter of attention to details. . There are various ways of ventilating rooms so as to get fresh air without getting a strong current. The temptation is naturally strong to throw open windows and doors in hot weather, so as to have a breeze, but generally this is the very thing one must guard against. -Some glue rooms that have windows on one side and the other three sides carefully inclosed, may have the windows opened without producing a strong draft, but, even so, it is better to have window screens made of fine, close-meshed wire, something like those used on railway trains to keep out the dust. They will help keep out the dust, keep out the draft, and also keep out insects that are tempted by the odor of the glue to make a visit to the glue room. There are other variations, such as letting down the top windows instead of raising the bottom ones; others in which a box-like arrangement opening upward instead of straight in, is inserted under the window to let in the fresh air and turn it upward instead of across the room. These are mechanical ventilators that can be used for scientifically ventilating a room without producing currents. And -there are, in fact, many ways to get around this draft business, and while their use may deprive the glue room of some of the breeziness that is inviting in summer, still they will furnish fresh air in a manner that is more healthful to those working in it, as well as less damaging to the glue work than strong currents. -To Raise Old Veneers. — First, wash the surface with boiling water, and, with a coarse cloth, remove dirt or grease; then place it before the fire, or heat it with a caul; oil its surface with common linseed-oil, place it again to the fire, and the heat will make the oil penetrate quite through the veneer, and soften the glue underneath ; then, while hot, raise the edge gently with a chisel, and it will separate completely from the ground ; be careful not to use too great force, or the work will be spoiled. Again, if it should get cold during the operation, apply more oil, and heat it again. Repeat this process till the veneer is entirely separated, then wash off the old glue and proceed to lay it again as a new veneer. -To Take Out Bruises in Furniture. — Wet the part with warm water; double a piece of brown paper five or six times, soak it, and lay it on the place ; apply on that a hot flat-iron till the moisture is evaporated. If the bruise be not gone, repeat the process. After two or three applications, the dent or bruise will be raised level with the surface. If the bruise be small, merely soak it with warm water, and apply a red-hot poker very near the surface; keep it continually wet, and in a few minutes the bruise will disappear. -To Make Paste for Laying Cloth or Leather. — To a pint of the best wheaten flour add resin, very finely -powdered, about two large spoonfuls; of alum, one spoonful, in powder; mix them all well together, put them into a pan, and add by degrees soft or rain water, carefully stirring it till it is of the consistence of thinnish cream; put it into a saucepan over a clear fire, keeping it constantly stirred, that it may not get lumpy. When it is of a stiff consistence, so that the spoon will stand upright in it, it is done enough. Be careful to stir it well from the bottom, for it will burn if not well attended to. Empty it out into a pan and cover it over till cold, to prevent a skin forming on the top, which would make it lumpy. -This paste is very superior for the purpose, and adhesive. To use it for cloth or baize, spread the paste evenly and smoothly on the top of the table, and lay the cloth on it, pressing and smoothing it with a flat piece of wood; let it remain till dry; then trim the edges close to the cross-banding. If you cut it close at first, it will, in drying, shrink and look bad where it meets the banding all round. If used for leather, the leather must be first previously damped, and then the paste spread over it; then lay it on the table, and rub it smooth and level with a linen cloth, and cut the edges close to the banding with a short knife. Some lay their table cover with glue instead of paste, and for cloth perhaps it is the best method; but for leather it is not proper, as glue is apt to run through. In using it for cloth, great care must be taken that the glue be -not too thin, and that the cloth be well rubbed down with a thick piece of wood made hot at the fire, for the glue soon chills. By this method, the edges may be cut off close to the border at once. -Cements for Stopping Flaws in Wood. — Put any quantity of fine sawdust of the same wood your work is made with into an earthen pan, and pour boiling water on it, stir it well, and let it remain for a week or ten days, occasionally stirring it; then boil it for some time, and it will be of the consistence of pulp or paste ; put it into a coarse cloth, and squeeze all the moisture from it. Keep for use, and, when wanted, mix a sufficient quantity of thin glue to make it into a paste ; rub it well into the cracks, or fill up the holes in your work with it. When quite hard and dry, clean your work off, and if carefully done, you will scarcely discern the imperfection. -Mahogany-Colored Cement. — Melt two ounces of beeswax and half an ounce of Indian red,, and a small quantity of yellow ochre, to bring the. cement to the desired color ; keep it in a pipkin for use. , -Cement for Turners. — Melt together beeswax, one ounce ; resin, half an ounce ; and pitch, half an ounce ; stir in the mixture some very fine brickdust to give it a body. If too soft, add more resin; if too hard, more wax. When nearly cold, make it up into cakes or rolls, which keep for use. -piece of wood on the chuck, which is done by applying the roller of cement to the chuck and it will adhere with sufficient force. -To Cut Good Steel Scrapers. — Part of the blade of a broken saw makes the best scrapers ; but, as it is hard, it is very difficult to cut it into the required form. The best and most expeditious way is to mark it out to the size wanted, and then to place the blade or steel plate in a vice whose chaps shut very close, placing the mark even with the face of the vise, and the part to be cut to waste above the vise. Then with a cold-chisel, or a common steel-firmer that has its basil broken off, holding it close to the vise and rather inclined upwards, begin at one end of the steel plate, and with a sharp blow of the hammer it will cut it. Keep going on by degrees, and you will with ease cut it to the shape required ; then grind the edges of your scraper level, and finish by rubbing it on your oil stone. -To Clean Oil Paintings. — Wash with a sponge or a soft leather and water, and dry by rubbing with a silk handkerchief. When the picture is very dirty, take it out of its frame, procure a clean towel, and making it quite wet, lay it on the face of the picture, sprinkling it from time to time with clear soft water ; let it remain wet for two or three days ; take the cloth off and renew it with a fresh one; after wiping the picture with a clean wet sponge, repeat the process till all the dirt is soaked out ; then wash it well with a soft sponge, and let -it get dry; rub it with some clear nut or linseed oil. Spirits of wine and turpentine may be used to dissolve the hard old varnish, but they will attack the paint as well as the varnish if the further action of the spirits is not stopped at the proper time by using water freely. -Cleaning Varnished Pictures. — There are conditions where the above simple process will not accomplish what is required ; where a thick coating of varnish has been applied to the picture, and it has been hung in a smoky room, and dust and dirt has been allowed to gather and remain; then it is that no high lights will be visible, the sky will be dirty, no distance visible, and perhaps the figures in the foreground very indistinct. Under these conditions the varnish must be either removed or the smoke and dirt must be brought out of the varnish. If it is thought desirable to try the latter, the following receipt will be found valuable for the purpose: 2 oz. wood naptha, 1 oz. spirits of salts, % pint of linseed-oil. -Mix the above well together, and before using shake the bottle. It can be used as follows : Get some soft linen rag, and make up a soft pad, which place on the mouth of the bottle and shake up some of the mixture into the pad, then commence rubbing the picture with a circular motion, and when nearly dry again give the pad another dressing of mixture, and continue this mode of procedure for some time, when the picture will gradually come out in all its detail. -Cleaning Engravings. — Put the engraving on a smooth board, cover it thinly with common salt finely powdered. Squeeze lemon juice upon the salt so as to dissolve a considerable portion of it; elevate one end of the board so that it may form an angle of about \\'45 or 50 degrees. Pour on the engraving boiling water from a tea kettle until the salt and lemon juice be all washed off. The engraving then will be perfectly clean and free from stains. It must be dried on the board or some smooth surface gradually. If dried by the fire or the sun it will be tinged with a yellow color. -Cleaning Engravings. — Presuming these to be mounted, proceed in the following manner: Cut a stale loaf in half, with a perfectly clean knife ; pare the crust away from the edges. Now place the engravings on a perfectly flat table, and rubbing the surface with the fresh-cut bread, in circular sweeps, lightly but firmly performed, will remove 1 all superficial markings: Now soak the prints for a short time in a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid,\" say 1 part acid to rocrof water, and then remove them into -a vessel containing a sufficient quantity of clear chloride lime -water to cover them. Leave them there until bleached to the desired point: Now remove, rinse well by allowing to stand an hour in a pan in which a constant stream of water is allowed to flow, and finally dry off by spreading on clean cloths. Perhaps -the sheetsmay -require ironing between two sheets of clean paper; -To Smooth a Damaged Picture. — Paintings sometimes get convex and concave patches on their surface, owing to pressure on one side or the other, and these inequalities cause a great deal of trouble to bring out. The most successful way is to well wet both sides of the picture on the spot, and keep it under pressure till dry. With small pictures the quickest way would be to take them off the stretcher and lay them in a press, with a light pressure between soft sheets of paper. -Embossed Gilding for Illuminating. — Gilding of figures and letters on paper and for the embellishment of manuscripts, is performed with shell gold tempered with gum water; or the characters may be drawn with a milky solutionof gum ammanacum made in water, and ^old leaf applied upon them when almost dry ; they may again be sufficiently moistened for receiving the gold by breathing on them. Letters raised from the surface, if paper or parchment in the manner of embossed work, such as are seen on ancient manuscripts, may be formed either by friction on a proper body with a solid piece of gold, or by leaf gold. -The former method is practiced by tempering pulverizers\\' crystal with strong gum water, and with this paste forming the letters ; when they are dry, they are rubbed with a piece of solid gold as in polishing, and the letters will appear as if gilt with burnished gold. The letters are formed with an embossed figure, either of the separate letters or of whole words cut in steel, -and each letter of these stamps when they are used, is oiled evenly with a feather. Then fill these concave letters with the above paste, and strike the stamps in a perpendicular direction on the paper or vellum laid on sheets of soft paper. -When the embossed letters are formed with leaf gold, the following or a similar composition must be used. Thicken beaten whites of eggs with as much vermilion as is necessary to give them the consistence of paste ; use the stamps as before, and when the letters are dry moisten them by a small pencil with strong gum water, and when this is almost dry cover the letters with leaf gold, pressing it close to every part of them with cotton wood ; when dry, burnish. -Skip to main content Search UPLOAD SIGN UP | LOG IN BOOKS VIDEO AUDIO SOFTWARE IMAGESABOUT BLOG PROJECTS HELP DONATE  CONTACT JOBS VOLUNTEER PEOPLE Search Metadata Search text contents Search TV news captions Search radio transcripts Search archived websitesAdvanced SearchSign up for freeLog inFull text of \"ERIC ED541816: Legal Education in Great Britain. Bulletin, 1915, No. 18. Whole Number 643\"See other formatsUNITED STATES BUREAU OF EDUCATION -OF THIS PUBLICATION* MAY BE FROCURF.D FROM THE SUPERINTENDENT OF DOCUMENTS GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE WASHINGTON, D. C. -Admission to the legal^ profusion in England is controlled by organizations representing the solicitors and barristers, the two great division^ into which the profession is divided. This control by private organizations is peculiar to England, and a proper appreciation of the present condition and tendencies in English legal education therefore requires a somewhat detailed vacctAmt of these societies and their activities. J -The division of tho profession into two classes, the solicitors and -barristers, docs not exist in tho United States. w Tho activities of the solicitor correspond, roughly, to thoso of tho so-called office lawyer in America^ while the barrister corresponds to the trial lawyer. The solicitor may appear as an advocate in the inferior courts and in non controversial matters in chambers before judges of the High Court. By tho conveyancing act passed in 1881 the solicitor i 9 permitted to do all kinds of conveyancing, a field formerly belonging exclusively to tho barrister. Tho barrister\\'s. chief function is to conduct trials before the High Court; he is employed by tho solicitor and does not como in contact with the client in tho first instance. -The incorporated Law Spciety was established in 1827 and incorporated in 1831, succeeding an earlier society dating back to 1739. In 1833 courses of lectures were established for law clerks, and the present system of instruction dates from 1903. The society\\'s control over admission to the roll of solicitors is derived from parliamentary sanction. 1 Thesociety now has a membership of over 9,000 scattered throughout tho United Kingdom and the Crown colonies. ^ -The law society is not only an ex amining body, but since 1903 has maintained, a system of instruction in London and at various provincial Centers “and also a correspondence course. The principal law school is maintained in the society\\'s building in London. It is presided over by a principal and director of legal studies corresponding to the -dean in American schools; there are, in addition, a. -1 Saos. 6 and 7, Viet., ch. 73; 7 and 8, Vtot./ch. 88; 23 and 24, Viet., eh. 127; 83 fend 84, Viet, oh. 28; 88 and 37, Vlot., U; 37 and 88, Viet, oh. 88; 88 and* 88, Vkrt., eh. 77; 40 and 41, Vtot., oh. 26. -reader, ranked as assistant professor; six tutors ranking ns instructors; one lecturer on commercial law; a tutor in criminal law; and a tutor in accounting and bookkeeping. Tho supervision of the school is in the hands of tho legal education committeo of tho society, which is composed of 10 members of tho council of tho society, 5 members representing provincial law societies, and 2 members of the London law students’ society. The teaching year is divided into four terms of about eight weeks each. Classes aro held at such hours as will best accommodate the clerks who aro in solicitors’ office® The courses covered ombraco tho topics covered in tho intermediate and final examinations. -Attendance is not required. In 1913 tho attendance was 209. This number seems small when compared with tho total taking tho examinations, but it was greater than in preceding years. -Examinations aro held at tho end of each course, but attendance is voluntary and does not exempt from tho finals or intermediato examinations. -Tho fees in the law school aro relatively low— £10 for completo courso ami revision class; correspondence, £7; extra order, £15. -Tho report of tho society shows a falling off in tho number of articles registered sinco 1902. In 1902, 785 articles wero registered as against 534 in 1912, a decrease of 251. Solicitors admitted in’ 1902 numbered 557 ; in 1912, 494, a decrease of 63. -In addition to tho law school maintained in London instruction is given in various provincial centers, the society making grants to local societies for this purpose. In many instances theso local schools are maintained by local universities, under the supervision of boards of legal studies made up of representatives of tho university local law societies and tho law society. The latter has been largely instrumental in the formation and administration of these schools. -In 1914 the society granted £2,275, or SI 1,375, to provincial law\\' societies. Tho law society is represented on tho boards of tho following centers of legal education: -Cardiff. University College of South. Wales and Monmouthshire, joint board of legal studies and local societies. -Leeds. University of Leeds, Yorkshire, board of legal studies (railway faro paid for \\' students in district), degrees. -Nottingham. University Collego and Nottingham and Midland board of legal studies. Sheffield. University of Sheffield and Yorkshire, board of legal studies, degrees. -Swansea. University College, Univcnaty of, Wales, Aberystwyth, Neith board of legal studios, degrees. * -Correspondence coursos are also offered by the socioty for the benefit jnf articled clerks who are not convenient to a local center. -A correspondence tutor is employed. In 1913 65 students were thus instructed, the fees being £8 10s. for the finals. The correspondence\\' studjris not advocated except for those students who resido a dis\\' tance from a local center. With the growth of center school, the importance of the correspondence study will decroaso. -As preliminary to admission to the rank of .solicitor, the candidate must be articled or apprenticed to ^solicitor inactive practice, the period of the apprenticeship ranging from three to five yeare, according to the amount of previous education. Holders of the A, B. degree from Oxford, Cambridge, Dublin, Durham, London, and Queen\\'s College, Ireland; tho LL, B., LL. D., A, B., or A. M, from the Scottish universities, and “utter” barristers, serve three yeara. Barristers of five years 1 standing are not required to enter into articles, but need only pass tho final examine ion. By action of tho Master of the Rolls and tho Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor, students who have had one year of 9tudy in an approved law school before entering into articles are required to serve but four years.. All others, must serve five years. -The barristers are members of the inns of court of tho various law inns. Only tho four principal ones \"survive. They are Lincoln\\'s Inn, Gray’s Inn, tho Middle Temple, and the Inner Temple. Each inn has the right to call its raembers to the bar, but for the sake of uniformity in requirements and for the purposes of instruction! the -1 The laws relating to solicitors and legal education of the same now In force are to be found hi 0 and 7 Viet, ch.73, 1643; 7 and 8Vict,ch.86, 1844; 73 and 24 Viet, cb. 127; 33 and 34 Viet, cfa. 28; 30 and 37 Viet, ch. 81, 1873; 36 and 37 Viet., ch. 66, 1873; 37 and 38 Vlct.ch. 06, 1874; 38 and 39 Vlct.,cfa. 77, 1873; 40 and 41 Viet, Ch. 2fi, 1877. -“Council of legal education,\" composed of representatives of the soveral inns, has boen established. Unlike the law society, the right of tbo inns to call to the bar is not based upon legislative sanction , tut upon immemorial usage. Tho origin of the inns themselves is shrouded in obscurity, although\\' their existence in form is traceable r * •* fw back as the thirteenth century, when, with the establishment of tho court of common pleas at Westminister, by a cluuse\\'of Magna Chafta, there resulted tho congregation in London of lawyers and their apprentices who resided together in hostels or inns. To tho four principal inns which still survive were attached subsidiary inns, 10 or more in number, called tho urns of chancery. It was customary for apprentices or students to begin their readings in one of the inns of chancqtf, transferring after two years to one of the four inns. Tho usual period of apprenticeship during the early period was seven years. The apprentice resided in the inn, attended lectures or readings, copied pleadings and participated in tho moots and botes pre• sided Over by tbe benchers or governors of tho inn. It was in tho inns that tho English law was first scholastically taught, and to this fact Prof. Maitland attributes the escape of the English law from the fate that overwhelmed tho native law of Germany and Scotland at tho hands of the oil-conquering Roman law. -Outside of the inns no opportunity for rho study of the common law waarturid until a comparatively late period. The first lectures of any AdHIl the universities were given in ]75S, when William Blackstonqfbcgnn his career at Oxford. Ail writers agree-as to tho • vitality and activity of the inns in teaching in the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries. Tho corporate life of the inns constantly declined from the sixteenth century, until by 1815 tho benchers had ceased to concern themselves with teaching, and tho requirements for tho bar became purely formal. In 1852, ns a result of agitation, tho council of legal education was formed, being made up of 20 benchers, 5 from each inn. Tho council has drawn Tip the “Consolidated Regulations\" governing admission of students to. tho inns and calls to the bar. -The council has created a board of legal studies consisting of members of tho council and the teaching staff, the latter consisting of seven readers ami four assistant readers. Tfcis board directs tho education and examination of x students, and the law school of tho inns is conducted under the supervision of this board, the administrative work being performed by tho director of legal studies, wjio is also & reader or professor. Classes are held in the halls of the inns, each inn taking turns in providing lecture rooms. The work of the year is done in four educational terms of frqm three to four weeks ,each. Residence in the inns is not required, but the student is com-polled to “keep terms\"— that is, by dining in tho inn of which ho is a member. Members who are also members of the principal English, Scottish, Irish, ami Welsh universities keep tonus by dining in their inn any three days in eacli terin: Twelve terms must bo kept Wforo t ho student is eligible to a call to the bar. In some instances the keeping of term may be modified, but not to exceed two terms, ^ Students not members of a university as above must dine six days in each term. Solicitors of not less than five yenra* standing weed not keep tenths, but must pass the final examinations. Kaeji student pays JC5, which Entitles him to attend classes while he is a student. The f**os are much less than in the school of the l#w society. 9 \\' 1 -The expends of the School are met from a common \\'fund main* t dined by the inns. All lees are paid into this fund, and each inn contributes a minimum sum of $1 fc S00. Defioihi are met by the inns in proportion to the number of students. -Attendance on the lectures is not required, although an effort is made to induce attendance by making^the examinations cover tho work of the lecture room. Although 1,639 w<fro registered in the inns in 1913, the average class attendance in the most popular classes, those in Knglish law, was only 100, Vhe custom of not attending leMures’pre, vails in non professional schools both in .England and on Or* Continent, preparation for the examinations being made by private study or under tutors. This practice is in striking contrast to the practice in American colleges and universities generally, where. nttendiuieo on the lectures is required as prerequisite to tho examination. -Faculties in law exist in the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, London, l*»ods, Sheffield, Manchester, IJvejfooo], In the l ni verities of Birmingham and Bristol; Cniversh v College of South Wales, Cardiff; and University College, Nottingham, courses yi law are offered, but no faculties of Jaw: have been organized. Courses in law are also provided at various provincial centers, under the patronage of the law society. -In Scotlaiflf, faculties of law exist in the Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen. Some instruction in law is given at Dundee and ST. Andrews, but there is no Jaw faculty. -There are two typos of university organization, represented on tho one hand by Oxford, Cambridge, and London, and on tho other by the Scotch universities and tho modern \\'city universities, of which Manchester is a type. \" -The organization of Cambridge is typical of the first class. The university is composed of a number of distinct colleges, each with its 93317°— 16 2 ■ n -•wn teaching staff,, buildings, officers, and property, all united together iit a larger body corporate having its own distinct organiaation and officors, with teaching staff and property. This latter body, known as the University of Cambridge, is alone entitled to eonfor degrees. The university employs a staff of law teachers/ and nearly every college maintains one or more law teachers. In .many instances the samo man holds a position on the university fctaff as woll as on that of the college. Twonty men are omployed by tho colleges and univorsity in the work of logak instruction. Each college looks aftfcr the administrative details of /tho students on its rolls. The work of the various colleges and tho university in law is correlated through a special board made up of representatives of tho university and thef colleges. A chairman selectod for v each year corresponds to thedekn at an Alndrjcan school. | -The organization at Oxford W similar to Cambridge, the work being coordinated by an administfativc board composed of the university staff and certain elected members*^ Tho faculty of law contains 4 professorships, 4 readerships, 1 lectureship, and 10 or more tutors. In the newer universities, with the Exception of the University of London, which in many rospects is moro like Oxford and Cambridge, the organization is similar to that in American universities, with faculties, of law, medicine, otc., each faculty being proaided over by a dean. This form of organization obtains also in the Scottish universities. . -The Law Society . — A preliminary examination is roquired of all students boforo ontoring into articles. To this rule thero aro numer* ous exemptions, as follows: Holders of A. B. or LL. B. degrees of the principal English universities of England and Ireland; or of A. B., LL. B., LL. D., of Scotland; and students who have passed tho pubic or intermediate or matriculation examinations in tho principal taiversities need servo but four years under articles. Tho prelimi* nary examindtioiLof the society is given four times a year in about 20 cities and towfll and covers tho following topics: (a) Writing from dictation; (6) writing short English composition; (c) arithmetic, algebra to simple equations, elementary geometry, Euclid, Bks. I to IV; (d) geography of Europe; (e) history of England; (f) Latin; -ty) any two of the following languages — Latin, Greek, Fronch, Gorman, Spanish, Italian. (May take geometry or algebra and two languages, or both and One language.) This examination represents in content about the equivalent of the first twu years in the better American high schools. -An applicant for Admission to the inns must not be a solicitor or * attorney, a parliamentary *agent, a notary public, receiver under bankruptcy, clerk to accountant, engineer, or surveyor, and must not be engaged in trade or bo an undischarged bankrupt. A certificate of moral character is also required. A -AH applicant#, #ith certain exceptions, must pass a preliminary examination. Students arc exempt from this examination who have passed a public examination at any British university. > -The topics for examination arfe English, Latin, and legal history. Tins examination is less extensive in scope than that prescribed by the law society. The law society\\' requires mathematics and makes # Latin optional, while the council of legal education omits the former I and requires the latter. The examination itself is quite elementary, moro so than that of the law society, representing somewhat less than the equivalent of the first year in the classical course of a good American high school. Most of the applicants come from the univorsitios or tho great public schools like Rugby; so in practice the scope of this examination is of no particular importance. -Goneral entrance examinations are not held by the universities either at Oxford or Cambridge, admission being in the control of the several colleges, but at both institutions general examinations are given to candidates for a degree, whether for the arts degree or degrees in law. At Oxford this first university examination is known as, “responsions,” the corresponding examination at Cambridge being tho so-callod “provious examination/’ In both of these examinations stress is laid on the Greek and Latin classical. In addition to these topics in the previous examination at Cambridge, papers are sot in Paley’s evidences, elementary logic, chomistry, goomotry, arithmetic, elementary algebra, and ajri English essay is required. If the student is* a candidate for the law tripos, ho must pass in ono of tho throe following additional subjects: Mechanics, French, German. In tho responsions examination an additional subject ’■ selected by the candidate from the following list may bo offered:, (1) Greek or Latin historical or philosophical authors; (2) French, German^ or Italian historical or philosophical authors; (3) Bacon’s Novum Organum; (4) Elements of Logic, The Universities of London, Manchester^ Leeds, Sheffield, and Liverpool hold a matrieu. lation examination. That at London embraces English, elementary mathematics, Latin or elementary mechanics, physies, Botany, chemistry. Ono other subject must be selected from an established list. The Universities of Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, and Sheffield -hare the same matriculation examination administered by a joint board. This examination embraces English language and literature, English history, mathematics, and a choice of three, ono of which must be a language, from the following list! (1) Greek, (2) Latin, \\' (3) German, (4) French, (5) mechanics or physics, (6) chemistry, (7) geography, natural history. -The entrance or matriculation examinations of tho other English and Welsh universities correspond closely to those given by the joint board just considered. -Candidates for the degree of LL. B. and B. L. in Scotland are required to possess much more preliminary training than obtains in England and Wales. Candidates for the LL. B. degreo in Glasgow and Edinburgh must hold an arts degreo from a recognizod university. Candidates for the B. L. dogreo must pass the preliminary examination for admission to tho courso for the arts degree, Latin being required. -It will bo noted from the above detailed statement that in tho English schools, including tho schools of tho law society and the inns of court, examinations are required in the English languago and literature, mathematics, Latin, except in the schools having a joint \\'matriculation examination, where, howover, a foreign languago is required. In Scotland a dogroe in arts is required if the applicant is a candidate for a degroe of LL. B. -Examinations by the law socioty and council of legal education for enrollment as solicitors and call to tho bar are given in two parts, called the intermediate and final examination. The intermediate examination of the law society is given four times a year. Articled clerks are eligible to take it after 12 months. Exemptions are allowed for all candidates, who have taken examinations Jor the LL. B. dogroe at the univorsitios of Groat Britain dr honors examinations at Oxford and Cambridge. The oxiunination is based upon readings from some general text, such as Stephens’ Commentaries on the Law of England, and thus constitutes a general eloraontary survey pf the whole field of the law. The noqlogal examination, from which there aro no exemptions, covers the subjects of trust accounts and bookkeeping, quite elementary in character. At the examination in 1013, 62 per cent of the applicants passed in the legal examination and 66 per cent in the nonlegal. The general scope of tho examination ia similar to the examinations in elementary law in American jpiV\\'en as a non professional course. ’ -The intermediate examinations of the council of legal education, f which may be taken at any time after admission to the inns, are also hold four timos each year, papers being set in the following subjects: Roman law, constitutional law and legal history, criminal law and practice, roal property or Hindu and Mohammedan law or RomanDutch law. -/ The oj^ly exemption from this examination is in the case of degree holders whore Roman law was required, or those who have passed on examination in Roman law at a recognized school. The examinaj tion itself is very general in character. In content it is not as broad -very elementary knowledge of Roman law is sufficient to pass the examination. Tho choice roal property and cither Roman[ -f Dutch law or Hindu-Mohaiumoanu law is significant of tho varied character of tho British Empiro and the many systems of law that come under i.ts sway, and also of the fact that many British subjects, -| Hindus mostly, are students of the inns, who, after their call to the bur, practice in various parts of tho Empire. -| The intermediate examination prevails in all the universities of England and Wales united various names. In tho Scottish univor\\' sities the intermediate and final system does not prevail, though tho | student is advised to pursue the subjects first that arc indicted for the intermediate examinations in tho English universities. ^Roman law is a subject in tho intermediate examinations of all the universi[ -; seven; constitutional history irt three; elementary law in one; interj national law in one. No intermediate examination includes real property or criminal law except that of tho inns of court. In the United States all of the first-named subjects would he regarded as nonprofossiomil subjects, id bo taught in tho arts department rather than in tho professional synods, The course in constitutional law is \\\\ essentially an historical bourse, the franio of government of Groat Britain excluding such subjects as constitutional limitations, which is an important Ux pic in^Aincrican law and legal instruction. The intermediate examination is taken after the period of one year in ’ residence, and embraces at Cambridge and Oxford a largo number of nonlcgal subjects in addition to those already indicated. Thus at l Oxford, whero the A. B. degreo is granted, the student must pass in translations from Latin proso authors/ logic, or Bacon’s Novttm Organum. At the other English universities where the degree of LL, D, is granted, the intermediate usually includes some nonlegal topics, as philosophy or economics, logic or political economy or < -The final examinations which precede the call to the bar or the degree, are usually taken at the end of the third year of residence, although the period may bo extended to four oy five years at the option of the student. It is possible for a good student to prepare ior all the examinations in a year and a half of study in the case of the examinations of the professional societies, and two years at Oxford\\' ;> -possible to be called to tho bar, to bo enrolled as a solicitor, or to L secure a degreo in less than three years of registration. Thus at tho inns of court the final examination may bo taken after keeping 6 ;j ( terms, or 1$ years, but a call to the bar requires 12 terms. -The logal subjects ofTered in tho Schools of tho professional societies j and tho universities correspond in the main to tho subjects found in tho curricula of tho law schools of the United States. Topics aro not 1 . so minutely divided for purposes of instruction as in America, equity embracing not only topics that are taught under that name, but tho principles of trusts and quasi-contracts as well. Frequently tho general titlo “mercantile law will embrace bills and notes, sales and contracts. Tho equitable doctrines peculiar to contracts and torts aro usually given as part of those subjects, while in America tho opposite practice prevails. An examination of tho papers set in legal subjects in England and Scotland gives tho improssion that tho courses in law aro much less intensive and thorough than in the best . American schools. Tho lack of division in the topics and tho relative shortness of tho courses suggest the same conclusion. Such a j conclusion, however, can not bo based on tho latter circumstance j alone, owing to the methods of instruction, tho formal lccturo playing a relatively small part in tho law student\\'s education, supplemented as it is by private tuition and individual study. Tho general character of the final examinations is, however, an accurate index of tho preparation expectod. • -The finals in the honor school of jurisprudence at Oxford and the law*tripos at Cambridge are of a high order. It seems to bo admitted that tho standard of honor examinations in theso two universities, from which come\\' tho bulk of university men who go to tho bar \\\\i\\\\ England, is much higher than that of tho professional societies, and j an effort has Wiuxjnade by tho universities to secure exemption from the societies* exammlktdon for their students who have passed the honors examination in phe particular subject. Two royal commissions on university education in London, the Gresham commission of -1895, and the commission headed by Lord Haldane, the present Lord . , Chancellor, reporting in 1913, have indorsed such a plan, but so far it has not met the approval of the professional societies concerned. -The exemption would secure a twofold purpose in the opinion of its advocates, a diminishing of the great number of examinations, and an increase of candidates fpr the bar who havo pursued a university course. . * -The usual baccalaureate degree in law is LL. B. At Cambridge this degree is given to those who successfully pass the law tripos or honors examination in addition to A. B. Thoso who fail to take honors, but pass the special and general examinations, receive the, degree of A. B. merely. Oxford does not grant the LL. B. degree, but graduates in the honors school in jurisprudence receive the A. B. degree. -The first postgraduate degree at Oxford is B. C. L. f requiring a year’s study )>cyond the A. B. degree; the reading for this degree comprises a comprehensive course of legal study, recognition for which was asked of tho professional societies previously referred to. -D. C. L. is conferred after fivo years’ further study, on tho basis of a thesis and examination. Cambridge and Liverpool confer as a second postgraduate degree LL. M. Candidates must be LL. B. of at least one year’s standing. London, Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds, and ^mbridge confer the degree of LL. D. The recipient must bo a graduate of five years’ standing, and tho degree is awarded upon tho basis of a thesis and examination. The thesis is tho essential thing and must indicate distinguished attainment in some branch of logoi learning. No course of study is provided for this degree, and it is not strictly a degree in course. The University of Durham, although it does not maintain courses in law, examines for and confers B. C. L. and D. C. L. -Tho law schools of tho professional societies do not confer degrees, although the school of tho law society maintains a courso preparing students for tho LL. B. examination of the Lmiversity of London. -An extensive system of prizes has been dcvelopod by the univer^ 7 sities, notably Oxford and Cambridge, fqr the purpose of encouraging scholarship. Tho honors school of jurisprudence at Oxford and the law tripos at Cambridge aro based upon special attainments, beyond the ordinary pass degree, both in tho standard and scope of the examination. In addition there aro numerous scholarships and special awards. Both professional societies offer prizes and scholarships. Honor examinations, open to men who have attained a certain standard, are held by tho law society after each final. The subjects covered are the same as in the final, though of a more searching -character. Of the 635 students in 1913 taking the finals, 312, or 49 per cent, took the honors examination, and 55 of these,* or. 17 \\'per cent, passed, indicating a relatively high standard. The awarding of most of the prizes and scholarships offered by the society depends on the result of the honors examinations. The council on legal education likewise holds honors examinations after each final, and on those much depends in the way of prizes and professional arrangements. -Having completed the requisite number of terms in his inn and passed the final examinations, the student is called to the bar by the inn of which he is a member. This is an occasion of some ceremony. The names of those called aro entered on the records of the High Court and the barrister is then authorized to act as an advocate. The solicitor student, having served tho requisite period under articles, passed his final examinations, and filed a statement of his service by the solicitor to whom he was articlod, is given a certificate of admission, which when signed by tho master of the rolls entitles him to enrollment as a solicitor. The total fees exclusive of the fees paid to the solicitor amount to $650. -In Scotland the bar is also divided into two divisions, comprising the society of law agents, or writers to tho signet, comparable in the duties ana privileges to the solicitors in England, and tho faculty of \\'* advocates, similar to tf^barrister. No schools are maintained by these societies and admission is obtained by apprenticeship and examination. -In the case of law agents an apprenticeship of five years is required, except for those holding an arts or law degree from any university in Great Britain and Ireland, when the period of apprenticeship is three years. Holders of tho LL. B. or B. L. degree of any Scottish university, who havo served a three years\\' apprenticeship, are admitted without examination except as to forms of ^ process subject to the qualification. If. Scots law or conveyancing is omitted from tho subjects covered by the degroe, the law examination in tho omitted subjects must be passed. The applicant for admission to the facility of advocates must attain a degree of scholarship as represented by the attainments of the holder of an A. M, degree of a Scottish university or the holders of bachelor of arts degrees from certain other universities recognized by tho dean of the faculty of advocates. If the , applicant has not so graduated, he must pass an examination in ^ Latin, Greek, or (in his option) French, German, 0 * Italian; mathematics or natural philosophy or chemistry; metaphysics and logic * or moral phSosolphy and logic; and the history of the United King dom. -One year after satisfying these requirements the applicant may proceed with his examination in law, provided he has not engaged in any trade or profession during the ypar, either as principal or agent, and, provided further, that ho shall produce evidence of attendance such as is required for a law degree in a class in Scots law, and a class in conveyancing in a Scottish university and evidence of like attendance ill a class of (a) civil law ; (6) philosophy of law and international law, public or private; (c) constitutional law or history in a Scottish university or another university or school as may seem to the dean and council of advocates equivalent thereto, and (d) medical jurisprudence in a university or a school qualifying for university degrees. On the producing of the above evidence, the applicant is examined in the subjects heretofore set out. -If the applicant has obtained the degree of LL. B. from a Scottish university upon an examination on the* subjects stated above, ho is deemed qualified in law without further examination. Applicants are then admitted by vote of the faculty of advocates after defending publicly a thesis assigned from the Pandects by the dean of the advocates. The advocate is entitled to plead in every court in Scotland. The principal law offices of the Crown, the judges of the court of session, and the sheriffs are chosen from the faculty of advocates. -The examinations in both the schools of the professional societies and the universities are conducted by special examiners appointed for the occasion. The instructor who gives the course may be a member of the examining board, though not. necessarily so. This practice is quite tho reverse of tho methods obtaining in tho United States, where the instructor gives the examination in the subject taught by him. Tho English system resembles rather admission to tho bar in most American States, where tho board of examiners haye no part in -the instruction of the persons examined. It is customary for an instructor in one school to act as examiner in another school. -Tho common form of examination in American law schools is by hypothetical questions. This form is sparingly used in Great Britain, particularly in the intermediate examination; somewhat more so in the finals and honors examination. The examination would be % of inordinate length if the hypothetical case wero alone used, because of tho great scope of tho examination. A great deal of narrative matter is demanded, on account of the historical emphasis \\'which characterizes so many of the courses. .Stress is laid on wide reading and information rather than on legal reasoning. -*As to the methods of instruction it is\\'difficult to speak with pre\\' cision. In general, the formal lecture method obtains, a form \\'of teaching that is now little employed in American schools* It is to -be remembered, however, that instruction in Great Britain does not end with the lecture; in fact the lectures are supplemented by an elaborate tutorial system, and the bulk of the work is done under tutors and special coaches/ While the practice of compelling attendance at lectures obtains in many of the newer universities, attendance is not required by the schools of the professional societies or the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Iii addition to the lectures, readings in approved treatises are suggested, and tho examinations aro framed qn the content of such treatises. Cases are not used as the sole basis of instruction, and, when used at all, nrc merely illustrative. The tendency, however, is away from tho formal methods now so largely in vogue. -It seems to be agreed that the best men wlio come into the professions do not os a rule do so through the law courses of tilt universities. Tho reason for tliis is partly duo to-tho fact that tho great academic prizes at Oxford and Cambridge are* in the humanities and mathematics. Tho best-prepared men accordingly go into these subjects, for traditionally tho winners of the big academic prizes have a certain prestige that later on stands them in good stead professionally. It is possible to keep terms at tho inns while in residence at the university, and a year or so of study in chambers in London enables men to pass the rather elementary legal tests. \\'Another reason doubtless is that no credit for the work done at the university, aside from a few T topics, is given by tho professional societies. -Tliis situation is gradually changing, however. Outside of Oxford* and, Cambridge tho number faking law degrees is very small. It is within tho power of tho professional societies to change tho practice by insisting upon higher preliminary training and more thorough legal training. Tho royal commission on university education in London in its report in 1913 strongly advocates a great law school in London whose professors shall engage in scientific work and; teaching, this school to bo connected with a university. The com-\" mission seems to feel that it is a serious drawback to tho law schools of tho professional societies that they are so absolutely separated from general university influences. At present tho bulk of tho law teaching is done by members of the bar in practice, and it seems to be the sentiment of tfie profession that this is tho proper arrangement. It is urged that university teachers are too theoretical; that they are not in a proper position to convey an adequate idea of the law. This atticude is in striking contrast to the continental idea and the growing practice in America of recognizing law teaching as a distinct profession. -One striking point of contrast between the curriculum of the English and American law schools is the attention given to Homan law, and -the general sentiment of teachers and lawyers that a correct understanding of the English Common law can only bo had through tho port fils of the civil law. There is mucji to be said for this attitude and it is recognized by law teachers and legal scholars in America, but so far little progress has been made in offering effective courses, owing to the feeling on the part of students, reflecting tho views of the profession, that such courses are not practical. -Another feature of tho English practice that is of great value and to be commended is the emphasis placed on tho study of the history of tho law. Many doctrines of the common law are not intelligiblo when taken out of the historical setting, a fact which American law teachers appreciate hut are not able as yet to realize in their teachings, owing to the pressure of time and demands for courses in practice. -.The so-called practice courses, so much a feature of American law schools, are notably absent from the curricula of English Schools. This is due in part, no doubt, to tho conviction that such courses can not be effectively given in universities, and in part to the practice of rending in chambers and serving as articled clerks. The English schools are not expected to lit students for active practice while tho American schools arc, and have in many cases carried practice instruction to a length unjustified by the results obtainable, Tho large amount of time given to Roman law and history of law means a very brief course in English law’, far too brief for effective training. \\'American schools err on the other side, and while the training in the common law is admirable in the hotter American schools and in every way superior to* anything that is being done in Great Britain, yet the history of law’, comparative law, and Roman law arc for the most part ignored. Among the many plans suggested for improving legal education in Great Britain, one of the most admirable is to give credit for substantive law courses pursued at the universities, the professional societies confining their activities to instruction in matters of practice. It is believed that this would encourage an extension of the English law courses in the universities and also compel the student to bo trained in matters of practice before entering the profession, something that is not at present required of barristers, though it is of solicitors under the system of articled clerks. Tho present Scotch system carries out this idea in part, since the degree from tho university satisfies the general knowledge of law requirement. In America the desired combination of thorough training in substantive law coupled with familiarity with practice can be worked out through requirement of an office apprenticeship in addition to the law-school training. -The English schools are distinctly inferior to the American schools of the better type in the point of teaching the English law. Yet, -point of efficiency and professional spirit superior to the bar in America. Tho administration of justice in England, particularly in the matter of criminal justice, is more speedy and efficient than in America. For this there arc many reasons, but ono of the most potent lies in\\' tho character of tlm bar itself. This superiority is duo in part to the strong professional spirit, but largely to the thorough general education that in practice precedes tho entry upon legal study and a professional career. Over one-half tho barristers in England are university graduates. One of tho lessons that America can draw from England is the insistence not so much on severe prd*longed jogal trailing for those seeking u leg til career as upon a broad -Skip to main content Search UPLOAD SIGN UP | LOG IN BOOKS VIDEO AUDIO SOFTWARE IMAGESABOUT BLOG PROJECTS HELP DONATE  CONTACT JOBS VOLUNTEER PEOPLE Search Metadata Search text contents Search TV news captions Search radio transcripts Search archived websitesAdvanced SearchSign up for freeLog inFull text of \"Problems in furniture making\"See other formatsv -Principal of Franklin School, Peoria, 111. Formerly Instructor in Manual Arts, Bradley Polytechnic Institute. -THIS book is designed to assist students and amateurs in the construction of simple furniture. It is not a complete treatise on furniture construction, but merely a collection of working drawings to which are added a few suggestions on design, construction and methods of finishing. With few exceptions, all the problems in the book have been worked out by boys of the eighth grade, although in the \"notes on problems\" some have been marked, \"A high school problem.\" The author has found by experience that many members of a class are capable of doing more complex work than the average member, and he hopes that such pupils will find this book especially helpful. While many of these problems are new, some are familiar because of their long use as school projects. These are included, with modifications, as it is difficult to replace them with better ones. -The author is indebted to his many friends who have offered helpful suggestions in the design and selection of problems. Those marked \"F. D. C.\" are in many cases original only in the sense that the general proportions and dimensions are of the author\\'s selection. -The users of this book will be materially assisted in inteipreting the problems by the perspective drawings which ware made by Edwin V. Lawrence of Bradley Polytechnic Institute. -The problems in this book are complete in design in order to give definite ideas of good proportion and harmony of line, but it is hoped that these designs will be modified to suit individual tastes and conditions if there is a desire on the part of individual workers to do so. Therefore the following suggestions on design are given: -1. General lines and proportio7is. The general character of the lines will be largely dependent upon the lines in the pieces of furniture with which the one you are designing is to be associated; there should be a general harmony of line, a re-echo of line, in the room as well as in the single piece of furniture. The general proportions will be determined by the space your piece of furniture is to fill and its use. -2. Construction. The shape of the piece of furniture will generally determine its construction. One will hardly make a mistake in the selection of joints to be v.sed, but there are many forms of some of the principal joints, such as the tenon-and-mortise joint, from which to select. Here, again, one must be governed by that fundamental law of design, viz.; there must be harmony. If the general -design is a severe one, then the protruding form of joint will be appropriate as, for example,. the open or pinned tenon-and-mortise joint instead of the closed one, or the screwed construction instead of the nailed butt joint, etc. -3. Decorative features. Simple carving, upholstering or textile or leather paneling is often the thing needed to give a piece completeness in appearance but ordinarily the good lines, good proportions and good finish are quite sufficient to fulfil all esthetic requirements. The simple modeling of the top or bottom of a post and the introduction of broken or curved lines in some of the rails and stiles is sufficient decoration. -In addition to these three considerations it is desired to call attention to two others dependent upon one or all of these three: -(a) There will constantly arise as one works over a design the question of widths and lengths of certain parts. Some of these will be definite because of the use to which the piece of furniture will be put, but many will be indefinite. These indefinite dimensions may be determined with some degree of accuracy if one will carefully consider the three following laws governing arrangement. -(2) Wider masses and narrower openings should be made near the bottom of a piece instead of near the top to give the feeling of stability. -(b) The satisfactory filling of space areas is often difficult. This is largely a problem in decoration, although it may be one in construction, when the strength of the piece of furniture is an important factor in the design. -The requirements of the individual problem must always serve as the basis for conclusions but the three laws governing arrangement given above and the principle of re-echo or harmony of line will prove helpful guides. -For a more detailed consideration of the principles of design in connection with problems in furniture construction reference is here made to an article by the author on \"Furniture Design\" in the April, 1906, number of the Manual Training Magazine. -It is takenfor granted that the users of this book have had some instruction in the use of tools. It is not proposed, therefore, in this chapter, to dictate in detail any method of using tools, but to give in the few following pages some specific suggestions for the cutting of certain joints and the method of working up stock for certain classes of work, hoping they may be helpful. -It is believed that the working drawings in this book show the method of construction, as a rule. It is supposed that the best method of construction is desired in any piece of furniture, and the author has given what he believes to be the best appropriate method in each individual case. It will be found that the butt joint is used in all pieces where lag screws, blue headed screws or wooden pins are called for. No comment is necessary on these joints except that all ends of butting pieces must be square, and similar pieces of absolutely equal length. It is supposed that in planing stock the workman will establish a joint edge and face side from which all squaring will be done. -is briefly designated, is the principal one used in furniture construction. The one ordinarily used is the closed Tand-M joint, or the one in which the tenon goes only part way into the mortised piece. Usually in furniture the tenon is held in place by gluing, and if the joint is made well the glue will be sufficient to keep the joint tight for many years. It is true that in faetory furniture these joints often loosen in a short time but it is due to careless workmanship and an insufficient amount of glue rather than to the kind of joint. -For the benefit of those who may not be familiar with the process of laying out the tenon-and-mortise joint the following method is suggested. After all pieces are planed to the proper width and thickness and the face sides and joint edges marked, put together in a vice, with joint edges up, the tenon pieces that are to be cut the same length. From the center of one of these pieces (preferably the one nearest the workman) measure each way one-half the distance between the shoulders of tenons (it is supposed here that a tenon is to be cut on each end) and make a point with the end of knife blade. With the try square or carpenter\\'s square and knife, square a line through these points across the joint edges. Now take pieces out ofvice and square around each end from the line already marked on -joint edge, being careful to have the beam of the square always on either/<r« side or joint edge. To measure thickness of tenon lay rule on joint edge of one board and mark points with end of knife blade for tenon thickness. Take the marking gauge and set its stop so that the marker touches one of these points when the stop is firmly pressed against the face side. Before resetting gauge mark all pieces for this width. Now, set marking gauge for other point, again having gauge stop against face side, and proceed as before. If the workman has access to a power saw all the work of cutting the tenons may be done on it, but it is believed that quite as accurate work maybe done with hand saws. Any trimming may be done with chisel and plane after the sawing has been completed. The mortise is laid out and constructed by a similar method. -In most cabinet work, to avoid winding, warping, etc., wide spaces are filled with panels rather than single solid pieces of wood. Three kinds of panels are used:(i) the panel flush on both sides, (2) the panel flush on one side and inset on the other, (3) the panel inset on both sides. The first is used where strength alone is desired, the second where\\' strength and appearance are both necessary. In this case the inset comes on the outside of piece of furniture. The third also is used where ap-The panel, if constructed by hand with a combination plane, should first be carefully layed out with square and marking gauge. It is not necessary in this case, however, to gauge for both sides of groove or tongue as the plane will provide for proper widths of these. However in laying out this joint the same care should.be taken as in laying out the T-and-M joint. Lengths should be measured from the center of the piece each way and all gauging and squaring should be done from face sides and joint edges. If a power saw is used for cutting this joint the face sides and joint edges should always be against saw guides. The work of gauging may be omitted, although, for the beginner, it is recommended. -Where a number of pieces of wood are got out for one piece of furniture it is wise to be very systematic in the method of laying out and sawing up these pieces. The following method is suggested as good: From a complete working drawing of the piece of furniture to be made, make an itemized list of all pieces of wood, putting those together in the list that have equal widths and lengths, and making note of different thicknesses if there are any. Select the stock lumber and cut this up as economically -The cabinet-maker\\'s method of working consists in doing all similar operations on all pieces while tools and machines are set. If this happens to be the cutting of tenons or the boring of mortises be careful to complete this work on all pieces before beginning some other operation. Just what should be done first and what second, and so on, it is difficult to say, but it is always safe to complete all ripping and cross-cutting in getting stock to the roughing dimensions before any hand dressing is done. It is likewise well to have all pieces dressed and finished to drawing dimensions before any joints are layed out and cut. -. One further point to note in the economy of labor is to keep pieces which are to be glued together to form doors, sides of cabinets, etc., in clamps as the work progresses so that when all tool work is done the several parts of the piece of furniture are glued up and ready for the final assembling. -A word about scraping and sandpapering may not be out of place here. The best suggestion one can give in this connection is to do this part of the work thoroughly. Whether each piece should be scraped and sandpapered before any gluing is done or not is an open question. Much time may often be saved by postponing most of this work until the piece of furniture is assembled. -The aim in finishing wood is two-fold: (i) To preserve the wood; (2) to produce an agreeable surface, color and texture. -The old method of filling and varnishing a piece of furniture is still practical, but since the advent of the socalled craft furniture there has been a desire to produce an even-toned color, and staining has seemed to be the most practical method of doing this. t One. can purchase on the market innumerable prepared stains and of these mention is made of the following: Ad-el-lite, prepared by Adams and Eking of Chicago, is a one-coat finish designed to both stain and preserve the wood. Dark Brown Wood Tint, prepared by the Chicago Varnish Co., is a pleasing brown stain over which should be spread a coat of some preservative such as varnish or wax. Old Dutch Finish prepared by the Bridgeport Wood Finishing Co. is a preparation used as a finish and gives a dull wax-like appearance to wood. There are doubtless many others equally satisfactory but these happen to be the ones the author has found reliable and of good qualities for manual training work. -The great objection to any of these prepared finishes, however, is their expense. Below are given several -methods of finishing wood which some experimental and practical experience has demonstrated to be good and, in most cases, comparatively inexpensive. Some of these are old and some are probably new. In giving them let it be understood that good results will be obtained only when the directions are explicitly followed; even then in some cases it may not be possible to get results that are uniform. The same stain on different pieces of the same variety of wood may give slightly different effects. -Perhaps one of the oldest methods of finishing wood and one used today for some work is to fill the grain with two or three coats of boiling hot linseed oil, allowing about twenty-four hours to elapse between applying the coats. The oil serves as a preservative and at the same time, when rubbed often, will give a dark finish. The surface oil evaporates soon, however, so that one cannot rely upon keeping a polish. This method of finishing wood is especially good for porch and yard furniture. -The old method of finishing furniture by rubbing it with beeswax has become popular again. Prepared wax is fairly satisfactory but a wax may be made by cutting up beeswax and mixing with it about one-third its bulk of -turpentine and heating to the boiling point. This should be done in a double boiler. The preparation may be allowed to cool, after which it should be rubbed on and then off with considerable pressure. A more satisfactory method is to apply the wax hot and rub with a soft cloth as it cools. To produce a fine lasting polish three or four coats should be applied, allowing from one to four weeks between applications. A soft cloth should be used in dusting a piece of furniture finished by this process. -A darkened color may be produced artificially on wood by placing it in a tight box and then setting into the box an open dish of concentrated ammonia. The woods most affected by the ammonia fumes are oak, principally quartered oak, and chestnut. The depth of color increases with the time of exposure. A preparation known as \"Fumine\", manufactured by Walter K. Schmidt & Co., of Grand Rapids, Mich., will deepen the color if applied on the wood before it is placed in the fuming box. The fuming should be done after the piece is sandpapered ready for finishing. -For many years one of the most popular methods of finishing furniture was that of filling the grain of the wood with some paste, which might be colored to suit the taste, -and which would harden, and then covering the entire piece with some fixative preparation such as varnish or shellac. There is probably no method of finishing furniture today that preserves the wood better than this one. After the article to be finished has been thoroughly scraped and sandpapered apply some good paste filler, thinned to consistancy of thick cream with boiled linseed oil and turpentine. Put on with brush or piece of cloth and allow it to stand about five minutes until it begins to dry. When this drying begins rub the filler off with a piece of burlap or a handful of shavings. Rub across the grain. After ten or twelve hours apply a coat of hard oil or varnish with a soft brush and let this thoroughly harden. When hard, rub down with fine sandpaper to smooth the surface. Repeat the varnishing and sandpapering three or four times until a perfect surface is produced; then apply another coat of varnish thined more than the former ones and, when hard, rub down with pumice stone and rubbing oil. To give life to the finish continue rubbing w : ith rotten stone and water applied with a piece of burlap drawn over a piece of sheet cork, or a piece of harness maker\\'s felt. -The filling and varnishing method of finishing furniture produces a striking grain with open-giained woods. -If it is desired to fill the grain to produce a smooth surface and yet not show a strong grain, the wood should be stained before ihe filler is applied. A stain of almost any desired color may be obtained by mixing dry colors ground in oil w : ith boiled linseed oil to make a paste and then thining with\\' turpentine. The analine dyes mixed with alcohol or water make satisfactory stains, also. After the piece of furniture has been thoroughly scraped and sandpapered it should be covered with water to raise the grain in order that the stain will not do this when it is put on. After the wood drys rub down with sandpaper and apply stain with cloth. When the stain is dry the piece may be filled and varnished as described under the head of \"Filling and Varnishing.\" -A rich purplish black will be produced on oak or chestnut by covering the wood with a solution of logwood prepared as follows: Boil logwood gum, as it is sold by druggists, in water until a deep black liquid is obtained. About four or five pieces of the gum as large as a walnut boiled in a gallon of water will give about the right color. While the mixture is still boiling hot add about a half tumbler of washing soda and stir until it is dissolved. When solution is cold apply with cloth until desired color is obtained. Finish with wax, shellac or varnish. -A very desirable black may be obtained on almost any wood by thinning Dead Black Japalac with turpentine and applying as stain, rubbing off rapidly as it is applied. This stain does not need to be covered with a preservative. -This is not the prepared finish sold under the same name but a home-made mixture which gives to oak the appearance of great age and similar to the old pieces of German make so much admired. Mix two parts of drop black to one of lamp black with turpentine until a liquid that will just flowis obtained. Add to this enough burnt umber to kill the \"dirty\" black. A very little of the umber will do this. Apply to oak or chestnut after wood has been wet with water and rubbed down with sandpaper. Rub the stain in and off evenly. When dry, cover with a very thin coat of shellac to fix stain, and finish with wax. -This method of finishing wood is spoken of a number of times in this book because it has been successfully handled by the author and is an easy stain to apply. It gives a brick brown color and when rubbed with an oiled -cloth will keep a dull lustre for a long time. Make a strong solution of powdered bichromate of potash in hot water. Prepare wood (oak takes this stain better than any other wood) as before described and apply stain with cloth. Let stained piece stand over night.The yellowish brown crystaline surface which will be found in the morning will turn to the brick brown when rubbed with linseed oil. No finish is necessary over this stain. -A rich chocolate brown may be produced on almost any open-grained or light-colored wood by thinning asphaltum varnish with turpentine and applying with cloth, rubbing rapidly to avoid sticking. If the asphaltum varnish is made very thin it may be applied with brush -and allowed to harden as any varnish will. Unless the varnish is put on rather thick a covering coat of shellac or finishing varnish should be added. -A stain that is easily made and applied with very good results on butternut and chestnut is one which may be made by soaking iron filings in vinegar. The filings or chips should be from cast iron. Soak them in vinegar, stirring occasionally, for a week. Apply in the same manner as other stains. Butternut stained with the acet-ate of iron and rubbed with an oiled cloth will turn very dark — almost black. Chestnut will be made a soft yellowish brown. A wax covering will give life and durability to this stain. Chestnut finished with this stain and afterwards fumed will turn a deeper brown with the characteristic velvet appearance that fuming always gives. -To give a grey stain to oak, boil in a solution of iron sulphate made by dissolving one ounce of chemically pure sulphate of iron crystals for each pound of wood in enough water to entirely cover the wood. Separate the strips of wood with pieces of glass and weight the wood down to insure its being kept under water. About one drachm of sulphuric acid should be added to every gallon of the solution to keep the iron in the form of a sulphate. When dry rub thoroughly with a dry cloth. -A weak solution of silver nitrate on chestnut which is afterwards fumed with the ammonia will give a dark brown. Wax makes a good finish for this stain. -After experimenting for a number of years with wood finishes in manual training woodworking classes, the -author has come to the conclusion that, aside from the few finishes herein described and some of the stains to be found on the market, one can get about as satisfactory results by mixing the dry colors (obtainable at painter\\'s supply houses) with boiled linseed oil and turpentine, as in any other way. A little experimenting will determine the -colors and the quantity of each, to mix together to produce a desired shade. After the mixture of dry colors is made, add enough boiled linseed oil to make paste and thin with turpentine. Apply stain with cloth and finish with varnish or shellac. Rub the fixative preparation . down as described under, \"Filling and Varishing.\" -A seventh or eighth grade problem. This is a very simple yet attractive piece of furniture, and may be made by any boy who has had a little experience with tools. The design may be varied without injury by widening the legs somewhat and using thinner lumber for them. The author believes that roundheaded blued screws will make it a stronger piece of furniture than wooden pins. In order to guard against splintering where the recesses are cut for the legs a hard wood or a close-grained soft wood should be used. If made of hard wood, maple will prove to be a good one, although oak may be used. If oak is used fume and finish with wax. If butternut is used and a dark finish is wanted, use the acetate of iron. -An eighth grade or high school problem. This may be made of pine, poplar, or, if open-grained wood is desired, chestnut or oak. The piece is suitable for porch or inside of house. The decoration on middle slat is suggestive only. Simple veining or relief carving may be used, or the more difficult problem of inlaying may be introduced. -An eighth grade problem; Pine with a strong grain if finished with asphaltum varnish thinned with turpentine and rubbed on to the wood while fresh, will make this an attractive and serviceable piece of porch furniture. It is also suitable for inside use. A dark green stain on poplar will make of this a beautiful library or study jardiniere stand. \"A dead varnish known as \\'Deadlac\\' is very appropriate over the dark green color. -An eighth grade problem. This may be used as a low seat or a foot stool. Make stool of some close-grained soft wood or of oak. In the construction, cut the tenon and mortise joints before tapering the legs. Wind flat pith cane over and around opposite rails. When finishing, stain the entire piece with some good prepared stain such as ad-el-ite, a preparation that does not need a covering of varnish. If oak is used a soft greyish-brown tone may be obtained by fuming the entire stool. -An eighth grade problem. Pine or chestnut will be suitable if this project is undertaken by grade pupils. Oak may be used by high school pupils or those capable of working in hard wood. The problem of framing is a good one here and the weav\\'.ng of the flat pith cane offers a chance to use some originality in the pattern design. Care must be taken not to get the material used for the weaving too tight at first or the last strands will be very difficult to draw through. A long needle made of thin band iron is suitable for the weaving. The edges of frame should be rounded slightly to prevent the cane from breaking. -An eighth grade problem in ordinary framing and upholstery. For the eighth grade pupil chestnut makes a very satisfactory substitute for oak and is much more easily worked than oak. A rich dull brown will be obtained by finishing with a turpentine preparation of raw umber, first made into a thin paste with boiled linseed oil. Wax and apply one coat of very thin shellac to avoid the necessity of rubbing down with sandpaper. -An eighth grade problem. This is a simple problem in tenon-and-mortise framing. Oak or hard pine are recommended as good woods for this project. If chestnut is used the front corner posts should not be severely modeled. The upholstering may be done with leather or its substitute, pantasote. This may be obtained in browns and a dark green. Pad top slightly with excelsior. This is an excellent piece for fuming. -An eighth grade problem. Model top out of a two-inch pine plank after gluing two pieces together. The amount to be scooped out is given in drawing as one-half an inch; it may well be a little more than this. The legs and rails should be made of some wood that will not easily splinter in modeling the sharp corners at the bottom of the legs. Butternut or gum will be satisfactory of the soft woods and oak will probably be the most suitable of the hard woods. Turned legs make an attractive piece. -An eighth grade problem. Chestnut has been used with considerable satisfaction and success in the construction of this project. As indicated in the article by the author in the Manual Training Magazine for April, 1906, there is a chance for study in filling in the sides to make a good panel scheme. It is believed that the horizontal strips alone may be used with much satisfaction if they are placed farther apart near the bottom than those near the top, and not more than four are used on a side. An ordinary shallow tin pan colored by covering with lard oil and heating repeatedly in the fire will make a good bottom. This is a good piece for fuming. -Preferably a high school problem, although eighth grade boys of unusual ability may work it out. If made of soft pine the corner posts may be cut from 2 x 4 in. stock and the center post made from two 2 x 4 in. pieces glued with flat sides together. Soft pine with a good grain finished with a dark stain will make this a very appropriate hall piece. In gluing up, the diagonal cross pieces should be glued into center post before the frame work is glued together; then as the last gluing on the framework is done the center post, with these projecting pieces, will be set inside and the ends slipped into the grooves (where the corners of posts have been sawed out to receive them) and bradded. -An eighth grade or high school problem in gluing and pinning. In gluing pieces together for shelves and sides dowel pins should be used, especially for the sides. Care must be taken when pins are fitted to have the inside of hole for pin cut away enough to allow the inside edge of pin to draw against the upright piece. This will make the shelves firm and substantial. Finish by filling wood — chestnut or oak — and rubbing down two coats of varnish. Hard pine stained will also make an appropriate piece. -A high school problem. Make of oak and finish dark. As this is an outside piece it may well be finished by applying two or three coats of hot boiled linseed oil. The use of shellac or varnish will not be very practical. The corner boards are not necessary for strength. Inasmuch as they are decorative only, some other plan of space decoration may be used. A combination of horizontal and vertical strips is suggested, as in the hall umbrella rack. -An eighth grade or high school problem. Fair problems in gluing (for shelf width) screwing, tenon-and-mortise construction and modeling. The open mortises at the top should be cut from both sides of the rail to insure a good joint. Some close-grained or hard wood should be used for this piece to make of it a strong piece of furnirure. -An eighth grade or high school problem. Butternut finished with acetate of iron made by soaking iron filings in vinegar will make a pleasing piece of furniture. A variety of designs is possible in this project but the one given has proven a popular one in the authors classes. If the corner boards are given a straight taper instead of a compound curve as shown, good results will be obtained. In this case the rails at the top and bottom may very appropriately be changed to straight-line modeling. -A high school problem. The design may be modified and possibly improved by allowing the boards at the ends of the back to taper toward the bottom on the outside, making the width about three and a half inches. The most difficult work comes in making the back which is an ordinary problem in panel framing. A dilute logwood stain on chestnut or oak will give black. -An eighth grade or high school problem. This is a modification of the ordinary form of plate-rack. It harmonizes in its design with the present-day severe style of dining-room furniture. Make of oak or chestnut and finish with the bichromate of potash stain. -An eighth grade or high school problem of severe design but appropriate in a dining room furnished with so called \"craft furniture.\" A variation of the de. sign given may be made by paneling the lower opening. The piece should be finished dark to give the best general effect. If hard pine or oak is used some prepared dark stain will give a good finish. A very pleasing rich yellow brown is obtained on oak by using the bichromate of potash stain. If a deeper brown is wanted, rub the bichromate stain with boiled oil and burnt umber; apply wax or a thin coat of shellac. -A high school problem. Make of oak, preferably, and finish in brown. The doors may be made solid if well seasoned wood is used. The table will be quite as satisfactory in appearance if the shelf is omitted. The doors when let down into the horizontal position serve as shelves for dishes. The ends of cross-bar supports for shelf are recessed into inside corner of legs and put into position as table is glued up. -Poplar or oak will be suitable for this piece. In the. construction of this project different members of the same class may be put to work on the three different panels. If burlap or leather is used for the upper panels it may be fastened on a pine frame to set in flush with rails and stiles, or the marerial may be fastened on the outside with large-headed tacks. An opportunity is here given for some originality in design as these upper panels may be made of embossed or tooled leather, or stensiled burlap. If the wood is oak. some brown or dark green finish will be good. -An eighth grade or high school problem, and an attractive library, study or dining-room hanging piece. The colored glass for doors is in one piece for each door with copper strips (preferably burnished) set in to form part of the decoration, rather than an essential feature in the construction. The project may be simplified by making the back solid, using narrow matched lumber, or by gluing pieces together instead of paneling as suggested in working drawing. Finish dark to contrast with color in glass and with the bright copper strips. -A high school problem. We have introduced in this project the problem of glass paneling and leaded glass work. The back is made in two panels similar to the doors without the middle one-inch stiles. The ends should be glued up first and the case set up as described in notes on music cabinet. -A high school problem in quartered oak. Plain oak or chestnut will be somewhat less attractive in appearance. The front and back panels are fastened in by first boring a five-eighth hole part way through from the inside (as shown by dotted circles in working drawing) and then driving one-inch screws from these holes into corner posts. This makes a very practical problem in paneling and general cabinet-making. Finish by filling and varnishing if a strong grain is desired; otherwise stain, or stain and fill, and apply wax or varnish. -A high school problem in cabinet-making. Make this piece of butternut, black walnut, mahogany or maple. Finish with varnish and rub down three or four coats to give a dull or egg-shell finish. In putting cabinet together glue sides up first; lay one side on floor with inside of side up and set back panel and shelves in position. Now place second side in position and fasten with glue. -A high school problem. This is a novel modificiation of the Morris chair in design. The seat and back should be covered with natnral leather and fastened with large brass or bronze tacks. The leather of the seat should not be stretched very tight at first. A finish similar to the one recommended in the rocking chair is advised here, except that filler and stain may be brown to harmonize in color with the leather. -An eighth grade or high school problem. Make of hard pine, poplar or chestnut unless oak is desired. If poplar or pine is used some good stain that does not need a fixative preparation over it will answer all requirements. The design may be varied by using slats on ends and back instead of the two back boards as shown. If the seat is upholstered with leather or its imitiation, pantasote, allowing a border of the wooden seat about two inches wide to show all around the upholstery, the piece will be somewhat improved in appearance. -A high school problem. This makes a simple chair and one that brings in good framing problems. Hard pine or oak will be most serviceable. If a softer wood than either of these is desired, poplar may be used. In case an opengrained wood is used it should be filled. If the entire wood is to be colored, stain first and fill afterward. The natural wear on a desk chair calls for a finish which will preserve the stain; varnish or shellac should be the covering material. -A high school problem. This is a suitable project for a boy who will take pride in matching the grain of lumber in gluing two pieces together for seat and back. Have the joint come in the center of each of these parts. A very satisfactory way of producing a striking effect is to resaw a piece and double the two parts back as one turns the leaves of a book, and then glue the edges together. Cypress, sycamore or hedge will be suitable woods. Finish in natural color with dull varnish or shellac. -A high school problem. It is advised that this problem be undertaken only by high school pupils of considerable ability. The variety of angles introduced makes the cutting of joints difficult, although not too hard for some pupils of high school grade. The back cushion is left off in the sketch to show the slatted back. The cushions may be made by pupils. Pantasote may be the outside covering. Make a canvas case first and fill with \"Kapok\", a material shipped from India and not as expensive as curled hair. It is suggested that the bottom of corner posts need not be set into rockers, as shown in working drawing, as one will not rock back of the back posts. Stain dark and give the \"Stain, Filler and Varnish Finish.\" -A high school problem. Make of chestnut or oak. Glue up the four sets of corner posts first. Second, glue in shelves and panels which form the backs for shelves, and, last, fit on top and foot board, being careful to have legs plumb and ends of table parallel in order that drawer may slide both ways. Finish in the \"Old Dutch\" style. -A high school problem. This is a very simple table b\\\\it a very good one. Oak should be used although chestnut will give a good finish if a soft wood is desired. In either case, unless one has the facilities for fuming large pieces of work, the wood should be wet after all parts are glued, sandpapered and scraped. When dry, sandpaper again; then stain and fill before the wax, shellac or varnish is used. The bichromate of potash finish will be very attractive on this piece. The drawer pull is made out of one-eighth inch sheet brass or copper. -This is probably the most difficult problem in cabinet-making in this book but the desk may be satisfactorily constructed by high school pupils of unusual ability. The problem of paneling in front and back (the same in each) is a good test of technical skill. The lower part of the front, when lowered to a horizontal position, catches under the middle shelf and forms the writing table. The back and top are fastened in position by method described in the notes on the sewing cabinet. The bichromate of potash finish or some dark stain similai to Ad-el-lite will be suitable. If the stain is one that is on the wood instead of in it a covering of shellac or varnish should be used. -This book consiBts of forty plates bound in heavy cover paper with braes fasteners.

I want to consider now the other side of this question — the objections of some workers against week work. -In course of the months that the General Executive Board has been agitating for week work we have formed a clear idea of the nature of these objections. At meetings I have addressed I have been asked various questions from which I could see where the shoe pinches. Therefore we want -the workers to know that we favor a change only because we have formed the conviction that week work is in all respects the best and most salutary -system for the workers in the trade. If we saw in week work the disadvantages which some think they see therein, we should be the first to advise the workers to vote against it. -At the same time we know precisely the fears of some of the workers — why they cannot perceive that the so-called disadvantages of week work rest on baseless theories and ill-conceived opinions. In most cases such opinions are entertained for the reason that these people have no reliable information as to the week work system we aim to introduce. It is easy to talk of week work replacing piece work. But it is not so simple a matter to grasp thoroughly; for the uniform week work system really involves a sort of revolution in the method of work — ^a reform that is destined to abolish some of the most difficult trade prblems and ultimately bring about a thorough change, in the relations between the workers and the employers in the factories. -Let us first of all consider the objections or apparent disadvantages that some workers find in the change from week work to piece work. We shall take up these objections in detail, subject them to a close analysis and see whether they are as black as they are painted, whether they have any basis in fact. -of meetings was this: Week work would in time develop into task work, for the reason that the employer will pay different wages to his employees; those who will speed up will get higher pay while those failing in .speed will be junable to earn a livelihood. This is only one step removed from task work, and task work is the worst curse of any trade. -They who advance this objection do not understand the fundamisntal points in the system of week work. They do not realize that the introduction of week work will be accompanied by a minimum scale of wages, and the minimum scale of wages will have to be such as to assure to every worker in the trade a living yvage. -To be sure, some workers will get a wage above the minimum. The union cannot limit any advance upward. A highly skilled mechanic of unusual ability will always get more than those of inferior sHilL It pays the employer to pay more to such workers. But this is a question to be decided between the specialist and his employer. If the employer will pay him more it will be because he is worth more than the union scale. The worker of higher skill will indirectly regulate his higher wages in accordance with the minimum union scale. -Those who fear the development of task work seem to imagine that the amount of wages will be controlled by the employer or by the joint action of employer and workers in every shop separately, by a price committee, as at present. If this were the plan of the union they would have ground for fear. Fortunately this is not the case. We propose to get a minimum scale for all the workers in the industry, which means that it will not be possible for any employer to offer a wage below the scale, while it will always be possible for some workers to be paid above the scale. -2. The second objection comes from the same source, from an erroneous conception of the proposed system. The imagined disadvantage is as follows : -At present, under the system of piece work the union insists on equal distribution of work in the slack season, so that every worker can earn something in the dull months. But upon week work being established it will not be so easy to insist on this practice. In the slack time the employer may refuse to divide days and hours among all the workers, fearing a deliberate waste of time by the workers in order to earn more wages; consequently many workers who, in the dull season, earn a few dollars a week will be plunged into idleness. -We have stated this objection as clearly and glaringly as possible because we wish all workers to understand the reasons why some are opposed to week work, and we do not want anyone who is not thoroughly familiar with every angle of the question to vote for or against the change. -Our answer to this serious objection is perhaps not so easy to understand as the objection itself, but it is the truth and therefore worth while examining with close attention. -As already intimated ,week work must be accompanied by a minimum scale of wages. These two principles are like a body with a soul; one without the other cannot be permitted to exist, for it would be useless. -an operator the following course will be pursued : First the number of busy weeks in the year or the extent of the seasons will be determined. The next question will be the amount of earnings required by a worker with a family. Then the union will determine a wage that will enable the average worker to earn enough in the months of the season to enable him to live all the year around. This is the method employed in all season trades where the week work system has been introduced. -Let us take the bricklayers for example. The union found that on an average its members work not more than twenty-six full weeks in the year, about half a week instead of a whole week, and set the minimum wage scale so that a worker can earn in three days sufficiently to enable an average family to live decently for a whole week. The minimum wage of a bricklayer is approximately $8 a day, so that on the average his weekly wages may be said to bd about $23 a week. -When our International Union comes to introduce week work in the cloak trade the same principle will be adopted. We shall figure how much an operator must get every week in the months of the season to enable him to live decently during the entire year. The slack months will be entirely left out of account and the wages of the busy months will have to cover the entire year. -While at this point we want to touch on another fact that everyone should bear in mind in considering the question of week work. We all believe in equal distribution of work in the dull season. The union has waged a prolonged struggle for this principle. But the knowledge that in the slack -months they will all have a part of the work as a result of equal division of work moves the workers to be mild in their demands for prices. They somehow believe that if the empjoyer allows them som^e work in the slack season, they ought to be benevolent to him in the busy time and consent to work for lower prices. And the result is that even in the season they are not paid the proper prices for their work. -Under the week work system this serious defect will vanish. As already stated the union will not consider the scant doles of work in the slack time ; its basis for wages will be the busy time. Secondly, the wage scale will be entirely controlled by the union. The workers of any given shop might feel grateful to their employer for affording them some work in the slack time, but they will not be permitted by the union to reward the employer for this by working at lower rates. i -3. That brings us to the third so-called \"disadvantage\" advanced by some as an argument against week work ; they fear that workers will secretly accept reduced rates in order to obtain jobs and that this will have a bad effect on the entire trade. The fear has its origin in a current rumor that in other trades where the week work systm is established such practices prevail. -themselves but all their fellow workers in the shop. A weak, submissive price committee is apt to ruin the season for all the workers, but when any employee secretly accepts a lower weekly scale he injures himself only. -The trade unions have, in course of years, arrived at Various methods whereby to check certain employers who seek to make underhand deals with their week workers. This crafty contrivance of reducing weekly pay diminishes with every year. Our business agents and higher officials in the Cloakmakers\\' Union know the various employers and individual workers too well to be easily duped. We must also take the psychological factor into account. When there is a fixed wage the honest employer and the intelligent worker will not be tempted to cut it; they will realize that they are doing wrong. But under the present system of price adjustment the reverse is the case — the employer believes it to be his duty as a business man to strive by every means at his disposal to reduce the labor cost as much as possible. Neither do the workers think it wrong to compromise with the employer and \"do him a favor,\" giving him an opportunity to get his work done at smaller cost so as to get him more orders and themselves more work. -The time has never been so ripe, so favorable and convenient for introducing week work in the cloak trade as at present, and I am convinced that if the present opportunity should be neglected our people will rue the day in later years. I do not believe that another such excellent opportunity will occur so soon. The time is ripe and favorable for the following reason: -Owing to the war the worst obstacle in the way of introducing week* work in the cloak trade has disappeared of itself. Before the war the trade harbored all kinds of workers — newly arrived immigrants, half-baked and fully adapted workers. We used to have in the same shop beginners, sixmonthly learners, yearly, two-yearly and ten-yearly mechanics. Cloakmaking is a trade requiring long acquired experience and skill. A knowledge of -operating at a machine or of stitching together a garment does not constitute a cloakmaker. To draw up a scale of wages under those circumstances -This serious difficulty has totally disappeared. Since the last four years there has been no influx of fresh immigrants into the cloak trade. All who are employed at cloakmaking have been at it for at least four years, and four-year workers at cloaks are full-fledged mechanics. There can be no mistake about that. If it is possible to become a lawyer in four years\\' time it is certainly possible to become a qualified cloakmaker in that specified period. -Thus we are now dealing with a trade all the workers of which are fullfledged mechanics, and a workable scale of wages — a scale for all — can be drawn up quickly and quite easily. Possibly some exception will have to be made in some shops, in the case of older people and learners, but this is a mere bagatelle. The trade in general is uniform and will be considered as such by both sides when the weekly scale of wages comes to be drawn up. -And because all the workers in the trade are old hands they will more easily adapt themselves to the weekly system. This could not be said of newly arrived immigrants ; the latter come here with their native health unimpaired and with narrow provincial ideas of earning money, and they plunge into work with all their energy. They neither understand the nature of the shop nor realize the importance of conserving their vital strength. These workers have always preferred piece work to week work because piece work afforded them a possibility of earning more money by harder toil and reckless throwing away of energy. They were prepared to sacrifice their health to increase their earning^. -After a few years\\' time these \"bundle grabbers\" discover their mistake and begin to feel the results of the raging and tearing kind of labor. They begin to value more their healthy regretting their former recklessness. . Then they see that week work is much better for them because they need not hurry beyond their strength and the idea of extra earnings by extra exertion is entirely absent. -Almost all the cloakmakers have been long enough in the trade to discover the truth relating to the danger of working too hard; therefore the argument of \"working harder to earn more\" will not now appeal to them. They will rather be impressed by the advice to conserve their health and -erstwhile dreams that they would eventually succeed in escaping from the shop and becoming employers. This dream had an adverse effect on many of them. They were willing to submit to any sort of system, however injurious to the trade and themselves, if only they saw a possibility of making some money by extra hard work. They cherished the hope that with that money they would become employers and thus eventually secure rest. -Now this dream has vanished. Now it is almost impossible for anyone to become a real manufacturer for the reason that the cheap immigrant labor of former tim^s is not obtainable any more. -The cloakmakers now in the trade know quite well that their place is in the trade, that they are destined to remain in the trade more or less permanently. Therefore It is their business to have their system of work so arranged as to yield them a living wage in return for a natural, human working day. Week work is such a system. -The week worker is always healthier, more at ease and feels securer than the piece worker. He knows his position in the world. He need not worry when starting on a new garment that it will not jrield him enough to earn a week\\'s wages. He need not hurry unduly. He always knows how much his earnings will be and how to order his life accordingly. He can adapt himself to his circumstances because he is thoroughly famiUar with them. -Ask any workers formerly employed on piece work and now having a weekly scale of wages, whether they would change back to the piece system, and their answer would be a blunt refusal. They would regard it a great misfortune to be compelled to return to that system. -Take the tjrpesetters, for instance. We still remember the time when they were employed on piece work. We also remember the fact that when the proposition to change to week work was discussed at their union meetings many of them protested, advancing the same objections as now made by some cloakmakers. Actual practice made them wiser. Now they know that the week work system was a great blessing to them. Under a piece work system the typesetters would never attain a six-hour day at a minimum scale of more than $30 a week in places where not a single day in the year is lost. -All trades where the union is strong, in which the workers enjoy good health and live and work like human beings, have a week work system. In trades having inferior conditions the workers are striving to introduce week work. Experienced union leaders and experienced and thoughtful workers everywhere are for week work. -Cloakmakers, a new, happier period will set in in your trade ; your union will become more powerful, your lives easier and more comfortable when you -m |. . ; ■ .1. ,;. .;. . ; , . t . , \\\\ % , ; , i , { . . | . . } . . ; . . { . . } . 4 . . y . . f . ■!. . t . 4. ■!. i ^ . ■ ! . . | . . f . . i . . i . . y . . } . .t» i}» .{. ^. i}. .}. ■ ! . 4 . f . t \\\\ » . { . d } . t \\\\ t . } . 4 . i } . ■ { . . ! ■ . | . . ! ■ < ■ » ■ { ■ ■ ! ■ ■ ! ■ 4* ■ ! ■ 4 -Pursuant to a decision of the General Executive Board the next biennial convention of our International Union will be held in May, two weeks before the appointed time. -Our constitution provides that the opening of the convention shall take place on the first Monday in June, which is the birthday of our International Union. In June 1918, eighteen years will have elapsed since its formation. Twelve regular conventions have been held in regular time. An exception, however, had to be made in respect of the thirteenth convention. Owing to the prolonged cloak strike of 1916 in New York City, the last convention was held in October, 1916, in Philadelphia. -The next convention will be opened on May 20, and will have to amend the constitution, making a permanent change in the time of all future conventions, for the following reason : -The Buffalo convention of the American Federation of Labor changed the time of meeting from November to June and fixed the second Monday in June as the opening day. (The reasons for the change were stated in detail in the December issue of the Ladies\\' Garment Worker.) Our constitution provides that the delegates from our union to the convention of the American Federation of Labor shall be elected together with all our general officers after all the business of the convention has been disposed of. Our union would thus be deprived of representation at the Federation convention and would be unable to exercise its share of influence on the course of the labor movement to which it is entitled by its membership and standing. -Thus the General Executive Board felt compelled to change the date of our next convention in order to fulfill definite duties to our union and the labor movement. -At the same meeting the General Executive Board decided to submit to a referendum vote of pur entire membership the names of three proposed cities, one of which to be the convention city — Chicago, Baltimore and Boston. -There are various reasons to guide the members in their choice. Some think that Chicago should be selected because this city and cities further West present a large field for our organizing efforts, and holding the next -convention in Chicago woiUd have a beneficial effect on all our locals in that part of the country. Aside from this claim Chicago has ftever had the privilege of an International convention. -Those, on the other hand, who propose Boston or Baltimore claim that since the majority of our locals and members are located in eastern centres the convention should be held in the East. -Both of these claims areentitled to consideration, and we advise our locals and members to take into account the needs and interests of every part of our union and vote for this or that city in accordance with their honest convictions. -The heart-rending cry of the war sufferers of Russia and elsewhere for relief has touched a responsive cord in the heart of the Jewish population of the United States. The workers in our industry have not had time to respond to the special appeal of the relief committees for $5,000,000 to make up the total of $11,000,000 pledged by the Jewish population, because the last month was rather the height of the slack season. -But our people will not hold aloof from this noble endeavor. They will contribute to the relief funds in their own way. -They have decided to give what might be called \"the widow\\'s mite,\" a day\\'s wages, which is not out of their abundance but out of their very needs. -For three and a half years our sisters and brothers across the ocean have been enduring indescribable sufferings. Starvation, exile, bereavement and anguish of soul have been their lot from the beginning of this terrible war. And although our country is involved in the conflagration, we here are still in paradise compared with the hellish state of affairs prevalent in the war zone. Most of our people who hail from those parts can best realize the distressful situation and must stretch out a helping hand. -The decision to offer a day\\'s wages was arrived at last month at a conference of representatives and local executive board members. The speakers at the conference included Jacob Schiff and Louis Marshall, who are intimately connected with the relief work, and also Judge-elect Jacob Panken and Dr. Frank F. Rosenblatt., In order to make the donation as large as possible it was unanimously decided that the day in question shall be Washington\\'s Birthday, February 22 — a recognized legal holiday in the cloak and suit and waist and dress trades. -Washington\\'s Birthday falls in the height of the spring season in these and cognant trades. In past years the manufacturers offered our people double pay for work on this day. As this year the work will be for an urgent and noble purpose — a purpose that must toUch the hearts of the manufacturers as well as the; workers — we hope that the manufacturers will co-operate with us to make the donation the biggest compatible with the wealth-yielding ladies\\' garment industries. We hope that they will willingly pay double time, or, at least, not less than time and a half for the work. As our people agree to give up their entire earnings of that day we hardly doubt whether the manufacturers will grudge the extra pay in view of the noble purpose for which the money will be devoted. -In the meantime we are glad to put on record that many of our members in whose trades Washington\\'s Birthday is not a recognized holiday are already donating a day\\'s wages to this fund, and we appeal to all other locals and members to join this good cause with heart and soul and come generously to the relief of the war sufferers. -How Some American Unions Have Solved the Financial Problem — ^Abolished the System of Assessments; Reduced the Difficulties Connected with the Payment of Dues and Strengthened Their Orgamzation. -Substance of an Address Delivered at the Recent Convention of the Boilermakers* Brotherhood Which Every Trade Unionist, Particularly Active Members Should Read with Attention. -I remember well when at a convention of the Boilermakers\\' International in 1912, I advocated the idea that if your union expected their organization to meet with that success in the industrial field that they hoped, they would have to adopt a financial system that, would provide the necessary revenue, the sinews of war, in order that the membership of the organization could \\'be supported in times of industrial disputes. And I called attention at that time to the fact that an organization that had to depend upon assessments in order to raise its revenue for the purpose of maintaining men on strike was in a hazar<lous position, because the employers feel that where men are living from hand to mouth it is an exceedingly easy matter to starve them into submission. Your organization at that time adopted a higher per capita tax to your International Union. I predicted that with that action would come an increased growth in your organization, that your general conditions of employment would improve, and that you would not need any more of those assessments that create so much discord and are the means through which many members of a trade union allow themselves to be suspended rather than meet those assessments, unless their own members in the immediate locality are involved in the dispute. -Now the fact is that since your convention in 1912 your International Union has not found it necessary to levy any further assessments than the regular dues upon the membership. Consider the further fact that the funds of your International Union have grown and grown until to-day you have many thousands dollars in your International treasury; yet, the fact is that every legitimate expense or benefit to which the -membership of your organization has been entitled, has been paid by your International Union. To-day no one will dispute the fact that the membership of your organization is twice as large, yes, more than half again as large as it was in 1912. From a membership of 16,000 in 1912, you have grown to more than 40,000 in a period of five years; from a union that was continually assessing its members to a union that now has no assessments, to a union that now has a better condition of employment. The delegates to that convention laid a stone in the foundation of this Brotherhood that is really the foundation for the success of this or any other trades union in our time. There is no question of such vital importance to the success of a trades union as the question of finance. A labor union has large expenses. \\' Its income can be derived from but one source, and that is the weekly du^s, the monthly dues, or whatever dt\\\\es are paid by the membership into the locals, and by the locals into the International. -I represent one of the small unions in the trades union movement of our country, but as to strength and power and system of organization and finances, it compares second to none in the trades union movement of our country. Its ability to fight, its ability to support its members, are recognized by trade unionists and employers alike. -Last June we had a convention, and discussed again the question of finance. We changed our financial system. We found that it required a lot of time of our local representatives to collect dues every week from the membership of our union, and so we provided that instead of paying dues weekly, we now pay dues quarterly, four times a year, seven dollars a quarter, -twenty-eight dollars per year. Delegates at our convention said, \"Why, the membership will leave the union.\" I asked them by what right they could say that members would leave our union, because of a slight increase in dues, so that they would pay dues quaj-terly instead of weekly. And I referred to the increased wages and the shorter hours of labor that had been secured in every organized locality under the jurisdiction of our union. And I asked if they thought that the Pattern Makers of this country had no more intelligence than to leave the union that had accomplished so much good as we had for the membership of our union, because it was changing its financial system. We referred the action of our convention to the membership for apprpval, and there was not an action of that convention that was not ratified by a large majority of the membership of our organization. Why? Because our membership realized that they must have a proper financial system. -Now we did 9omething else at that convention with reference to finances. We found as trades unipnists, as workers, that standing as individuals in the industrial world as it exists to-day, we are helpless to negotiate with our employers for any better conditions of employment, and so we organized our local unions. We realized that in order to give to the local unions greater strength and more prestige, something further must be done, and we organized our national union; and to add greater prestige to the national union we organized our international union, in order that the full power and strength of the industry of which we are a part may be banded together in one common brotherhood for the protection and the uplift of the entire industry. And it has been proven that our American Trades Union system is the most successful organization of any trades union movement of any country in the world. Now then, if it be true that this banding together of men in international unions has been a benefit to the worker, our organization decided then that it was equally as advantageous to the organization to combine through the centralization of funds the entire financial resources of our international union into one central point, the headquarters of the international union. -resources will be organized internationally, just the same as your International Union is now organized. Your trade, like my trade and every other trade,* has its bad spots. You may take, for instance, the City of Seattle, Washington. If we go into the City of Seattle, we spend money and wc organize that city, and it becomes a strong, powerful organization. By reason of its large membership, it has accumulated a large fund. I do not believe, as a practical trades unionist, that Seattle should be permitted to keep that money, so long as throughout the western part of New York, and through the northwestern part of Pennsylvania, there exist thousands of boiler makers and other craftsmen unorganized. That money should be expended in the organization of men that are working under conditions as mechanics that do not even compare to-day with the laborer who is digging sewers or repairing streets. If the trades union movement of this country is going to get all that it is supposed to get out of our movement, we must concentrate our financial resources into those parts of the country where no organizations exist. -You must remember, my brothers, that you might be able to establish a condition of employment, by reason of your strength and the power of your organization, in one locality; but if within a few hundred miles of that locality there exists an unorganized locality, where there are thousands of laborers who are working for 25 and 30 cents, as compared with your 50 cents and 75 cents, the day is coming when you must either lift these fellows up to your standard of working conditions or they are going to pull you down to their standard of working conditions. Because the employer cannot compete with the cheap, low paid localities, and if he cannot, it is either a question of going out of business or making a fight against us. And so it is our duty to ourselves, who have taken advantage of organization, as well as our duty to the men who have failed to take advantage of organization, to concentrate our resources to organize those men. And that is what we propose to do in the concentration and centralization of the financial resources of our International Union. -If our union in Chicago, with their 80 cent rate of wages and their eight hour day has thirty thousand dollars in its local treas-ury, and just a few miles away, pattern makers are working for 30 cents, unorganized, either they must come up or the 80 cent man must come down. There are men here from San Francisco who can remember the struggle, and how much their conditions were placed in jeopardy, when they forced from the employers the eight hour day and a rate of wages and in the other manufacturing cities of the Pacific Coast practically an unorganized condition existed, the nine and ten hour day prevailed, and a much lower rate of wages, and their condition was continually in jeopardy. But to-day, that entire coast is practically an organized lo<!ality. Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, are negotiating for higher wages. Our men are asking for $7.00 per day for eight hours. -I believe that now we should as loyal citizens use every honorable effort to bring about conditions without the stoppage of work for a single day in any industry. And if we must strike, we must have our course so steered and our record so clearly established that the burden and responsibility of the strike will rest upon the employers and not upon the men of labor. If it takes a little longer in the negotiations, it won\\'t hurt. It might do good. We will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that we can always quit, but it isn\\'t always so easy to adjust after we have quit. We must be careful, we must protect our interests. We must remember that our great President has said that we are fighting for the maintenance of democracy. Brothers, I say to you. that this world cannot continue to have autocracy and democracy existing at one time; either autocracy must give way to democracy, or democracy must giye way to autocracy. The trades union movement of this country is loyal to our nation at this time in its declaration for the establishment of democracy throughout the world, because we fear that with the gn\"Owth of militarism autocracy will have a stronger hold upon Europe, and we as trades unionists must see to it that if we are engaged in war for the establishment and maintenance of democracy throughout the world, we must insist that we shall have democracy in the industries of our country. -Our movement has done wonders. It has created a feeling and a spirit of fraternity in the hearts and the minds of the workers who have taken advantage of organization. -We have gone on from nothing to a great power, growing stronger each day, improving the conditions in industries each day, bringing about improved legislation for the protection of the workers, whether organized or unorganized, increasing the wage earner\\'s interest in government, increasing his standing in the community, making him a good citizen. -But this labor movement of ours is not yet what it should be. It will not be what it should be until every worker is enrolled as a member of a trades union, and every member of every trades union, instead of sitting home waiting for an international organizer, for a local business agent, to come and organize, shall realize that he as a member of his union, paying his money for its development, should go out and organize every other man that is enjoying its benefits without contributing anything towards its support. And we should give warning to the fellow who does not belong to the union: \"Either join this union or you can no longer gain your livelihood by working at this business.\" -The employer says that it is the closed shop that is un-American. We answer back that it may be what you call th^ closed shop, but it is American. It is in accordance with every act of our legislatures^ state, national and city. They pass ordinances, they pass laws, and they provide a legal department to see that the law is enforced, and men and women pay their share in the running of the municipality, the state or the nation. Upon failure to observe its laws they are immediately haled before a tribunal and sentenced either to a fine or imprisonment or both. And that is American, because we must have laws, and we must have taxation measures, and everything else upon which to run. the government. -Now here we are, as wage earners, realizing that because of the conditions that exist in the industries we must band together, and we must pay out our money for that purpose. Then along comes a free American, with a flag wrapped around him, and he says, \"I have the right to work where, when and under what conditions I please, without being dictated to by your un-American unions.\" And we say, \"Yes. but it is in your interest to join this union,\" and we force him to do it for his own bene-fit, and if he will not do it for his own benefit, we just simply say we are not going to have any barnacles in the trade, and we run him out of the business, just as we take the barnacles off the ship so that it\\'s progress will not be impeded. -Sometimes ^he bosses do not like to recognize the union shop. At the plant of one of the largest employers of pattern makers in this country we had a fellow that would not pay his dues, and I went and told the boss that that fellow wasn\\'t paying his dues, and he said, \"We are not a collecting agency.\" And I said, \"We don\\'t want you to be a collecting agency. All we want is that this man keep his obligations to our organization.\\'* He said, \"We will protect that man in whatever he does.\" I said, \"All right.\" So we finally had to leave the shop. Throufi^ the metal trades organization of that locality, we had a conference, and finally I got another conference with him, and he said to me, \"Now, understand this: That this man will have to pay his dues, but understand this is an open shop.\" I said, \"I don\\'t care what you want to term it, so long as the men in this shop are understood to pay dues into our organization.\\'* And he said, \"we will call it an open shop.\" And I said, \"All right, then, it is an open shop, but it is understood that no one can work here unless he is a contributing member in our union.\" (Laughter.) • -You, the delegates representing the local unions of Boiler Makers and Ship Builders and Helpers throughout the jurisdiction of your International Union, have been sent here to legislate for that un(on. You have been chosen because you are the most active workers in your locality. Your membership has confidence in you. You come here and you hear something advocated that perhaps the membership in your locality might be opposed to, because they, don\\'t understand it like you hear it here. It is your duty as a representative, if you desire to advance the interest of that union, to vote for that legislation and assume the responsibility of leadership, and go back home and tell your men why you did it, and you will find that the rank and file of the trades union movement is anxious to advance and improve the condition of the organization. -I don\\'t believe that men want to keep the unions cheap. Last month I spoke to the Metal Polishers\\' Union, in Cincinnati, at their convention. They revolutionized their -financial system, and as a result it will be a better and greater union. You take an International Union with cheap dues, and you raise it up to at least 50 cents a week. I wouldn\\'t care if 90. per cent, of the membership left the union. I will guarantee that in a period of two to five years it will be a better union, and have more members, more money, more funds than ever. The delegates representing organizations must be willing to assume the responsibility. All I want in any one town is a man who is not afraid of the employer, who has a little •moral courage and a little grit, and I will organize through him any place. We need onls or two men who are willing to bear the brunt of leadership. Then develop them in every locality. Get the grouch into a pleasant frame of mind; bring about a condition of unionism, regardles of what our political opinions may be, regardless of what nation we may come from, regardless of what our religious belief might be. But remember that all workers must be banded together. We must stand shoulder to shoulder as brothers, fighting together, sacrificing together, and winning together in every dispute in which it is necessary to become involved. In your locality, in your international union, bring about harmony; bring about a condition whereby there shall be no internal disputes. The employers* organization has every local union of your trade and ours honeycombed with spies. The employers long ago have learned that they cannot destroy the trades union movement from without, that they must destroy it from within, and so they hire sneaks that come crawling noiselessly, and get up in the meetings and at every opportunity say that the business agent is crooked, that the president is no good, that the International organizeiis and vice-presidents travel around the country and do nothing. When you hear that, as you do hear it in your meetings, put your finger on that fellow. Instead of following his leadership, watch htm closely. -I say to you, that your business agents, your president, your organizers, you vicepresidents, and your International ofHcers, in their entirety, are men who have been taken from your ranks, because they have demonstrated that they have some ability. They are out fighting your fights, they are out meeting the enemy every day and the employer is trying within the union to tow -the seeds of dissension, in order to make men discouraged, disgusted with the organization, and to leave; and then comes decay and destruction. -Men, stand loyal to your officers. What better set of men could you have as your officers, who have brought about this splendid organization of Boiler Makers? -When the Judas Iscariots and the Benedict Arnolds who sold themselves to the manufacturers\\' organization for thirty pieces of silver, attempt to villify and question the character of the officers, general or local, of your orgranization, mark them well, because that is the policy being pursued by these employers\\' organizations. -We have no place in our unions for bickering or for internal dissension. We liave a great struggle with the employing classes of this country. You discourage men who assume the responsibility of leadership when, you continue crying out against them. And, Oh, how much more loyal, how much more energetic the officers could be if only they knew that the membership was back of them to a man, and tha^t what they did would have their loyal support. How many times they must question the wisdom of a movement, because perchance they doubt the loyalty of the membership. How many opportunities are allowed to slip by, because of a lack of interest on the part of the membership! -We are engaged in a great movement, world wide in its character; a movement that has for its purpose the uplift and betterment of the conditions of all mankind, the establishment in reality of democracy in the industries, industrial freedom, the right to. have a say as to the conditions under wiiich we will sell our labor. There is no work in which man can be engaged that is so good for the well-being of society as is the work of the trades unioh movement. We are struggling for the establishment of justice. Slowly, but surely, justice is coming, but it shall not have come in all its fullness so long as the wail of the child is heard above the noise of the machine, so long as the mother must leave her suckling child to go forth in search of bread, so long as special privilege sits enthroned in high places. -The trades union movement of this country aims to eliminate from the face of the earth the last vestige of misery and despair. You and I, each and every one of us, have -our part to play in the great struggle that is now going on. Be loyal to the principles, to the teachings of the trades union movement. Be willing to sacrifice. Uphold the hands of your representatives. Don\\'t be a coward, be a man. Remember that after all is said and done, life here on this earth is but for a short time, and that beyond is the grave, where we will soon be forgotten. Let us resolve that during life we shall be of real service to humanity, so that those who follow after us will have a greater measure of freedom and justice than it was our lot to inherit. -Tacoma, Wash. — Machinists employed in Tacoma garages are paying a costly price for union inactivity. A short time ago they discussed organization, but employers checked this movement by granting the eight-hour day. The machinists were elated over their gain and dropped union agitation. They said a union wasn\\'t necessary. -> < ■ \\' t \\' ■ ! ■ ■ ! \\' ■ ! ■ \\' I \\' ■ > \\' ! ■ ■ > \\' I \\' \\' t \\' \\' t \\' ■ > ■ ■ ! ■ \\' I \\' \\' 1 \\' \\' 1 \\' \\' I \\' ■ ! ■ ■ ! \\' \\' ! ■ \\' ^ * > \\' > By A.

In some circles the decision has been interpreted to mean that labor unions may not organize open shops or call a strike in such shops under certain conditions. Such a decision was almost incredible, for its purpose is to deny to unions their very existence. -The attitude of the Supreme Court recalls the time prior to the French Revolution when progressive radical ideas ruled side by side ¥dth the worst despotism of those times. While radical spirits impelled the people forward a dissolute monarchy with its corrupt court clique shut out the light of thought to keep up tyranny and oppression. -Under the pressure of extraordinary circumstances public opinion has undergone a distinct change in favor of organized labor. Society is opening its eyes to the fact that it really depends on labor for saving the world from its present sad condition. Yet, oblivious to the change in public opinion courts seem to give the impression that the entire world may go forward, but their time-honored views shall lag behind the times. One is reminded of the fanatic who, after it had been demonstrated to him that the esirth revolves around the sun, said that even though the earth\\'s revolution should carry him into the abyss he would not change his opinion. But to come to the point. -Some years ago, when John Mitchell was still president and WiJliam B. Wilson the secretary of the Unfted Mine Workers\\' of America, that union tried to organize the workers of the Hitchman Coal & Coke Company of West Virginia, then an open shop. Upon the application of the company Judge Dayton granted an injunction against the union and its officers, characterizing their organizing work as a conspiracy. -The union appealed to a higher court, and in May, 1914, the Federal Court of Appeals nullified the injunction on the ground that -the United Mine Workers had a right to organize the employees of the said company. The United States Supreme Court, before which the case has been pending ever since, has now reversed the Court of Appeals on the following grounds: -What the defendants were endeavoring to do at the Hitchman mine and neighboring mines was not a bona fide effort to enlarge the membership of the union, since the new members were . not desired or sought except as a means to the end of compelling the owners of the mines to change their methods of operation. -methods pursued by a labor union to organize shops are lawful. If the purpose of the methods is to cause damage to the employer, or even if they have this eflFect, the methods are unlawful. Furthermore, according to this opinion, if employees sign individual agreements with employers the officers inducing these workers to join the union, even though they do not prevent them from completing the time of contract act unlawfully. In this case, the organizer merely persuaded the miners to join the union but has not interefered with their contract obligations. -The decision is fraught with serious consequences for the unions if they will fail to look after their interests. By its terms every union is in a position of a man in robust health whom a doctor forbids inhaling the fresh air and exercising his limbs. Is it possible to comply with orders of this kind, even if given by a so-called doctor? -Clearly there exists a glaring contradictionbetween the new public opinion and the inert doctrines of the courts. -Three of the judges — Justice Holmes, Justice Clark and Justice Brandeis dissented from this opinion. -Last month a federal jury awarded $200,000 to the Bache-Denman syndicate, which sued the United Mine Workers for alleged damages, charging that their properties had been injured to the extent of $2,250,000 as the result of a strike in Sebastian -county in 1914. Suit was started under the Siierman anti-trust act. Under this law the syndicate is entitled to three times the award. The strike was caused by the sjmdicate\\'s attempt to establish non-unionism. The decision, it is said, is the first time a judgment has been obtained against a labor union, and affects the funds of the United Mine Workers as an organization. This case differs from the Danbury hatters\\' case in that there the judgment was obtained against the individual members and not against jthe union as such. -Miner\\'s officials announce they will carry the case to the United States supreme court, if necessary. -The miners charge that the verdict was influenced by Judge Elliott, who called the jury before him after they had been deadlocked and declared that conspiracy charges against the miners had been fully proven. -For a period of six months or more certain manufacturing interests and railroad companies have been spreading the rumor of a shortage of labor, and thousands of women workers have since been filling men\\'s places at hard toil, which formerly only the physical strength of men was thought able to grapple with. -Even in neW York City, where unemployment is still rife, women and girls are now to be seen as subway and car conductors, and it is certain that these women doing men\\'s work do not receive men\\'s pay. -The State Labor Department of New York is conducting a survey of labor conditions to determine whether there is a greater demand or a greater supply of labor. The investigation is being conducted in thirtyseven cities. So far the facts have established that in factories employed on government orders the demand for labor is greater than the supply, while in some places the so-called shortage of labor is a myth. -Clearly, there is a lull in those trades that do not supply the immediate needs of the war. Even in certain branches of the clothing industry there is considerable unemployment. -Last month only some 700 women were reported working in men\\'s places; 300 at tool and instrument making in Rochester and 400 in Klmira. the latter firm, not men-The trade uiyons of the localities stron^^ly protect against the lower pay of these women. In some factories where the men had a weekly scale the women in their places are employed on piece work at low rates. ■ -The report of the commision that President Wilson had sent to investigate labor troubles in Bisbee, Arizona, and places far west, particularly the deportations of strikers and persecutions of union men, contains a scathing denunciation of the unlawful methods and sharp practices of the so-called vigilance committee that carried them out. The commission consisted of Secretary of Labor Wilson, John H. Walker, president of the Illinois State Federation of Labor, and E. P. Marsh, president of the Washington State Federation of Labor. The report reads in part: -The deportation was carried out under the sheriff of Chochise county. It was formally decided upon at a meeting of citizens on the night of July 11, participated in by the managers and other officials of the Copper Queen Consolidated Mining company (Phelps-Dodge corporation, Copper Queen division) and the Calumet and Arizona Mining company. Those who planned and directed the deportation purposely abstained from consulting about their plans either with the United States attorney in Arizona* or the law officers of the state or county, or their own legal advisers. -In order to carry the plans^ for the deportation into successful execution, the leaders in the enterprise utilized the local offices of the Bell Telephone Company and exercised or attempted to exercise a censorship over parts of interstate connections or both the telephone and telegraph lines in order to prevent any knowledge of the deportation reaching the outside world. -In so far as deportations such as we have set forth have not yet been made a federal offense, it is our duty to report to the president the wisdom of recommending to the congress that such occurrences hereafter be made criminal under the federal law to the full extent of the constitutional authority of the federal provemment. -Washington— The federal bureau of labor statistics reports that union wages in loi of the principal trades in 48 leading cities of the United States were 19 per cent, higher in May, 1916, than in 1907. This re-, port has just been issued in bulletin No. 214. -\"Comparing prices the year before the war with prices in August, 191 7, food as a whole advanced 47 per cent. Flour advanced 130 per cent., or more than two and onefourth times the price in August, 191 3; cornmeal advanced 120 per cent^ or nearly as much as flour; potatoes, 87 per cent.; sugar, 77 per cent; lard, 72 per cent., and pork chops, 58 per cent.\" -Assuming, therefore, that wages have risen 20 per cent, the workers, excepting in a few cases, are now 27 per cent, poorer, while those who still work under old wage conditions are 47 per cent, short of income for food and other* necessaries. -000,000 each. There are 14 who have reported having an income of from $3,000,000 to $4,000,000 and 34 who enjoyed incomes ranging from $2,000,000 to $3,000,000. -The street car companies in this city broke the strike of the Street Car Men\\'s Union in the summer of 1916, but it cost them $5,000,000, according to a report issued by the public service commission. This only includes a loss of 100,000,000 passengers during August and September and makes no mention of strikebreakers, guards and private detectives who punched another big hole in the companies\\' bank rolls. -The strike, according to the commission, has educated many people to travel in the subways, and this income is a regular loss to the union-smashing surface lines. -Tens of thousand\\'s of ladies\\' garment workers contributed to the company\\'s loss by walking long distances and riding in jitneys in sympathy with the striking carmen. -The undoubted poverty of the masses is offset by the increase in the number of millionaires, if this is any consolation to the poverty-stricken people. The annual report of the commissioner of internal revenue shows that in the last income taxing year, 1916, the number of American millionaires increased 7,925 over the previous year. -The income tax return^ for the year ending with December, 191 5, showed a grand total of 14,771 millionaires. The returns for the year 1916\\', just published, show that there are 22,696 American millionaires. -These figures are not the result of a census, but are the returns that have yielded the government a very large revenue during the last year, and they may, therefore, be accepted as authentic. It is possible that they are rather under than over the actual number.. -The class of multimillionaires is not so easily estimated. There kre 10 persons in the country who bave an annual income of over $5,000,000 each. Reckoned on the 4 per cent, rate of income, they are worth $125,000,000 each. There are nine persons who were taxed last year for an income of $4,000,000 to $5,000,000. These may be regarded as having fortunes of about $100,-A lull in the fur trade set in towards the . end of November, and this probably was sufficient pretext for the firm of A. Hollander & Son, fur manufacturers, dyers and dressers of Newark, to lockout 600 of their union employees. -This is a contention that has done duty in every strike and lockout of the last half century. Everybody knows that there is not a union in the world so devoid of sense as to make such a demand, and no respectable firm believes that the public believes such a statement, yet the statement is trotted out time after time, sugrgesting that if fiction is repeated often enough it may be accepted as truth. -The real truth is that the Hollander firm sought to deny basic union conditions prevailing in most of the organized trades of the country. Their representatives had several conferences with the representatives of the union for the purpose of renewing the agreement, and when the union representatives refused to allow the substi-tution of the preferential union shop for the strict union shop, which latter means employing union members in good standing, they broke oflf the negotiations and decided on a lockout. -In official circlces of the International Fur Workers\\' Union the opinion is current that Hollander & Son have been cherishing enmity to the union for years. In the strike of 191 5 two strikers were killed by hired guards. Eventually the union won the strike and the victory upset the firm\\'s open shop rule prevalent for twenty-five years. Hollander & Son have never forgiven the union its hard-earned victory and have now gfiven vent to their vjengeful feelings. -It is believed, however, that as soon as normal trade conditions return Messrs. Hollander will be glad to accept the union terms, as the workers have been sufficiently enlightened to understand that to return to work without union control would be little short of slavery. -A striking example of thoughtful union men is presented by the Carpenters\\' Local Union 483, of San Francisco. They seem to believe in an old business principle that no investment, no profits. -Recently their contractors have indorsed the new wage scale of $6.00 a day, whereupon they proceeded to strengthen their local union by raising their monthly dues from $1 to $1.25. This is a sound union principle. The members\\' gain should bring a corresponding gain to the organization. -Announcement is made that the President\\'s mediation commission has settled the southern California oil strike, which involved about 10,000 workers. The eight hour day is provided. There shall be no discrimination and a minimum wage of $4 a day, to be effective as of December i, is established. -San Francisco — A coast-wide strike of electrical workers and telephone girls has been settled by President Wilson\\'s mediation and investigating commission. -Wage increases for girls earning less than $50 a month from $7.60 a week to $9 in large centers; from $7.60 to $8, $8.50 and $8.60 in smaller cities; girls earning more than $50 a month, minimum weekly increase of 50 cents. -Wage increase for men of 1254 per cent., or from $4 to $4.50 for journeymen, and from $2.50 to $2.80 a day for apprentices. -Machinery for disposing of all grievances by mutual adjustment or by United States government arbitrators in each district, by federal immigration commissioners or inspectors, as available. -The appointment of John F. Williams, retired coal operator of Chicago, as arbitrator in any future labor controversies affecting electrical workers and operators on the Pacific coast has been announced by Secretary of Labor Wilson. -San Francisco. — ^The state industrial welfare commission has ordered that no experienced woman or minor employed in a California laundry 6t dry cleaning establishment shall be paid less than $10 a week. Hours of labor are limited to eight a day and 48 a week. -Learners must be paid not less than $8 a week for the first six months, $9 a week for the second and $950 ^or the ensuing three months. -All learners must be registered with the commission not later than two weeks after starting to work. -How the labor power of Germany is being cut down by the war is illustrated by the arrival in this country of two copies of The Grundstein, the weekly organ of the German Building Trade Unions. The issue -of August 4, 191 7, contains a list of 1,044 members of these unions who have fallen on the battlefield, while that of March 17, *9i7» gives the names of 939. About 90 per cent, of the German masons and their helpers are in the military service. -The membership of the Austrian trade unions has been reduced nearly 60 per cent, by the data found in a recent issue of The Gewerkschaft, the official organ of the Austrian Trade Union Commission. On January I, 1917, the members numbered 166,907, of whom 28,907 were women, as against 372,216 men and 42,979 women members on January i, 1914. The total membership on January i, 1915, was 240,681, and on January I, 1916, it was 177,113. -The United Cloth Hat and Cap Makers are having a special convention, which began Sunday, December 30th, in New York City. The recent convention of the American Federation of Labor in Buffalo dealt with the long-standing controversy be-* tween the Cap Makers and the United Hatters of North American on the jurisdiction question of the millinery workers, and decided in favor of the Hatters, giving the national organization of the Cap Makers until April ist to comply with a former decision to surrender the millinery field to the contesting organization. -The millinery industry, which has been the field of a number of very successful organizing campaigns on the part of the Cap Makers, has become a very important part of the Cap Markers\\' organization. The special convention will consider this serious problem and come to a definite decision. -San Francisco— The Janitors\\' Union has started an organizing campaign among women who are being installed in this calling by employers who claim men janitors can not be secured. -Officers of the union claim that there are plenty of men available, and that the reason women are employed is that they are paid 50 per cent, less than the men. When the women are organized the union will insist that they be paid the same wages as is paid men. -As an individual the workman is as helpless as a sapling in a tempest. He may say that he intends to work for whom he pleases for as many hours as he pleases and as much as he pleases, and he may feel that he has a moral right to do so, but he has not. -And then^ again, he should know, as he will sooner or later, perhaps when it is too late, that he must ^sk his employer for leave to work for what he chooses to pay, and for as many hours as he desires. -Organized Labor has been able, through united action and collective bargaining, to shorten the work day, raise wages, and in many ways improve the conditions of the worker; it has prevented reductions in* the pay; it has made the homes better; it has secured better clothes, better food, more ^comforts, and has made the shop, factory and the mine a better place in which to work. -Organized Labor has been the fighting force in state legislatures and in Congress, not only for Labor, but for all men; it has compelled the pasage of laws to protect the health of the workers; to take children from the mill and the factory and place them in school; to limit the hours of labor for women and fix their wages above » living wage; to prevent the loss of lives and limbs, and to compel the payment for injuries to body or health. It has done this and more, more than we can enumerate here. -Every time Organized Labor achieves a victory it not only raises the status of the union man and his family, but of the nonunion man and his family as well. And, on the other hand, when a non-union man takes another worker\\'s place and crushes the union, it lowers the status of all workingmen, non-union and union, who share the degradation of labor. — Ex. -While riding from London to Liverpool in a railway coach it happened that he was alone in the compartment with an Englishman, who appeared to be deeply engrossed in the war news of one of the papers. -(In this department, which is a regular feature of this journal every month, local life and movement is being reported for the information of our members and readers.) -\\'*On December 17 a meeting of the New York members of the General Executive Board was held at the General Office. VicePresidents M. Amdur of Philadelphia and John F. Pierce were also present. -\"President Schlesinger informed the Board that the recent convention of the^ American Federation of Labor had changed the time of the annual conventions from November to June, and in order that the delegates of our International should be able to attend the convention of the Federation it was necessary to change the date of our next convention the opening of which, according to our constitution, takes place on the fipt Monday in June. -\"After due consideration it was unanimously decided that the next convention of our International shall be held beginning Monday, May 20, 1918. -\"As to the question of the convention city it was decided to submit to a referendum vote of all the members the names of the following three cities, Chicago, Baltimore and Boston. -\"It was further decided that the next quarterly meeting of the General Executive Board should be held February 11, 1918, in Toledo, Ohio. This meeting is expected to be quite important and interesting, as many questions to come before the convention will be considered during its deliberations.\" -Secretary Wm. Bloom reports: \"The, regfistration of the membership into Local No. I is in full swing and working smoothly. The workers are coming to the office of the union to settle their complaints; shop meetings and grievances are -being continually taken up, and the organization is fully alive to the problems and demands of the members. We have already over 4,000 members in good standing, and it is safe to assume, judging by the present rush of the operators to the organization, that before the new season has commenced we shall have every man in the trade on the books of the local. -\"The general meeting on Saturday, December 22nd, dealt among other questions, with the question of nominations and elections of new officers, the raising of dues, the week work problem, the question of meeting by sections, etc. The organization is gaining strength and stability and everything points to the establishment of perfect normal conditions in Local No. i in the near future. -\"We are moving to large, handsome headquarters, at 238 Fourth Avenue, between 19th and 20th Streets, where a big loft has been rented and is now being fitted out as a fully equipped union office. The feeling throughout the trade is that the gang of disrupters has been completely beaten and their malignant influence on the membership has been wiped out almost completely.** -\"As indicated in my last report quite a number of our members are working at present in South Framingham, not far from Boston. The slack in our shops is increasing from day to day and thing^s wOuld have gone pretty hard with our men were it not for the brotherly assistance rendered to us by the local unions of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers\\' Union, who are displaying the proper spirit of workers\\' solidarity, consenting to recognize our cards in their shops, notwithstanding the fact that unem-ployment prevails in their trade also, ex-, cepting in the few shops where military garments are made. The same should be said about the raincoat makers, Local No. 7 of our International, who have consented to an exchange of cards with our members and are showing the same spirit of co-operation with our men. These acts have somewhat relieved the crisis of unemployment that is afflicting our men in Boston at present -**We had a \\'recreation\\' evening for our shop chairmen on the 31st of October, at which light refreshments were served and the general conditions of the trade discussed. Our members are gradually becoming trained in the ways of the trade union movement and are constantly gaining experience. Some manufacturers have closed up their shops during the last few months; some of them are trying to cast the blame upon the union, but the workers are too familiar with the tricks of their employers and understand fully that this is only a new device for scaring the workers into submission during the slack period. -\"We had a conference of all the Executive Boards of our local unions on December loth, at which President Schlesinger was present. At this conference we discussed a number of plans regarding the control of the small contracting and \\'cooperation\\' shops, and a committee of twenty active men was appointed to take charge of this problem for the next season. The sentiment for week work is growing very strong and the movement of the International for the introduction of this system in the cloak industry all over the country is welcomed by everybody. A resolution was also adopted to endorse week work for the entire trade. , -\"The Joint Board has decided to engage another man in the office to assist Brother Hurwitz as business agent, in order to exert a better control over the local shops. Brother Hurwitz will act henceforth in the capacity of general organizer for the New England states for the International.\" -good wages, and that makes them feel the present unemployment much more keenly. These hard times will, to a certain extent, serve as a test of the Comparative strength of our union. We have been told that We can boast of a good organization because we have had good seasons right along; if we shall pass over these hard times without any weakening we shall be in a position to say to our brother cloakmakers in other cities that our organization is not sustained merely by plenty of work, but much more by the consciousness that a union should be maintained and kept up under all circumstances, on the strength that it has fulfilled its obligations and met the demands of our workers. -\"We have a number of new plans that we expect to carry through in our organization. They are at present being warmly discussed in all our locals. The most important of these is the creation of a fund for the building of a trade union house for our own purpose. The sentiment for this plan is widespread and we expect that our membership will soon endorse the recommendation of the Joint Board to tax each member with $2.00 for this purpose. -\"Another proposition discussed is the plan to open a co-operative food store, which is being advanced by Local No. 44. The Executive of this local has proved upon many occasions that it can carry out its plans, and there is no reason to doubt that this important undertaking will be successfully prosecuted. There is enough enthusiasm for the proposition among our workers and money will not be lacking to insure its success. -\"Our pressers, who have been promised by the Board of Arbitration that air anS gas irons will be installed in the pressing departments of our shops, have decided not to wait much longer, and to urge the introduction of this reform for the next season. We hope that with the assistance of the Joint Board and President Schlesinger of the International, who is interested in this matter, the pressers will achieve their aim peacefully. -\"It was really a wise step on the part of Vice-President Seidman to move the headquarters of Local No. 100, the White Goods and Waistmakers* Union of Chicago, into the headquarters of the Cloakmakers\\' Union. We are now nearer to each other, and the feeling of fraternity that the cloak-makers have always had towards this local has increased. Brother SchaflFer, who is now managing Local No. loo, is going on with his work in a satisfactory manner, and in my opinion this local will, before long, take its place among the best locals in our International.\" -\"Early last month, at the request of Secretary Baroff, I went to Montreal to try to settle a serious dispute which had arisen between the workers of a shop there and the lo^al Joint Board. I found the facts to be as follows: -\"The workers of the sftop of M. Rother had disobeyed an order of the Joint Board to go down on strike because the firm had decided on a plan of discharging their girl finishers. It appears that the operators of the shop took a very selfish stand in the matter, and did not intend to take chances on their own jobs by supporting the finishers. They openely came out against the decision of the Joint Board and issued a leaflet in which they defended their disloyal act. When I came to Montreal the situation was rather discomforting. I ^t once met with a committee of this shop and soon made clear to them the wrong they had committed. In a repentive mood they went back to the firm and told them that the girls must be reinstated before they would go back to work. The employer turned against them and began looking for strike breakers to fill their places in case they should go down. -\"To-day these men are out on strike. The original decision of the Joint Board is now being carried out, and the operators of Rother\\'^ shop who could have won their point at the beginning without much effort, are now getting the punishment for their disloyal attitude towards the Joint Board. It serves as a good lesson to the Montreal cloakmakers. Whatever the outcome, the workers will know that organization men can not indulge in such amateur pranks, but must act like loyal union men, in accordance with the will of the majority of their fellow workers.*\\' -\"Our union has placed at its helm again an old, tried leader and veteran of the Waist and Dressmakers\\' organization — Brother Sol. Seidman. -\"Vice-President Seidman has yielded to the demand of Local No. 25, and has left his place in Chicago, where, for over st year he had been in charge of the waistmakers\\' organization, Local No. 100, acting for the International, and has come to New York to become the general manager of our local. Brother Seidman has for years been identified with our organization as business agent and manager of the independent department,and his personal abilities and devotion are familiar to our workers. -, \"The organization is at present in the midst of negotiations with the manufacturers\\' association about 25 per cent, increase in wages, a forty-eight hour week work, and a settlement of the much aggravated sub-manufacturing and contracting problems. After a conference with the employers these demands are now waiting for determination by the Arbitration Board which will shortly convene. Certainly the waist and dressmakers feel that their demands are, in view of the intolerably liigh cost of living, perfectly just, and that they will receive consideration and satisfaction.\" The Board of Arbitration it is reported will convene early this month. -Manager Samuel Jacobson writes: \"The Waist and Dressmakers\\' organization of Boston is contemplating a few changes in the existing Protocol agreement between the union and the association. The local is in a flourishing condition, and the control of our union over the waist and dress trade, and lately over the petticoat trade, is redounding to the best interests of the workers. -\"We have communicated with President Schlesinger of the International, and through his efforts we have arranged to confer with the manufacturers on Wednesday, January 2, 1918, to discuss with them the contemplated changes.\" -Miss Sarah Horwitz writes as follows: \"I have been in Worcester several times during the last month, and Brother Jacobson, of Boston, spent a day there with me during last week. Dull times in the shops are bringing on troubles of the usual kind. One employer is continually discharging his help, and taking advantage of the situation, he is revenging himself on the most active members of the Worcester local in his shop. One of the first ones to go was the shop chairlady, who was the most active girl in the place. Brother Jacobson went to Worcester and succeeded in reinstating her. -\"We cannot, howeves, conduct any organized activity because of the dull season. I go to Worcester whenever they call for me and try all in my power to help them along. They know that we are\\' interested in them, and they are very grateful to the International for the assistance that is being rendered to them. They know full well that with the first opportunity the International will endeavor to get better working conditions for them.*\\' -\"In regard to our demands for an extra increase of wages in view of the present extraordinary cost of living, at first the representatives of the manufacturers\\' association proposed grranting the one dollar increase a month or so in advance of time to some of the workers and so ending their obligations to them. But the representatives of the union were unable to accept this offer, because it would have been no improvement whatever. -\"The spokesman of the union at the conferences was President Benj. Schlesinger of our International, and there were associated with him our local manager H. Greenberg, Business Agent Morris Sirota, Ida Kaminsky, Mollie Golub and Carl Zaluck of the Executive Board. Local No. 10, cutters, was represented by Isidor Epstein. Chas. Nagel and Max Israels. The manufacturers\\' association was represented by L. J. Goldbergcr, President; M. Hecker, Manager; I. Luck, Max Borgenicht; S. S. -\"i^ All piece workers employed in the trade shall be given an increase of 10 per cent, beginning January i, 1918. -\"2. All week workjers shall receive an increase of one dollar on January i, 19 18, and an additional one dollar on March i, 1918. -\"This is a great victory for our local, and, in a sense, a great gain for the employers, as it will enable them to proceed with their season\\'s work without trouble and fear of interruption. It is, moreover, a triumph for the principle of peaceful negotiation. -\"The strike of 1916 cannot easily be forgotten by either side. While the workers fought and suffered many weeks rather than return to the shops without the union gaining the right of protecting them, the strike was too costly an affair for the manufacturers to be repeated. -\"Our childrens\\' dressmakers congratulate themselves on this favorable result achieved entirely through organization and union effort and they are grateful to the International and President Schlesinger personally for their valuable assistance. The result, will spur them on to further effort in strengthening the union.\" -\"Local No. 72, of Baltimore, is at last taking on new life. There is a renewal of energy manifest here, particularly since the recent visit of President Schlesinger to our city. The local Joint Board held a very . lively meeting on Wednesday, December I2th, at which plans were made for an organization campaign which is to begin January 2, 1918. Arrangements are being made for the appointment of two local organizers, a man and a woman, to assist in the work. I have no doubt that a few months of the working of the new plan adopted by the Joint Board will show excellent results. -the organization of women workers. The ladies\\' garment trades here are largely composed of Gentile women, who have antiquated ideas about labor unions. We realize that it will take some time and energy to supplant these moss-covered ideas with good, sound progressive thought regarding the true value of organization and of collective bargaining. Those who have been loyal to the local organization during all these trying months are of the opinion that these are favorable times for an organization campaign. -*\\'My work here has been made more difficult by the fact that many of the active members have left the trade and are now engaged in the making of uniforms. This is also true of all t)ie Baltimore locals of the International, but the approach of the regular season in our trades will probably eliminate this difficulty to a considerable extent\" -\"When these lines will appear in print we shall have presented to our manufacturers our new demands. We are going to ask for a forty-eight hour week and for a uniform scale of wages on all parts and sections of our industry. Heretofore an , employer would set his price at the time of hiring, and the union had no opportunity to exert its influence to protect their members because the bargaining was always done between them individually, without the protection of a binding scale of wages, except for learners. The workers are now demanding this change and the union will use all its efforts to obtain it. -\"The agreement with the association expires in two months, and our members expect to have the new agreement written to meet their demands in full. During December, 4 o\\'clock in the afternoon, meetings were held in all the sections in New York and Brooklyn to endorse these demands. Literally every worker in the trade came to these afternoon meetings and all the shops stopped work at that hour. The workers endorsed these proposals with unbounded enthusiasm, as they realize that the proposed reforms safeguard their organization and protect their interests.\" -\"In course of the last seven years I have been with our organization, I have been painfully impressed with the obstinate opposition of some elements in our industry to a united and properly organized union. This antagonism is stronger among the needle workers than among bricklayers* house painters, carpenters, iron workers, etc. You may find among them men who claim to be above the average intellectually. Take for instance, ladies\\' tailors who like to be referred to as artists, designers, and originators of styles. They contribute their mind and energies to making ugliness attractive, by giving perfect lines to the garment, and to beautify and improve upon nature\\'s faults. Still, of all the needle workers, these intellectuals do not see that isolated efforts are not conducive to proper results. They refuse to recognize the wisdom and power of organized and collective action. -\"My experience has taught me that the ladies\\' tailor is a mixture of dreams and egotism. The most radical of them expect that social justice will come to them through the hand of a Providence, and they join the union only when they are nearly sure that they ckn get something from the employer through the organization. As soon as that particular thing is achieved, they drop out of line. Thus, it is pitifully strange but true that the competent tailor, who sould be the leading spirit in the organization is, in the majority of cases, the worst sinner. He is the first to exaggerate the failures and to belittle the gains that the working class makes through the trade union movement. -\"To counteract this influence we need, above all, education. Trade unionism must be brought into the worker\\'s home through well-written\\' literature and it must be done ceaselessly and continually, until conviction penetrates deep into the minds and souls of the men and women who are still out of our organization. We must never get tired of agitating, through pamphlets, papers and magazines, explaining and illustrating the meanihg, possibilities and benefits of the organized labor movement. If we cannot reach all the workers through our meetings, special classes, labor untver-sities, etc., we must employ the use of the mail box. I am sure that in the long run, even the stubborn, whether conservative or ultra radical, tailor, will see his errors, be convinced of the trilth and become a good, straightforward unionist -\"I have spent several weeks in Philadelphia, among the ladies\\' tailors, of whom there are about 500, almost evenly divided in number between Italians and Jews. The ladies\\' tailoring trade is almost completely dead at this time, and only a few tailors are to be found in some places, where a few garments have to be finished. A majority of them are employed in the making of military clothing, and it is very difficult to get them to a meeting. I never had more than fifty present at any of my meetings with them. -\"The majority of them are afraid to join the union. Yet, by proper eflFort, when the season will commence, I am certain that they will become union members. I have organized a group of a dozen Italian tailors into an organization committee. They are gathering the addresses and names of all the tailors in the city in order to enable Local No. 76 to be continually in touch with them. I expect to visit Philadelphia from time to time, and when the season begins we may enroll all of them into the union without much difficulty.\" -Manager Phillip Berman reports: \"Our trade in New York City is in a prosperous condition, and the earnings of the workers are better than before. The majority of our men and women are engaged in making military cemented garments. In fact, we have admitted hundreds of workers of other ladies* garment trades into our shops, and they are working on equal terms with our own people. I wish to deny here, in the name of our local, the calumnies spread by ill wishers of our movement that the raincoat makers are barring International members from their shops. It is not true; the contrary is the case. -\"We had nominations for officers on Saturday, December 22d, and elections will follow in January. As conditions in the local are quite satisfactory and the organ-ization is not disturbed by any trade troubles, the members are devoting a good deal of attention to the elections, and we expect that the most active and disinterested men in our local will be returned to office. -\"Our local participated quite actively in the Jewish War Relief Campaign which has been agitating the Jewish population of this city during the last month. At a special shop chairmen\\'s meeting held in December a 10 per cent tax on the earnings of our workers for one parrticular week was decided upon. Then the International Union soon called the joint Executive Board meeting of all the locals in New York City and decided on the contribution of the earnings of all the members of the International on February 22d, Washington\\'s birthday. Our Executive Board, of course, participated in this meeting and we are confident that we shall contribute no less than $10,000 toward this worthy enterprise. -\"We had a conference with the manufacturers\\' association in our trade, on Wednesday, December i8th, at which President Schlesinger was present. The general situation in the trade was gone over, particularly the prospects for additional government orders for cemented garments in the New York shops. It was pointed out that there was a possibility that owing to an idea of a scarcity of cementers in New York these orders might be unjustly diverted from the New York shops. After the conference President Schlesinger sent the following communication to the association: -I am eager to confirm the statement which I made to you yesterday at our conference, regarding the present trade conditions in the waterproof garment industry and its possible future developments. -Our union is confident that it will be in a position to supply whatever labor may be needed in the cementing, pasting and operating departments of all the New York waterproof garment houses, to meet all emergency demands that may be put upon them by the National Government for war purposes. -You can very safely assure the Government authorities that there will be no delay in making up and delivering all the orders for cemented garments that it may place in your shops. -*The following is a summary of the events during my six weeks in office: The trade is in a satisfactory condition and work is plentiful in all the shops. A considerable proportion of the trade is working on military garments. Our membership has lately increased 30 per cent, and after a campaign for dues which lasted three weeks and which was successfully concluded on December isth, I can report that the entire membership of our local is fully paid up with their dues, and today we have 400 members in good standing on the rolls of the union. -\"We have had during the last two weeks quite an excitable election of officers in the local. Nominations were made on December 5th, and an imposing number of candidates were placed on the ballot for the Executive Board. Elections were held on December 12th, and in spite of very bad weather, a great many members attended. Some of the most active members of the local were elected to office, including Brother Carl Cohen as president and Brother Harry Altman as vice-president. J was reelected manager of the local. -\"We are getting a fair price for our labor. We are even enabled to help our \"brother cloakmakers by allowing them to work on raincoats, until it again becomes busy in their shops. We feel pretty sure that our aid is appreciated by them.\" -Manager M. Weiss reports as follows: \"The situation in the embroidery trade has been stationary for a long time. While we have had a few idle workers in the trade it was not any too busy in the shops, owing to the fact that during the last season or two there was a small demand for embroidery work on waists and dresses. -\"The prospects for the next season are exceedingly bright. The •samples being made in the waist and underwear shops indicate clearly that there will be a big demand for embroidery in the market, and the trade will naturally respond with in-creased activity. The embroidery workers feel sure that they are entitled to higher earnings and a general improvement of conditions in the shops. They have not received any wage increases since their last agreement was signed in 1916, and the high cost of living has Since mounted very high. -\"The union requested the association of the embroidery manufacturers to confer with us concerning d\\'emands for the coming season. At first the association refused to negotiate with the union. They have, however, soon reconsidered their decision when the International officers took up the matter with them. The first conference was held on Tuesday, December i8th, at which President Schlesinger was present. The union presented to the manufacturers a schedule of demands for an increase of earnings amounting to about 25 per cent. These demands were discussed at length and will be taken up for final action at another conference in the hear future. -\"Needless to say, the membership of our local is ready to back up the demands to the fullest extent. The workers in all other trades have materially increased their earnings during the last year in order to meet the critical food and fuel conditions and save themselves and their families from starvation. The embroiderers are entitled to an increase of wages, and they are confident that with the support of the International they will get it.\" -Someone has said in effect that the workers will only then be on the way to freedom when they will learn to manage their affairs on a cooperative basis. The meaning of this is that the workers being organized, will utilize their organization for various purposes, that their union shall become a medium for associating all its members for useful and profitable activities. These ideas hashed across my mind when I visited Philadelphia last month and observed certain undertakings now in course of development in the Waist, Silk Suit and Children\\'s Dressmakers\\' Union, Local No. 15. -In the first place, the union has a library containing a few thousand books on social, political and economic subjects by well known authors, and a paid librarian devotes all his time to this work. -Upon spending a few, hours in the office of the union at 40 North Ninth Street, on a Saturday afternoon, one may notice many young women with books under their arms waiting in line to exchange them in their own library. Adjoining the library is a reading room. Here stands a handsome oblong table surrounded by comfortable arm chairs. In anbther part of the room are two closets filled with tea, coffee, chocolate and sugar, and two young girls sell these articles to members. This is what they call their \"cooperative store,*\\' and the two sales ladies are -the committee appointed by the co-operative society. In a third room the Unity House Committee is discussing plans of raising the necessary funds to complete fixing up the house on the farm purchased by the union to afford its members vacations at nominal cost. When completed, the farm and house will cost some $20,000. The funds for this enterprise are being raised by the sale of unity bonds to members at $2 a piece. -Then there is the Educational Committee arranging lectures and entertainments. The Philadelphia waist makers are thirsting for knowledge and education no less than our members ever3rwhere, and realizing that a thorough knowledge of the co-operative movement is essential to the success of their small enterprise the committee has arranged -a series of four lectures on this subject. .For organized workers any knowledge of the co-operative movement is incomplete without a thorough knowledge of the trade union movement, and so the Educational Committee has also arranged a cohrse of five lectures on the history and problems of Trade Unionism. The lectures will be given in a public school building. A mass meeting will be held on Sunday, January 6, in connection with all these activities to acquaint the members with their workings and enlist their abiding interest. -Every worker, man or woman, wishing to be active in the co-operative enterprise must become a member of the society, and every member buying a unity bond becomes a member of the Unity Circle. Each of these departments has its separate committee, which is a sub-committee of the local Executive Board, and it is the board that manages all the affairs of the union. -The advantages which the local is deriving from its co-operative undertaking are of great value; it has knit the members together and has convinced them that the union can be of use to them not only in their struggles with the employers for higher wages but also as consumers and buyers of commodities. The Unity House experiment of last summer opened their eyes to the fact. -The local also has a sick fund, and every member paying 5 cents weekly is entitled to $5 weekly benefit for a period of six weeks. -More than 500 members take an active part in these undertakings. Every member is free to join any of the groups appealing to him or her. -All these activities afford the members an . opportunity to develop their ability and enterprising spirit and to learn how to manage their affairs and be responsible for their success. They strengthen character and impart self confidence and faith in the power and possibilities of the union. -Our people as a class are idealists, full of enthusiasm, capable of making the largest sacrifices for their convictions and willing to contribute their last cent toward any ob-ject appealing to their sentiments in the name of idealism. A strike, for instance, appeals to our people very much, and they will never tire of fighting; they will endure the worst suffering, but will not give up the struggle so long as there is the slightest hope of victory. We wage the hardest struggles for the recognition of the union. This is an admirable trait of character. But there is this defect: As soon as the object is won the enthusiasm for the union flags, notwithstanding all the suffering endured. -Some, people think that this is because the union satisfies only a part of the workers\\' requirements — the economic and prosaic — while they have to seek satisfaction for the higher and nobler parts of their nature through other social agencies. -I believe that we have made a mistake right at the beginning in limiting the activities of our unions to strikes and shop agitation. Perhaps because our unions were small and insignificant we could not act otherwise. For under those circumstances any undertaking not strictly confined to improvement of conditions was bound to fail. But now when most of our locals have thousands of members in a number of cities, and when every genuine progressive movement, in accord with the principles of the labor movement can secure hundreds of adherents, we should encourage and urge forward every enterprise that can benefit our members. On account of our large membership it is possible to court real success, provided there should be good, reliable management. -All progressive workers appreciate the importance of the economic struggle and the valuable service of the union in improving conditions by every possible means. Only in th^s way will the movement lead to the eventual emancipation of the workers. -Unfortunately many people wait for the social revolution, dreaming of the changed appearance of society the morning after the revolution. They wait for some one to knock at their door and announce the advent of the social revolution. Those, however, who believe that the social revolution is going on, that we are daily participating therein, and it is only a question whether we are participating consciously or unconsciously, must learn to be practical idealists in the union. They must realize that a union is never too small for the biggest nor too big for the smallest. In the union -To the members of Local No. 15 I want to say this: Remember that it is easy to launch an enterprise with enthusiasm but difficult to keep up the enthusiasm after the enterprise has been established. You have begun many activities in your union for which you deserve praise, and it is to be hoped that many of our locals will imitate your example. They will follow you when your activities prove permanently successful, and this renders your responsibility all the greater. -You, sisters and brothers, are experimenting with your union. People are wondering whether a union, of which 85 per cent are young women, will have success in all these undertakings. -*We have in our ranks a large number of skeptics — people who as yet do not understand that the best place to develop the workers\\' spirit of enterprise and educate them in practical work is the union. The union is the place where the worker should learn to be a legislator, an executive member. The union should be the school where the workers can learn to be worthy and capable of ultimately taking over the work and the affairs of the entire community and -In conclusion, I ought to refer to the warm-hearted and generous response of the thousands of men and women of Local No. 15 to the appeal for relief of our unfortunate sisters and brothers in the war zone. When the movement for collecting funds was started in the locals of our International union, Local No. 15, promised to collect among its members $2,500, but the local has actually contributed $5fioo, more than double the amount. These collections were made as follows: The workers pledged half a day\\'s wages, and if these half days in the aggregate amounted for a given shop, let us say, $200^ all the workers engaged on a quantity of work worth in wages $200 and handed over this sum to the union for the relief fund. The same method was followed in every shop. -Such generosity and sacrifice for the ideal is very praiseworthy. I cannot forget the scene of joy and tender sympathy evinced by hundreds of young women and men, most of them seemingly still in their teens, their eyes sparkling and moist with tears, while -listening to the report by Brother Silver, manager of the union, of the sums collected in the shops. The report made them feel proud of their union. The scene was evidence of how a union may be utilized for all kinds of idealist objects, of how it is possible to move the members to sacrifice for such objects as they believe in and appreciate. -Local No. 15 realizes the importance of acquainting its members with the history of the local and has decided to celebrate the third anniversary of its reorganization on April I, 1918, by issuing to its members the history of the local in pamphlet form. -In the November issue of the Ladies\\' Garment Worker Sam Kohn of Baltimore, desires the Educational Committee to answer a number of very pertinent questions as to the way the educational work will be conducted. The first question is: how can we draw indifferent people into such a big plan of courses and classes? -The answer to this is that we can try to rouse them from their indifference by gradual process. If we do not get all of them at once we can get as many of them as possible and the rest will follow in due time. -The second question, how the plan will be worked out in the smaller cities. This, again, is a question of time. -First, the scheme is to be tried in New York City, where the great majority of the i^orkers live and work. It is desirable that every local shall get its local educational committee into harness, appoint an energetic secretary and let him communicate with the general Educational Committee in New York. Every information with regard to starting the work in his city will be placed at his disposal. -The work has been started in New York because here there are greater facilities. The committee has secured public school buildings in various districts, where our educational activities will be carried on. As soon as the experiment in New York City will prove a success we intend to introduce the same activities in the country locals. -The answer to the third question, *liow will the local courses be arranged in the smaller locals?\" is as follows: -To make it possible for anyone to lecture on the history of a certain local, it is necessary that the local educational committee should collect all the information concerning the time and circumstances under which the Local was organized, the number of strikes conducted by the local, the causes of the strikes, the demands submitted to the employers or association of employers, the duration of the strikes, the gains secured, the educational and social activities of the local and other important events connected with the life of a given local. This information might be gathered from the minutes of the executive board and members* meetings and by consulting the older and more active members of the local. -Then entrust all this information to any experienced lecturer on labor and trade unionism in your city, who can be relied on to arrange the material so as to make the lecture interesting and instructive. -The seventh year of the Joint Board of Sanitary Control in the Cloak and Suit and Waist and Dress industries has been marked by a number of new features and achievements. The Board is always forging ahead with some new enterprise for the benefit of all parties in the industry and the health of the workers. -*\\'The industries represented in the Board have abandoned the old \\'public be damned\\' attitude and have given recognition to the interdependence of industry and social welfare, to the paramount interest of the public in industrial, economic and sanitary conditions and to the great importance of the good will of the public to industrial progress. -•The Joint Board of Sanitary Control aims to be the Health Department, the Fire Department and the Labor Department of our industries. It does work that the government, the state and the municipality cannot very well do for every industry.\" -During last year the Joint Board of Sanitary Control has been perfecting its various departments, namely: -T. The department of lire protection In tp( shops and factories in connection with vv\\'ich frequent inspections and re-inspect\\'ons are carried out at regular periods. -2. The department of fire drill, which service is co-operative and paid for by the manufacturers concerned. These drills are conducted monthly in 786 shops, benefiting 32,000 workers, forty-four, per cent, of^ all the workers in the two industries. -4. First aid and nursing service in the waist and dress industry. This department was started some two years ago and has been of great benefit to the women workers. The Dress and Waist Manufacturers\\' Association pays for the services of a nurse, while the Joint Board of Sanitary Control provides first aid kits at cost. It was probably this department that suggested the extension of the Board\\'s health work among the workers in the industry refered to below, for the nurse not only visits the shops -and factories but sees the workers in their homes and in this way discovers slight physical indisposition, which if not attended to promptly is apt to develop into serious complications. -5. Educational Work. All this work of the Board could not be effective unless accompanied by certain information and knowledge which is imparted to the workers as well as manufacturers. Such information is disseminated by every available means of publicity, and particularly by health talks to the workers at their shop meetings. -In this connection the Educational Department is co-operating with the educational agencies of the union. Every Thursday night during the winter, health lectures are given by prominent men sent by the Board, at Public School No. 40, New York, for the waist and dressmakers. -Coming to the subject of its health work — the Board organized a medical division in 1 913. which serves directly three of the biggest locals of the International, Local Nos. 9, 23 and 35. -\"The success of the medical work has led to the establishment during the last year of a Diagnostic and Therapeutic Clinic. Since July ist we not only examine the workers and give them advice, but also give them treatment, arrange for examinations by specialists, and, generally, do the work of an industrial dispensary without the usual atmosphere of the ordinary charitable institution. -\"The Medical Clinic, although at first endowed by the Board, has been for the last three years financially independent of the Board and financed by the Unions taking advantage of its service.\" -7. The latest department of the \\'Joint Board of Sanitary Control — the Dental Clinic — has attracted particular attention on account of its novelty and the cheap, yet efficient service rendered to the workers of the ladies\\' garment industry. To quote the report: -\"The examination of nearly twenty-five thousand workers in our Medical Clinic has shown that about seventy-five per cent, of our workers suffer from serious dental defects, which not only affect the teeth locally. -\"Of the seventy-five per cent, of the workers suffering from dental defects, only a comparatively insigni6cant number were shown to have remedied the defects by proper dentistry. Most of the others have either entirely neglected the dental defects or have had their teelh treated ity the ordinary cheap dentists who, instead of correcting the defects, made them worse by gold capping, bridges and various other faulty dental work. The workers not only were compelled to pay exorbitant sums for attention to their teeth, but this expenditure of money actually did them greater harm than good. ... -The Dental Clinic is completely equipped with four chairs. X-ray apparatus, etc., and since its opening has been popular with the workers and successful financially, in that it pays its expenses. -\"The work done in the clinic 19 not only prophylactic and clinical, but also educational, as it not only corrects but also seeks to educate the workers in taking proper care of the teeth and mouth and thus promote their general health. -\"On October ist the clinic has been reorganized with a staff of four very able and competent dentists under a Dental Director and we have been treating nearly one hundred and fifty patients a week, with an io-\"In our Dental Clinic, which has been equipped with the most modern appliances and has been commended by members of the National Dental Association as unique in many respects, we have been for the last six months practicing modern scientific dentistry in an ethical way, with charges to the workers based on cost, -\"The Dental Clinic has been in existence twenty-four weeks, has treated over six hundred individual patients, has on the average treated one hundred patients a week, ami haa taken in about one hundred dollars -\\' come during October of about $650.00. The clinic still shows a small deficit but we hope this will disappear within a short -That the Joint Board of Sanitary Control is forging ahead, striving to serve the sanitary and health interests of all who spend time and service in the industry is shown from the new department opened on January 5, 1918 — a Nose, Throat and Ear Department of the Medical Division. It will be open every Saturday from I p. m. to 3 -Both were elderly, gray-haired people. The only difference was the wrinkled and yellowish face of the woman, her eyes devoid of fire and life, and the ruddy complexion and bright, lively eyes of the man. I noticed the difference as soon as I entered. These elderly people seldom* come here. The quarrels and differences occur mostly among the younger couples. Old people with one foot on the brink of the gfrave don\\'t quarrel. However hard and full of troubles life is for them the long years of living together must even out their character and engender mutual peace and devotion. This elderly couple, however, confronted each other with hate and angry glances. -An audible murmur filled the room. Some laughed aloud. There were many present who had not yet reached that age. -The man uttered a mocking\\' laugh, as if he had heard the most comical thing, and his sardonic smile did not forsake him, even when he took the witness stand. -\"Yes sir, a thief. She was a thief and will remain so until her death. I will not live with her any longer under one roof. I\\'ve suffered enough at her hands.\" -no careless rigmarole. It seemed to have been based on solid fact. His demeanor impressed^ all present because he evincpd firmness, pride and certainty. She, on the other hand, sat in a corner crying, her head supported by her hands — the best evidence of guilt. -\"I shall ask you to tell the whole story,\" the old judge said commandingly, casting a side glance at the old woman. -Ever since he had married he had not lost a day\\'s work. He was receiving the highest wages, being a skilled mechanic. Employers vied with each other to secure his services. In this regard he had nothing to complain of, yet his lot was less enviable than that of other workers in the same shop. They were always having some money with them, coming and going as they wished. He, however, had never a cent with him. She had always taken away his last penny, and he had to ask her for the pettiest allowsLnces. -At first it had not appeared to him so strange. He had rather liked the idea. A brave little woman, he had thought; she\\' knew how to handle money. Besides, he had been young and foolish and everything had seemed well and good. In later years he had come to see that this was not the right way. While his friends had spent the time happily at balls and picnics, treating each other at bars to their hearts\\' content, he alone had had no money to spend on such things. His friends had laughed at his being henpecked by his wife and had called him humiliating names. One day he had proposed to take a part of his earnings for spending money, insisting that he had a right to live like other men of his station in life. But at this a serious family row had broken out. In a shrill, domineering voice she had put her foot down on the proposition. He should do nothing of the kind.She had ruled once and for all, and nothing should unbend her from her set purpose, and to clinch the matter she had told him in plain words that all he possessed was hers. -Alter this he had taken to concealing petty sums, but she had unearthed them, carefully searching in all coiners and turning out his pockets. It was for his good, she had declared. Going to a ball would do him no good; as for a glass of beer — that was surely poison for him. Better and healthier by far to stay at home. He continued: -\"In all the long years of hard work I saved up a gold watch — I paid for it $136. I have had it for eighteen years, and it has become part of my life, like my own hand. I cannot live without it. On Sundays and holidays I must carry it along with me. The habit has become my second nature. Somehow I feel happier when the gold chain wobbles about my person; it makes me feel more manly. She knows this very well, and started punishing me by hiding the watch. For the least thing the watch disappears and I have to swear to her by all that is holy to be good and obey her to have the Nvatch back again. -\"Some months ago I happened to come home rather \\'jolly.\\' We had a party in the shop and all had several drinks. How could I stand aside from the others? True, it cost me $5, but what of it? And when I came home I faced \\'some music\\' that made one reel with pain and shame. By appeai\\'ance she is a very quiet person, but when she gets excited she vomits fire and brimstone, roars like lions and tigers until one\\'s very life is in danger. The result was that she took my watch away and has not returned it. She says that she threw it into the river, but I know that was not * true. I begged her with tears in my eyes to return it to me. I promised to be good, but it was no use. Maybe she pawned it or perhaps she really threw it into the river. -\\'\\'This I could not stand any longer and went to live with my sister. That is all, your Honor, I have to say.\" -\"Yes sir, I did take it away, but let him tell me straight to the face that it was his; indeed, let him tell me that.\" -\"Well, why don\\'t you speak? Is it yours?\" and, as he\\' did not reply, she turned to tjj^e judge triumphantly: -\"Your Honor, I\\'ve not pawned the watch nor thrown it into the river. I have it with me. Here it is,\" and saying this, she pulled from her bosom a large shining watch suspended from a thick long chain. When the old man saw it he jumped up with joy, stretched out his hands to the watch and uttered a shriek. -\"But it is not his, your Honor. I bought the watch. I \\'ve scraped every penny together until I got the $136. I\\'ve never bought myself a dress; never went to the theater or a ball. Day and night I stayed at home and tried to make it nice for him and the child, that they should not be short of anything. Do you know, your Honor, what it means to bring up a child, provide it with clothes, have it educated and care for it until it grows up? Do you know how hard this is for a family of working people? I\\'ve brought up a good daughter, had her taught and educated. She is happy now, for through her education she was able to get a good husband; and besides all this, look at my husband, how well he looks. Do you know, he is already sixty-two years old, and I am eight years younger. Yet how young and fresh he looks and how worn and shrivelled I am. That\\'s because I made up my mind right at first that my husband should not go to saloons and be out with company all night long. He is a working man, working hard, and should have a good home, regular meals and proper sleep. I know what it means when working men start drinking, how quickly they get ruined and die before their time, and J would not have it. -\"Yes, I bought the watch. He hasn\\'t even dreamt of such a thing. It was the present I gave him in the tenth year of our being married. It was quite a surprise. It pleased him; it made him as joyful as a child, and I told him there and then that so long as he will keep himself like a man -Organization and leadership rule the world. The organized worker is no longer a slave to the whims of the master. -Since the dawn of civilization the fate of the downtrodden has depended upon two great factors — organization and leadership. -But gradually through their bitter experience the workers were taught the two great lessons of life: that the primal rights of man and decencies of life — labor with dignity, health and safety, the comfortable home, the sheltered and unbroken family circle, education and recreation — ^are not automatic rewards for the good \\'and merit\\' orious individual, are not let down from heaven or the State, but must be wrung from privilege and interest; and, secondly, that in the struggle for these things the individual is nothing — the group is all. For what power has the >individual against the State, and what force the one worker against the master of hundreds of thousands? -Then began the organization of the workers for the workers, and so dawned a new era of hope and betterment for the men oi labor. But for long the new struggle was ^ almost fruitless. The lesson had not been all learned. Organization alone, it was found, could eflfcct little, either under the rule of legal restriction or the freedom of competition and bargaining. Without skilled and trusted representatives of their own, trained leadership drawn from the men of toil, the workers were still helpless. Men they needed who had suffered with them, -men of force and experience who had learned the intricacies and subtleties of trade at^d politics, to unify the workers\\' viewpoint,\\' to unite the scattered organic groups, who could meet craft with craft, special knowledge with special knowledge, and backed by the solid array of millions of united men, could defy the threat of force and the unjust manipulation of the law. -It is the proudest boast of labor and the greatest cause for cheer that out of this need and stress such leaders arose that in the main they have proved true to their comrades and the cause, and that the rank and file under their guidance are fast learning the lessons of solidarity, discipline and the necessity of good leadership. -To-day, as in the past, organization and leadership rule the world. But to-day, as never before, we behold organization and leadership of the workers, by the workers, and for the workers. Of the outcome there can be no doubt. No longer is the organized worker a slave to the whim of the master, dependent for his bread upon subserviency under driving and insult, but a man dignified by the consciousnes of rights recognized and sustained, for he has practically won already a right to his job, a living x wage. -It needs now no prophetic eye to see the time not far distant when autocracy shall have been driven from its last stand; when democracy in governmnet and industry shall prevail; when dignity, security and comfort shall be the lot of all who toil; when organized labor shall have triumphed. -the watch will be his, but as soon as he will start to drink I will take it away. He promised to be good and he kept his word for a long time. I don\\'t complain of the past. Some times we had a few words, but this is only human, no great misfortune. But two months ago he came home dead drunk. He spent $5, and when I spoke to him about it he was going to strike me and insulted me, calling me all sorts of names. He said that Tve annoyed him all his life and he would not look at me any more; that he was tired of me. What then was I to do, keep quiet? Oh, no. He insulted and hurt me too much. I simply took the watch away. That was our agree-\"Let him give me support. Tve deserved it. If not for me, he would perhaps be dead now. I am old and weak and cannot work. Let him pay for all the good I\\'ve done to him,\" she concluded sobbing. -\"But my watch — ^let her return me my watch, the old man cried beside himself, I will be good, but let her return me my watch,\" the old man cried beside himself, stretching out his hands to the old woman. -After a brief conversation in a separate room the couple came out arm in arm in . friendly fashion, bowing in gratitude to the old judge, who regarded them smiling good-humoredly. -contains editorials on the most important Problems in the Ladies\\' Garment Industry and the labor movement in general -Monthly Reports of the Activities of the Different Local Unions of the I.

Our own conventions in recent years have been very important, each in its own way. Our next convention, the fourteenth in the history of our International, will likewise have its special significance. -The convention will be held at a time when the world is in the pangs of birth. All civilized countries seem to be travailing in pain — a new order is slowly and painfully being evolved from the destruction and confusion of the present system. Capitalism has practically broken down. It has proved incompetent, because too selfish, to conduct the great national industries in a great world crisis. Instead of helping to surmount the crisis, it has proved a hindrance, and governments had to step in, push aside private enterprise in the largest and most important industries, and take them under their own control. -In taking over these industries, the governments of the countries where private enterprise had ruled unchecked perceived somewhat reluctantly that national welfare depends on the working people ; that to preserve their integrity and save themselves from threatening disaster they must live in peace with the organized workers and improve their conditions of labor. This change in the conception of the worthy part performed by labor in the preservation of Society is taking place even in our own great country. It is now entirely up to the workers themselves whether this change should be further evolved and completed. -The spirit of the time is such as to make every worker thoughtful and conscious of the aim and direction of the labor movement. It is certain that our fourteenth convention, which will begin its sessions in Boston on Monday, May 20,\\'will similarly derive inspiration from the stirring times in which we live. The most important questions before the convention should be regarded in this light: namely, that labor has risen in the scale and has become an estimable factor in our national life. The workers in our industry are also in a position to effect a better future for themselves, if they will only realize that to do so they must be completely organized, presenting a solid front. -In the seventeen months that have elapsed since the last convention in Philadelphia many notable events have occurred. In the first few months we conducted a series of organizing campaigns in various parts of the coun-try to draw the unorganized into line. Our General Executive Board has endeavored, as far as possible, to carry out the resolution of the Philadelphia convention, and has spared neither money nor effort to ameliorate the condition of our people in a number of cities and branches of industry. -In New York almost all of our locals, with our co-operation and support, won increases in wages, in most cases, by negotiation in conference. The cloakmakers, waist and dressmakers, children\\'s dressmakers, whitegoods workers, ladies\\' tailors, raincoat makers, kimono and house-dress workers — in all these trades the workers have improved and strengthened their economic position. -In cities out of New York our local unions have put on record similar achievements. In Cincinnati and Toronto we achieved notable victories. In Philadelphia the cloak-makers and waist-makers improved their position. In Chicago we had a great moral victory in spite of a systematic persecution and prosecution conducted by a powerful trio — the employers, the police and injunction judges. Our Local No. 100, consisting of skirt, waist, dress, kimono, and white-goods workers, renewed its existence and has become a factor in the industry, although officially we did not win the strike. In Montreal we conducted an up-hill stnfggle and achieved a partial victory — partial because the strike lasted the entire season. In other cities — Baltimore, Cleveland, St. Louis and elsewhere — ^we have kept up our agitation, calling the unorganized to unity and organization. In Boston we put our cloakmakers\\' locals through a purifying process and placed the organization in a salutary atmosphere. Several months ago the petticoat makers of that city won a strike and joined the Waistmakers\\' Union, Local No. 49, in large number. -During the interval circumstances occurred requiring exceptionally drastic measures resorted to for the first time in the history of our International Union. We mean the trouble with the cloak operators of New York as a result of which the General Executive Board felt in duty bound to reorganize the Cloak Operators\\' Union, Local No. 1, root and branch. For a long time the canker grew, causing pain and unrest in the ranks of the cloakmakers. Finally the General Executive Board performed the necessary operation. The cankerous growth was cut out by the roots, and the new Local No. 1 grafted in the place of the old one exhibits every sign of healthy, normal growth and is full of future promise. -The elected delegates will come to the convention conscious of the fact that the organization has difficult problems to solve for the near future, but is free from internal disorder, and that it enjoyes a high prestige, not only in our industry, but in the public opinion of the country at large. -In accordance with a decision of the General Executive Board, President Schlesinger will visit all the locals in course of the next two months, \\\\vith a view to studying at first hand their associated life, their condition and their future prospects. Subsequently he will embody his impressions in the report of the General Executive Board to the convention, together with appropriate and needful recommendations looking to the promotion of their welfare and the welfare of the organization as a whole. -As already alluded to, our organization is confronted with certain problems of far-reaching importance, and the fourteenth convention will be called upon to find their true solution. It is, therefore, desirable that our locals should take them into serious consideration, so that the delegates to be elected by them shall be properly informed upon the questions to be dealt with in order to discuss them with cool deliberation, as it is essential that these questions shall be decided with justice and fairness and for the benefit of all concerned. -One of these questions is the introduction of week work and a minimum wage in the cloak trade and other trades, as far as possible and practicable. An agitation for week work among the cloakmakers of New York has been in progress for a considerable time. In the last few months the question has been dealt with editorially in the Ladies\\' Garment Worker. In those editorial articles President Schlesinger discussed the subject from every angle and with profound conviction. They who read the articles have felt that week work is an urgent and pressing reform; that week work will place the trade on a normal, sound basis, will deliver the piece workers from a slavish yoke they have fastened upon themselves and remedy many evils in the shops. Just as the abolition of home work in 1910 brought rest and freedom to the workers and their families, so the abolition of piece work will bring ease of mind and less anxiety. Week work will mean almost an industrial revolution and a new, healthier atmosphere within the organization. Many cloak operators and finishers are already working week work. The convention will have to decide the question once for all, and it is possible that the next fall season will see the ideal of week work fully realized. -Another important point is the ever-recurrent question of organization, which absorbs much time at every convention. In the last few years there have been many economic disturbances in our industries and consequent poor seasons for the workers. At the present time, however, all our people are working full time. This shows that the condition of the industry is becoming normal again. It is certain that in the next two years there will be a shortage of labor in the ladies\\' garment trades all over the country. Such circumstances are highly favorable for organizing work on a large scale. Under such circumstances the American workers in \\' a number of trades have extended their ranks. -This vexed question has been worrying us for a number of years. So long ago as in 1910, at the convention then also held in Boston, the close connection between successful organizing work and ample financial resources had been definitely established; and we have since been hammering away at the point that if our International should have to solicit donations in every protracted strike, it would be more advisable to have no such strikes. -As soon as organizing work is begun in any new field we must be prepared to meet all the cost incidental to every strike and be prepared to wage strikes with stubborn employers, perhaps for weeks and months. Thus the question of organization, from beginning to end, resolves itself into a question of finances. Let us hope that the fourteenth convention in Boston will make a serious attempt to solve the organization question. -Last month our International Union succeeded in securing for the ladies\\' garment industry an exemption which attracted wide attention. This was, namely, the permission which our President Schlesinger, with the assistance of President Gompers of the American Federation of Labor, received from Dr. Garfield, the Federal Fuel Administrator, exempting the ladies* garment industry from the operation of the hcatless and lightless order and thus enabling our people to work on the proscribed Mondays. -The International Ladies\\' Garment Workers* Union respectfully requests that the order of the Fuel Administration dated January 17th, 1918, be amended either by wholly excepting all manufacturing plants engaged exclusively in the production of women\\'s apparel from the operation of said order with reference to the remaining Mondays between January 28th and March 25th, 1918, or at least by substituting Saturdays for such Mondays, and in support of its request the Union submits the following facts and reasons: -The women\\'s wear industry in the United States employs about two hundred and fifty thousand workers, almost all of whom are located within the section of the country affected by the order of the Fuel Administrator. Of this number more than half are members of the International Ladies\\' Garment Workers\\' Union. -The principal branches of the industry are the cloak and suit industry, which employs about half of the total number of workers, the waist and dress, underwear, and similar industries. -The center of the industry is the City of New York, which employs about one hundred thousand workers in approximately forty-five hundred establishments. -Owing to variation of styles and other special conditions, the women\\'s garment industry is highly seasonal. Repeated and numerous investigations, private and governmental, disclose that the workers in this industry have employment on the average of . only six months in the year. The period of employment is comprised within two working sieasons, the spring season which begins about the first day of February and lasts about ten or twelve weeks, and the fall season which begins about -the month of September and has a similar duration. Between seasons about thirty thousand women\\'s garment workers in the City of New York are totally idle, while the remainder work part time, some times on an average of one or two days a week. During the periods of idleness the workers mostly contract debts, and in order to exist at all, they must earn enough in the short busy periods not only to maintain themselves and their families during such periods, but also to make up for the shortage in the preceding period of idleness and to provide to some extent for the succeeding period of idleness. -The order of the Fuel Administrator works particular hardship on the workers in our industry and their families for the following reasons: -1. The nine remaining workless Mondays designated in the order of the Fuel Administrator come exactly within the period of the spring season, i. e., at a time when every day of work and wages counts most heavily for the workers. The nine enforced holidays will represent an absolute and total loss to the workers. They can not make up for the loss of such days on the theory that the spring season would be lengthened thereby, because no working period in the industry can be exteded beyond the ordinary term on account of the seasonal character of the -work. They can not expect to be paid for the idle Mondays because a majority of the employees arc piece workers and are paid only for work actually done, and with very few and insignificant exceptions, the employers in the industry have refused to pay even their week workers for such Mondays. -The preceding period of idleness in the industry has been exceptionally long and severe and the majority of the workers are in a condition of acute destitution. They can not physically stand a substantial curtailment of their earnings during the short season now beginning. -2. Another special reason why the order of the Fuel Administrator works particular hardship on the workers in the industry is that the great majority of them are Jews, many of whom observe Saturday as their day of Sabbath. These work ordinarily five days a week, and with the elimination of Mondays they will be reduced to only four work-days just at the time when they would have the opportunity to work. Such a condition threatens to cripple the industry, aside from inflicting untold hardship and privation upon the workers. -3. In an effort to overcome the handicap upon the industry it is quite likely that a large number of manufacturers will keep their establishments working overtime during the remaining five days of the week, including Saturdays. -The workers in the women\\'s garment industry have fought many years for a regulated and reasonable work-day in their industry, and have finally succeeded in establishing a work-week of forty-nine or fifty hours and the observation of Saturdays as holidays. If the manufacturers in our industry be permitted to go back to long work-days during the period covered by the order of the Fuel Administrator, the great danger is that the working standards in the industry, established with so much struggle and sacrifice, will be demoralized and destroyed forever. -As far as the object of fuel conservation is concerned, it would be totally defeated because in working additional hours at night, at least the same amount of coal would be consumed for heat and power and additional coal for light. -4. The fuel consumed in clothing factories is but a small item as compared with fuel used in other manufacturing plants. In the first instance large sections of the workers employed in such establishments, such as cutters, finishers, trimmers, button sewers, etc., work by hand, and the sewing machine consumes comparatively little power. The diflPerence between the coal required in such establishments for the prevention of injury to the plant from freezing and the amount of coal required for the operation of the plant is so small, and the saving so insignificant, that it does not justify the extraordinary hardship which the Monday closings inflict upon the workers in the industry. -The reason why the Union suggests the substitution of Saturdays as an alternative to the total exemption of the industry is because, as above indicated, many employees in the industry do not work on Saturdays, while those who do, work only half a day and consequently would lose only half their wages. -Mr. Benjamin Schlesinger, President International Ladies\\' Garment Workers\\' Union, Dear Mr. Schlesinger: -In the light of the facts presented to me, I am satisfied that injustice will be done the Ladies\\' Garment Workers if they are required to lay off on Mondays. -The State Fuel Administrators are, therefore, being instructed to allow coal to be furnished where necessary to heat and light the lofts and work shops occupied by the members of the Union of the Ladies\\' Garment Workers. -It will be remembered that Dr. Garfield\\'s order was strictly enforced because it was a war order. The wisdom of the order was much questioned by manufacturers and persons fully supporting the war policy of the Government. Naturally many people were thrilled with wonder at the exemption granted to the ladies\\' garment industry upon the request of our union. Some of our own manufacturers suddenly opened their eyes to the potent influence of our International Union. Heretofore they stubbornly refused to believe in the potency of our influence, even in the face of facts. -If this should seem mysterious to some of our employers, we should like to enlighten them on the point. Our wide influence is due to the business methods we pursue in dealing with the manufacturers. In the eight years during which our Union has become prominent in the labor movement and industrial centers our representatives have invariably employed reason and common sense in all undertakings of historical import for our Union. There was hardly a case in our industrial struggles and hostile attacks upon us in which we failed to emerge justified and vindicated. Public opinion, exclusive of the manufacturers and their backers, has in such cases always sympathized with and ranged itself on the side of our Union. -No wonder, therefore, that our President Schlesinger has succeeded in gaining access to the federal authorities and convincing Dr. Garfield of the urgency of an exemption for the workers of our industry. The order was revoked after the exemption had been in force one Monday. But this by no means detracts from the importance of the exceptional privilege granted to the industry through the offices of our Union. -In recent years there have been exceptional days in the life of our International Union deserving to be set apart as red-letter days in our history. But February 22, 1918, will be recorded in the annals of our union as a memorable day of particular significance. It was a day on which our membership thought not of its own persons^l interest, but of the urgent need of others; a day on which they felt with their whole heart and soul for the war sufferers; in which they expressed their pity and sympathy not only in work or thought, but in the exertion of brain and muscle in a practical way. They worked that day and donated their entire earnings to the needy victims of the war. -At this writing we* do not know as yet the result of their offerings. The heatless and lightless days affected this noble endeavor in no small degree, particularly so far as the manufacturers were concerned. In fact, through the heatless order the entire proposition had been in doubt, and it is possible that the sum total will not measure up to the original expectation. But after making all deductions the donation is bound to be a big one, probably the biggest contributed by any organization for this great purpose. -The purpose of this series of articles is to analyze our present form of organization and certain phases of the inner life of our locals. It is plain that certain vexing evils from which we suffer are caused directly by the enormous size of some of our local unions. However great our efforts to guard and protect the members\\' interest, many details must elude our vigilance and suffer neglect. -It is not our purpose to lay the blame for these evils at anyone\\'s door personally. The system has grown spontaneously. It was forced on us by circumstances beyond our control, after two great historic strikes and victories. -We had not expected such a tremendous upheaval, such a general response to our call for organization. When the strikes of the waistmakers in 1909-1910 and of the cloakmakers in 1910 were settled, and tens of thousands of these worker^ returned to the shops, transformed by the settlements into union shops, our officers and leaders of that time were in the position of one, suddenly entrusted with a colossal business concern, who feels like being in the woods, not knowing how to begin shaping its course. The first absorb-ing thought was to hold the mass of workers together in the organization. Every other consideration was thrown into the shade. -Even the most sagacious, intelligent and experienced men and women are limited in their power of foresight. Our leading spirits of that time may have had the presentiment that big locals would make for centralization, placing the control of the union in the hands of a very few. But there were so many problems pressing for solution that the leaders had no time to think how big locals were likely to work out in practice. All minds were then concentrated on consolidating the union, assure its existence and render it proof against the attacks of the employers and other enemies. -It was hoped that the centralization inherent in big locals might act as a protection. There was, at all events, no other solution of the difficulty. It could not then occur to anyone that locals of thousands of members would retard the spiritual development of the masses. No one could foresee that this form of organization would render it impossible to bear in mind the spiritual -Washington\\'s Birthday is a widely recognized holiday in all parts of the United States, and this year the streets of New York evinced the customary holiday aspect. But between six and seven P. M. large masses of people were seen streaming from the factory districts in the direction of the Eastside. They were the sympathetic ladies\\' garment workers. The writer of these lines observed many of them wending thir way homewards in the glittering snow. Young men and girls, week workers, who were entitled to pay though not working the day; who could have spent the day in some pleasant company, walked from work in their usual unassuming manner. Their inward souls, throbbing with pity and sympathy, shone out of their expressive eyes. They all seemed pleased in the consciousness that they had performed a great duty and noble deed on that day. -And very truly they have by this service to suffering and agonized humanity won a rare repute. Truly they are workers of whom our country might feel proud. By their devoted action they placed our International Ladies\\' Garment Workers\\' Union on a high pedestal of fame and prestige. -needs of every member, and that after seven years the mass of the membership would remain stationary — indifferent to the union ; union men and women by compulsion. -There is a saying, \"You cannot see the wood for the trees.\" This is very true of our locals. Their membership is so large that the idea of the human beings, which the membership represents, is lost. The members are dealt with as a mass and not as individual persons, without whose action and cooperation there can be no organization and no democracy. The result is that instead of such locals being organizations of workers whose hearts and souls are permeated with the spirit and ideals of the union — unity, solidarity, brotherhood — most of our people have formed the notion that the business agent is the union, that the manager is the union, that the executive board is the union, that the joint board is the union, that the union office is the union; in short, that the union is not themselves, but something apart. For a labor union such a state of affairs is unnatural. -Thus it is easy to understand why we are only just opening our eyes to the lack of an essential, which is more important than the machinery of the office — an essential that would save the offices of the locals nine-tenths of the effort and energy and money. We have the outward form of organization, but we lack the spirit, that spirit now reflected in a comparatively few active members, but which should be reflected in all the members. -All students of the psychology and character of our people have observed that we have a large measure of enthusiasm which animates us on certain occasions. In strenuous agitations before and during strikes, and whenever we feel that we have been or are being dealt with unjustly we are capable of manifesting greater enthusiasm than the workers of other races and nationalities. This enthusiasm should have permeated our members with the spirit -of unwavering unity and a desire to be active in the interest of the organization. But no such effect has been produced. -The ideal of labor — emancipation from wage slavery — ^that is visibly coming to fruition even in our time, has not achieved its present stage of progress without immense sacrifice. The labor movement, like the ancient religions, has had its heroes and martyrs. It is, therefore, capable of inspiring courage and prompting to noble effort. -Trade unionism will be in a fair way of achieving its aim when every member of a local union will feel the urge to enlist in its service, whether as a shop chairman, a business agent, a local officer, a committee man, an organizer, etc. The number of such people in our union is limited because our big locals present no opportunity for getting hold of every member individually, to bring out his or her talent, and help them to attain self-expression. -Every one of our big locals may be likened to a house, beautiful and attractive without but formal and chilling within. It has costly furniture and decorations, but this is offset by an official, forbidding atmosphere. In vain the host tries to infuse life and enthusiasm into his guests; his dry, formal words fall on irresponsive, deaf ears. After this experience how can the guests be expected to act otherwise than shun this cold, formal house with all its unreal officiality. -Only now, after some eight years of active life, we have discovered that our people lack the knowledge of trade union principles, and we want to rectify the shortcoming by unity centers and educational institutions. We should not, however, delude ourselves into believing that lectures and courses, though good and useful, will beget the new spirit and interest which we want to see manifested, if we shall retain our present form of organization and let the big locals remain as they are. There lurks a danger, which may not be seen by all. Those, however, who have been long familiar with the labor -movement know it from sad experience. It is that the more intelligent members who taste from the tree of general knowledge and education discard the trade and the union and seek better opportunities in life. But this is not our aim. Our aim is to increase the number of thoroughgoing union men and competent and reliable union leaders who, fired with the zeal for our ideals, should serve the cause of our movement. It is not our aim to educate men and women who should abandon our cause and go into the service of private interests. -Leaders Must Rise from the Ranks Let us, by all means, educate and enlighten our members. At the same time we must bring them up as true, devoted union men and women. But the latter is a process which we cannot carry out in our present big locals. To attempt this with any measure of success we must reorganize our union into smaller locals where every member can be easily reached and where he or she can find an opportunity for self-expression. For self-expression, however imperfect, develops the mind. In our present locals the mass of the members individually can find no expression and therefore the great majority is indifferent. -In no country and in no industry have trade organizations assumed such an unnatural form of organization as the locals of our International Union. Take the trade unions of Great Britain (and Great Britain is generally recognized as the cradle of trade unionism and labor organization). In certain large industries in England there are powerful labor unions and federations which have reached the highest degree of development. They are steadfast in principles. Their stability and permanence was assured half a century ago in spite of legal and social disabilities. For the last twenty-five years or so they have been organized politically as well as economically, and they are represented in the British Parliament through the powerful and influential Labor Party. They possess enormous funds and they are rich in qualities that riches cannot buy — unity, harmony, so-hdarity and capable leadership. For several decades they have had the most experienced leaders that could be desired; yet these leaders did not come from other classes in society. They did not attend universities, where, as Ingersol says, \"pebbles are polished and diamonds are dimmed.\" They do not hail from the professions, being neither doctors nor lawyers. They have risen from the ranks. They -Such men as the late James Keir Hardie, John Bums, Arthur Henderson and many others rise before the mental vision The British labor leaders have furnished cabinet ministers for the British Government. A persistent opinion has been current within the last few months that in the coming reconstruction after the war or even sooner, the mantle of the British premiership will fall upon Arthur Henderson; and Arthur Henderson received his training and experience in the ranks of the horny-handed toilers. -Many of the British trade unions at various times have been in the throes of great industnal upheavals. But deteat and failure have not broken their spirit of unity in spite of the system of strike-breaking recognized and well organized there under the respectable name of \"Free Labor Association \\' The workers of the prihcipal national industries, except perhaps the tailors are organized in extensive national unions and industrially federated. But those big national unions are composed of small groups. Seven members constitute the smallest organized group or local, and there is no necessity for a provision m the constitution prohibitmg locals or branches of more than several hundred members. -RrU-Y/^^\"^^ ^\"^ ^\"\"^^\\'^ ^ith in the lintish trade unions; they are real living facts. Democracy there means that every individual member is assured of his full rights of expressing his opinions and personal wishes, and it IS instinctively understood that when a local consists of more than several -hundred members individual rights of expression cannot be assured. Only among the Jewish tailors and industries employing immigrants is there a tendency to be grouped in centralized independent unions, and for that reason these union hardly ever acquire stability. The least crisis upsets their equilibrium. As the organized Jewish workers are drawn principally from Eastern Europe, their conception of democracy is not so pronounced as that of the natives. -One cannot expect the speedy realization of democratic perfection in our locals; but small locals would be a good beginning. Small locals would call forth personal interest, while many intelligent members hold aloof from our present big locals. In our huge organizations big men and big sensations are called for, and these members -do not consider themselves big enough. But in smaller locals there is room for the ordinarily intelligent element to develop and become genuine leaders, while now this element is consumed with regret at having no chance of selfexpression. -Some people object that the splitting up of a local of 10,000 members into twenty or so locals would cause serious difficulties. \"Where would these locals meet? Will it not be an expensive proposition ? Will it not be almost impossible to watch over so many small organizations?\" -To this we answer: All these are petty details that can be met. First of all it is necessary that our people shall be convinced of the urgent necessity of this reform and be fired with enthusiasm for the idea. The rest will take its natural course. But we shall return to the subject in the next issue. -I have no doubt that at the next convention of our International Union which will be held in Boston beginning May 20, 1918, the usual large number of resolutions will be submitted, calling for the organization of all the ladies\\' garment workers in every part of the country. -From past conventions we know that no resolution of this kind is ever disapproved by the convention. On the contrary, all such motions are carried unanimously. -The delegates to our conventions* know that it is the function of the International Union to organize the workers. They know the importance of this task and therefore adopt these resolutions with enthusiasm. -Our delegates, however, do not clearly perceive the difficulties we encounter in the effort of carrying out our organizing campaigns. They do not know the amount of money required to assure the success of the work. They are not familiar with the element confronting us. They cannot know all this. They only know one -thing — that it is our duty to organize the workers. Therefore any resolution pertaining to organization is carried with enthusiasm, and the General Executive Board, including the President and Secretary, receive a mandate from the convention to give effect to all the adopted resolutions. What happens next? -The newly elected officers, knowing the great importance of their mission and the responsibility these resolutions impose on them, are determined to comply implicitly with the wishes of the convention and immediately set to work, some times even without due preparation, for the great and difficult task. -Our industries have two short seasons, which begin at the same time throughout the country, and organizing work can be done with a certain degree of success only during the season. The workers are then in the shops working long hours, at top speed, and receiving miserable pay for their arduous toil. Then, when organizers come and enlighten them as -to the urgency of uniting together, their ears are open to the message that unity means their salvation. -During the slack season tHe workers feel discouraged and depressed, laden with care as to where to borrow money to maintain their wives and children and tide them over the hard weeks or months. At such times they have not the minds to listen to the call of the union representative. The luckier workers, who chance to remain at work in the slack season, are afraid to risk their small earnings, and dodge the organizer. They do not want to incur the displeasure of the employer, who, not being subject to any control, might discharge them. This would mean for them weeks and perhaps months of starvation. Therefore it is plainly impossible to start organizing campaigns in the slack season. -As already said, the seasons in our industries begin in all the cities at the same time; and as they are mostly short seasons they afford little time for conducting successful\\' organizing campaigns. But in view of the great mandate entrusted to the elected officers by the convention, the officers, in their desire to carry it into effect, often elaborate organizing plans of far-reaching scope beyond our financial strength and organizing ability. Under such circumstances not all the campaigns can be crowned with success. -In illustration of the foregoing remarks I shall cite, for the benefit of the delegates to the next convention who will have before them the question of organizing campaigns, a fact which will prove the correctness of my statement. -At our last convention in Philadelphia hundreds of resolutions were adopted, most of which had reference to the question of organization. -When the newly elected officers assembled at the first meeting after the convention and took up the long list of resolutions calling for organizing campaigns, it became clear that if the International officers were to attempt ernbarking on such a comprehensive mission as assigned them by the delegates they would have to extend their organizing activities to all branches of -President Schlesinger therefore submitted a plan of undertaking eleven organizing campaigns in different cities. I have great respect for our general president, and while I have not underestimated his inexhaustible energies and devotion to the work, it was clear to me that to carry out this excellent plan we stood in need of larger financial means and an additional staff of organizers. I thought that to carry out the task successfully required almost superhuman powers. Everywhere the attention of the general officers was in demand and everywhere funds were needed. As soon as we plunged into these campaigns we found that we had undertaken much more than we could accomplish with the men and means at our disposal. The pressure of the demand for organization brought to bear on us at the convention was so great that in seeking help from many of our locals we, in our enthusiasm, over-estimated our strength, and for that reason the results were not such as we had desired. -First, because it is the function of our International Union to spread the idea of unity by which the workers may protect their earnings and interests. -Second, to maintain the improvements won in the organized cities and trades it behooves us to swing into line the unorganized \\'workers, so as to prevent their unchecked competition from being a menace to the higher standards of the organized workers. Therefore the delegates are justified in pressing for energetic organizing campaigns. But they must bear in mind first that the elected officers entrusted with this work will do their duty. Adopting resolutions is not the main thing. If they wish the officers to fulfill their function of tackling the organizing problem with success something more than voting for resolutions is required. This brings us to the most important question of raising the per capita tax, which we shall discuss in the next article. -Some people in discussing an intricate problem of conflicting feelings and interests, themselves darken counsel and then complain that they cannot see. -One might say the same concerning the six-pointed controversy between the Central Federated Union of New York and the United Hebrew Trades; the United Garment Workers and the Amalgamated Clodiing Workers, and the false statements current in some circles that the American Federation of Labor is antagonistic to the trade imions of Jewish workers. They who are gifted widi a special inclination to see creeping black shadows everywhere, imagine this question as a sort of bullfight, and are alarmed at the dark visions conjured up by dieir own minds. -Now, there happens along an impartial labor man of old standing, like myself, with no personal axe to grind; one who is not directly connected with the Federation of Labor, the Hebrew Trades or any of the aforesaid contending parties, yet one who is regarding the entire controversy cooly and dispassionately from the standpoint of trade union principle and organization — and what I see is a thick fog created by those of the United Hebrew Trades themselves; and in a fog the imagination is bound to be very active and mistake shadow for reality. -The fact is that our friends of the Hebrew Trades until recently have not had a clear conception of the resolution adopted at the Buffalo convention of the American Federation of Labor. Furthermore, they do not seem to understand the question in its true bearing on trade union organization. Was it because of fear for the existence of the Hebrew Trades, or because our friends of the Amalgamated have been adding fuel to the fire, while there arose in the interval the question of the Capmakers and Millinery workers? The fact is — ^they had confused and hazy notions on the subject, and they should be grateful to President Schlesinger of our International Union, who cleared the foggy atmosphere -and saved the United Hebrew Trades from a perilous situation of tragi-comedy. Had the United Hebrew Trades agreed to die terms of the Central Federated Union, involving the admission to its counsels of delegates from the United Garment Workers, diey would have placed their existence in jeopardy. -Unfortunately the Yiddish press has not presented the facts of the case clearly from the true viewpoint of organization and trade union discipline. Both sides have distorted the issue. Those of the Central Federated Union have brought into the controversy such outside and irrelevant matters as die People\\'s Council and Workmen\\'s Council and tried at the Buffalo convention to raise a bugbear of some imaginary persons intending to form a Federation of Labor in oppositign to the existing body. Meddlesome and misinformed writers in die Yiddish press, on the other hand, have much exaggerated the so-called Jewish question and by insinuation and suggestion indirecdy alarmed a certain class of readers that the Central Federated Union and the American labor movement were hostile to the Jewish workers as such. In the meantime our friends of die Amalgamated Clothing Workers and their sympadiizers have kept pouring oil on the flames and, letting loose their imagination, indulged in some such false conclusion as this: \"Well, it doesn\\'t matter, anyhow. When the worst comes to the worst, the Jewish Labor movement might stand on its own feet; it has no need of the solidarity and moral support of the American Federation of Labor.\" -But this is sheer nonsense. Only irresponsible writers and platform orators, whose pen or tongue runs away with their common sense, are capable of such suppositions. The \"Jewish Labor Movement\" is not a TtLce movement, nor yet a Jewish aadoDal movement. It might be that, if the fates permit, in the Holy Land, but it cannot be and must not be that in America. In America, it is no more than a Jewish -language movement. Here Jewish workers most all unite and fraternize and be in hearty solidarity with the America^ organized workers. First, because their organized ranks are not formed exclusively of Jewish workers, but partly also of Italian, American, Russian, Polish, French, German and other workers. The International Ladies\\' Garment Workers\\' Union admits to membership even negroes; and in many shops workers of all these various nationalities often work side by side. If the Jewish Workers should lose their senses and turn the question into a race question, and imagine that they could afford to be at loggerheads with the American workers, then, they might expect, in some localities, to incur hatred and persecution similar to that which many of them endured in their countries of origin. -In the spring of 1917 terrible riots-— fire and death against the negroes— broke out in Bast St. Louis. What was the main cause of that savage and inhuman outbreak? It was the blending of the race question with the labor question, and it proved that undet cetrain circumstances human beings turn into wild beasts. To trifle with feelings is to play with fire. -Now, what is there in die question under discussion (and in every human question) other than a question of feeling? It is ridiculous to think that the fight of the Central Federated Union against the United Hebrew Trades is a race question, or a fight against Jewish workers. The fight is against the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. It began soon after the Amalgamated had been organized and there will be no peace until the dispute between the United Garment Workers and Amalgamated Clothing Workers is satisfactorily settled. How can it be a fight directed against the Jewish workers, in view of the fact that there are Jewish workers in die ranks of the United Garment Workers? Then there are numerous Jewish members of the American Federation of Labor in various cities all over the country. -Let us therefore concentrate attention on the gist of the question and examine the resolution adopted at the Bu£Falo convention of the American Federation of Labor and the recent action of the United Hebrew Trades from this angle. Let us first of all understand the facts of the case and -Whereas, a serious condition exists III the clotbing industry in Greater New York caused by what is known as the Amalgamated Clothing Workers, who seceded from the United Garment Workers o£ America with the intent of destroying that recognized organization; and -Whereas, The United Hebrew Trades, a body consisting of various local unions of different trades, and which is not chartered by the American Federation of Labor, renders all possible support to the seced\\' ers and is, therefore, antagonistic. -(In the last \"whereas\" Delegate Brindell, its mover, brought in a bogejrman in the shape of the People\\'s Council and Workmen\\'s Council and tried to alarm the delegates into believing that the purpose of the above-said organizations was to supplant the American Federation of Labor — an allegation which was false and misleading. — ^A. R.) -Resolved, That the thirty-seventh Annual Convention of the American Federation of Labor direct all international unions whose local unions are represented in the United Hebrew Trades, to order all such local unions to wididraw from that body, and in case such local unions refuse to withdraw, to reorganise them under the banner of the American labor movement. (The last underscored phrase is rather hazy, for are they not already enrolled in die American labor movement? — ^Bd.) -Note that in this resolution there is not even a hint about the United Hebrew Trades being required to admit into its counsels delegates from the United Garment Workers. True, Mr. Brindell of die C. F. U. wished to add some such clause as this to the resolution. Delegate Benj. Schlesinger, however, strenuously opposed it and the committee dropped it. Furthermore, Brindell subsequently wished to withdraw the entire resolution, because the delegates favoring the Hebrew Trades had made it quite clear that the entire basis on which it rested was unfounded. The convention practically accepted the statement diat the United Hebrew Trades was not antagonistic, but on the contrary, loyal to the American Federation of Labor. According to the convention report (page 381) the convention accepted the view \"that it might bring a great hardship and injury -Thus, the basic part of the resolution being unfounded, its entire superstructure — the decision \"to direct all international unions,\" etcv— falls to the the ground. If die purpose of the resolution was, as James Holland of the New York State Federation of Labor expressed it, that \"something should be done by the convention to bring peace and harmony in New York City,*\\' then, instead of the decision bringing peace and harmony, it is rather calculated to bring bitter war. No, brothers of the American Federation of Labor; this is not the way to bring peace and harmony. There is a much better way, namely to bring together the contending parties; and the only man who is fit and able to accomplish this feat is President Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor. -Looking at the matter, as we are doing here, with cold reason, without passion, prejudice or partiality, but from a purely trade union standpoint, one cannot conceive that the Executive Council of the American Federation of Labor should commit such an error of judgment as to force the international unions, in their turn to force their local unions, to withdraw from the Hebrew Trades, after the charges against this body were admitted to be unfounded — a slur on its reputation. -Of course it is possible that the Executive Council of the Federation might take that mistaken stand; but the international unions are within their right not to comply with it. It seems to me that the Federation by its constitution cannot interfere in the internal affairs of the international unions or deprive them of dieir rightful local autonomy. The Federation can neither compel diem to a£Bliate their membership with any central body nor compel them to keep out of a special language body which has definitely declared its loyalty to the Federation. All diat the Executive Council can do is to try moral persuasion—call upon the international unions to act in a certain way, but the international unions have a right to disagree with the advice. -Council will not be logical, consistent or practical, to recommend the expulsion of the non-complying unions. The effect of diis, if enforced, would be to fan the fires of the brotherly dispute rather than to subdue and extinguish them. -Possibly the next convendon of die American Federation of Labor will decide to compel the international unions to act in the sense of that or a similar resolution. But before the convention will decide upon such a course the international unions concerned will have an opportunity to defend their position and convince the delegates that theirs is the correct attitude, while the possible attitude of the Federation is not in accord with the spirit of trade nnionism. It is difficult to conceive that the coming convention will persistentiy refuse to listen to reason and act upon a mistaken conception of discipline. It is easy to imagine diat the delegates of the United Garment Workers and of the Central Federated Union will urge such action; but it is inconceivable that a great convention of a mighty national movement will be so narrow-minded as to decide upon a solution of diis question by such methods. It is impossible to believe that the Executive Council of the Federation will back such methods, and that President Gompers, who has a thorough and intimate knowledge of the entire situation, will depart from his life-long belief in complete local autonomy and swing the weight of his great influence in the scale of the intolerant party in this business. -If well-reasoned protests and logical contentions should fail after all and the elements bent on war to the knife should happen to carry the day, then, of course, the international unions will have to submit to the rule of the majority; they will have no other alternative. They must not allow themselves to be expelled from the American labor movement. But in that case, the pugnacious elements must not imagine that they will thereby succeed in supressing the natural instinct of die Jewish organized workers to group themselves into some Yiddish-speaking central body for the purpose of helping to organize the unorganized Jewish workers. President Gompers knows that when you drive out such an instinct through the door, it will come back through the window. -Now what should be the constructive attitude of the international unions concerned at the coming convention of the American Federation of Labor? Namely this: \"We are decidedly opposed to dual unionism; but in this question between the United Garment Workers and the Amalgamated Clothing Workers diere has arisen an unusual situation . In politics and government an unsuccessful revolt is condemned and punished, but a successful revolt is called a revolution and is eventually recognized. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers practically accomplished a revolution. Its purpose had been not to destroy the United Garment Workers, as alleged in Brindell\\'s resolution, but to organize the disorganized tailors whom the United Garment Workers for years neglected to organize, or employed clumsy methods of organization. The Amalegamated Union has organized them in their tens of thousands. This is noticeable wherever there is a flourishing tailoring industry. -\"It is therefore the duty of the American labor movementto give recognition to these organized workers, to reach out to them a brotherly hand and take them into the fold of the great family of American trade unions. They have deserved this in view of their great achievement. They have, properly speaking, accomplished diat which the Federation wishes the workers of every trade to bring about — ^they have organized and won union shops and union conditions of labor.\" -The next convention of the American Federation of Labor ought to decide that these two rival bodies — ^the United Garment Workers and Amalgamated Clothing Workers — should join forces. That would be a peace with honor for the Federation and a great gain for the labor movement. And the Amalgamated Clothing Workers must loyally submit to such a true trade union proposition, because this is the only way out of a tangled situation in which it finds itself outlawed and separated from the labor movement. -In this connection it should be conceded that the attitude of the Amalgamated union to the Federation was illogical and improper. It seemed as if the Amalgamated sought to carry on a fight against Samuel Gompers and the Federation of Labor. How ridiculous? Has the Amalgamated -expected Samuel Gompers to withdraw his support from the United Garment Workers — an affiliated body with the Federation — and give it to the Amalgamated, which is, after all, a dual union? Has the Amalgamated Union expected to win the public opinion of the American labor movement by discharging literary pop-guns at Samuel Gompers and the Federation of Labor? How much better it would have been to maintain a conciliatory attitude and defend its action by proper evidence? -But let bygones be bygones. In the next three months die Amalgamated can help to free itself from its condition of separate existence and help the international unions arrayed on its side to advance its cause at the coming convention of the American Federation of Labor. The labor movement is too sacred a cause to permit such methods. -I have tried to discuss this controversy in an earnest, impartial and honest manner. Had the United Hebrew Trades adopted die proposition of die Central Federated Union and admitted the locals of the United Garment Workers, the struggle in die clothing trade would have been aggravated. The sword would have fallen on the stone. By its refusal to comply with a demand that was not part of the resolution of the Buffalo convention a way has now been opened for the ventilation of die whole question in a new light, and possible settiement. -Had not our President Schlesinger clarified the situation from this standpoint at the meeting of the United Hebrew Trades, that body, out of fear, might have committed an unpardonable error., It is sometimes necessary to save a person from himself. For \"Nothing is so bad, but what thinking makes it so.\" -The most important news item of the past month was the report of the Mediation Commission appointed some time ago by President Wilson to probe into the great labor unrest in the country, particularly into the causes of the extensive strikes in the industries of the West. The report rests the entire blame on the employers and profiteers. -The commission consists of William B. Wilson, Secretary of Labor, chairman; John H. Walker, president of the Illinois State Federation of Labor; £. P. Marsh, president of the Washington State Federation of Labor, and U. Z. Reed and J. L. Spangler representing the employers. -Important as this news item was to ttie average reaHer of die daily press, it is an old story to the organized workers. The omissions and commissions of the captains of industry and their inhuman treatment of their employees have been for years common knowledge to the advanced and well-informed section of the American public. The situation was far worse twenty-five or thirty years ago when the workers generally were poorly organized. Cruelties and inhuman deeds then perpetrated on laboring men and women were deemed natural occurrences in the public mind, and neither the public nor the government interfered or sympathized with the wronged and oppressed. -Even some three years ago when the well-known Commission on Industrial Relations conducted its far-reaching investigation into the causes of the great unrest, and the government published its scathing report in several volumes, the revelations and recommendations of the commission left the government and Congress unmoved. No attempt was made to ameliorate conditions. Those recommendations were, in a certain sense, similar to the proposals of the present report, but they fell on deaf ears. The industrial policy of the country was then still fashioned after the old individualism, which tacitly looked on -while profiteers were exploiting and grinding down the faces of the poor, the weak and helpless. The government then held fast to the principle of \\'let it alone\" and did not interfere in the industrial wars between capital and labor. States sometimes did interfere — on the side of capital. The federal government could only investigate, and it was up to Congress to take legislative action. But since Congress hardly represented or sympathized with labor, attempts to remedy the situation by enacting laws were frustrated by the representatives and agents of the employers\\' interests. Where any attempt at legislation succeeded, the law enacted was in most cases killed by the Supreme Court on the pretext of its being contrary to the spirit of the constitution. -Within the last few years under the pressure of the war the aforesaid individualistic principle of \"let it alone\" has been d3dng by inches in Europe. In America, too, it is now in its death agony. Only the Supreme Court is still sustaining it by antilabor decisions, looking backward and thinking the thoughts of a past age. -But the public and an ever-growing section of the press are fast readjusting their views in accord with the new circumstances and changed feelings. -It has dawned on the foremost rulers of democratic countries that without the goodwill of labor the nation\\'s interests cannot be advanced. And reasonable industrial leaders and advanced thinkers have opened their eyes to another fact, namely that, while the workers ask as a reward for their labor just sufficient to tide them over the ever rising cost of living, the profiteers have set their energies on amassing treasures out of the rivers of blood and tears flowing, as never before, in both hemispheres. -For this reason the report of the President\\'s Mediation Commission has called forth so much attention; not because it has brought to light something new in the industrial life of the country, but because the report has touched a responsive chord in the thoughts and sentiments of the times. -\"The elimination to the utmost practical extent of all profiteering during the period of the war. ... -\"Some form of collective relationship between management and men is indispensable. The recognition of this principle by the government should form an accepted part of the labor policy of the nation. . . . -\"Instead of waiting for adjustment after grievances come to the surface, there is needed the establishment of continuous administrative machinery for the disposition of industrial issues and the avoidance of an atmosphere of contention and the waste of disturbances. -\"The eight-hour day is an established policy of the country; experience has proved the justification of the principle also in war time. Provision must of course be made for longer hours in case of emergencies. Labor will readily meet this requirement if its misuse is guarded against by appropriate overtime payments.\" -The commission also recommends the establishment of a \"unified direction of the labor administration of the United States for the period of the war. ... A singleheaded administration with full power to determine and establish the necessary administrative structure.\" Then \"when assured of sound labor conditions and effective means for the just redress of grievances, labor should surrender all practices which tend to restrict maximum efficiency. . . . Labor will eagerly devote its all, if only it be treated with confidence and understanding, subject neither to indulgence nor neglect, but dealt with as a part of the citizenship of the state.\" -All this to us is nothing new. Trade unions have been working for and urging such methods since many years. It is only new and startling to those whose eyes have been closed to ugly facts in industry. -Chas. M. Schwab of the steel trust is ready for the social revolution. So it appears from his speech at the dinner of the Old Boys on January 24; and he is also ready, ^^rilly-niUy, to surrender his millions and become a manual laborer. He does not like the prospect, of course, but he is prepared for the inevitable. -Mr. Schwab is the president of the Bethlehem Steel Qompany of Pittsburgh, which employs some 20,000 workers. These laborers have never had an easy time, as the system of work is twelve hours a day for seven days a week and the wages of most of them do not exceed $2.50 a day. He gives the impression of a man caught in the act, m^o hazards the excuse: \"If it is yours, then take it.\" -Schwab\\'s prediction that the time is coming when the workers will dominate the world surprised the Socialists and spread consternation among the more thoughtful capitalists and those m^o uphold the present system. One may imagine how they felt when they read words that heretofore had been uttered only by Socialists. They must have thought: \"If the lions tremble what should the wolves do?\" -No wonder, then, that their spokesmen in the press had a sort of reproach for Schwab for revealing his fear of the future and being the first millionaire to dig the grave of the capitalist system. He said among other things: -\"We are facing another social situation, which we should be keenly alive to, a situation which is going to come at the close of the war, a \\'social renaissance\\' of the whole world. Call it socialism, social revolution, Bolshevism, or what you will, it is a leveling process, and means that the workman without property, who labors with his hands, is going to be the man who will dominate the world. It is going to be a great hardship to the owners of property, but like all revolutionary movements it will probably work good. The sooner we realize this the better it will be for America. We must not fight this movement, but we must educate it We must go among the people of the working classes and mingle with them, and learn their feelings and thoughts.\" -Speaking of the effects of the social revolution, Mr. Schwab said: \"No doubt at first the changes will be carried to extremes and the pendulum of change will swing too far and great hardships will ensue, but in a very short time the pendulum will right itself and the world will go jogging on the same way as before, with the United States as leader as long as her virility, which makes her the greatest country in the world, lasts. -\"The great effect of socialism would be the destruction of all aristocracies except the one of merit. The aristocracy of birth will cease to exist and the aristocracy of wealth will be no more. The coming aristocracy is to be composed of men who have done something for their country and the world at large, men who have worked for the good of mankind. Don\\'t ^ink I am anxious to give away my wealth and work with my hands. Indeed, ^ere are few of us who like to do what is good for them. But we will find that we must eat the pill, sweet or bitter.** -This talk moved Congressman Meyer London to comment: \"When the princes of finance and the lords of industry prophesy the victory of the workers and of Socialism, I become suspicious. I look around to see whether there is an3rthing l3ring loose that these fellows haven\\'t grabbed yet.\" -have received such increases are being impoverished. Even regular work and a 20 per cent raise do not bring them up to their former level. -Some manufacturers wax indignant when their employees ask for an increase of wages. Here is an extract from tfie first report of a committee of economists appointed by the government to study the purchasing power of money in war time, which shows that wage increases of 5, 10 and even 20 per cent arc insignificant when compared with increased living costs. -\"The living cost and the level of commodity prices in general are now, as we are all aware, extremely high. The average wholesale prices in ^e United States last month were 81 per cent above that of July, 1914; that is, the purchasing power of money over goods in the wholesale markets has been almost cut in half. -\"The rise in retail prices of foods in the same period has been 57 per cent This means a reduction to less than twothirds in the purchasing power of money over foods in the retail markets. Abroad the rise of prices has been even greater. -\"Between 1896 and 1914 wholesale prices in the United States were rising at the average rate of only one-fifth of 1 per cent per month; but even that small rate, long continued, was enough to make the high cost of living a very painful fact** -Washington— Witii a threatened frontal attack by their employes, and their flank endangered by Uncle Sam as a result of their attempts to block investigations by Congress, the nation\\'s meat barons have adjusted differences with their employes. They agreed to cease union discrimination and refer wage demands to arbitration, the decision to be effective as of January 14. Secretary of Labor Wilson will name the arbitrator. -The settlement includes recognition of committees and seniority in promotions. The question of equal pay for women who arc doing men\\'s work is referred to the arbitrator. -Last fall, on returning from the West, the President\\'s mediation commission effected an adjustment of this dispute, or thought it did until the packers kicked over the traces by insisting that arbitration should be of the long-distance variety, through correspondence, with no cross-examinations. The workers refused to accept this letter-writing plan, and asked President Wilson to take over the plants during the war. The unionists pledged the President a fuU-handed equipment for every packing plant in the country. The President promised to consider this request and referred the wage demands to his mediation commission, which cited the packers to come to this city and present their side. -During the last several months a wave of organization has swept through the packing industry and the meat barons have been forced to set aside old antagonisms. In Chicago, where 40,000 workers are employed, two-thirds of them are. members of trade unions. -San Francisco— Organized workers, farmers and co-operators have formed the California union of producers and consumers. -The new organization, expected by its founders to become an economic and political force, consists of the Califomia State Federation of Labor, the Farmers\\' Educa-tional and Co-operative Union and ^e Pacific Co-operative League. Joint action by the three parties is necessary on any question and each organization will remain in fun life for its separate purpose, and the united support of the three will be given to the activities of each» in so far as mutual interest and united opinion warrant. -\"To bring joint action to bear on pressing legislative changes; to further public ownership of all public utilities, including transportation and communication; to free the land and society from privilege and monopoly, and to provide a practical plan of co-operation for the equitable distribution of food and other necessities of life.\" -Indianapolis — ^Members of the United Mine Workers must raise $800,000 for bonds to appeal a $600,000 verdict against them, in an Arkansas federal court. The Coronado Coal company of that state was awarded $200,000 damages for alleged violation of the anti-trust law. Under this act the company is entitled to three times the amount of the award. -The miners are confronted with two grave legal entanglements — ^the Coronado and the Hitchman cases. -The first case is based on a violation of the anti-trust law and the Hitchman case rests on the theory that where an employer secures an agreement from his employes that they will not join a union while employed by him, union officials can be enjoined if they attempt to interest the employes in trade unionism. In connection with the Hitchman case the United States supreme court has cited officers of the United Mine Workers to appear before it on March 4 to show cause why they should not be punished for contempt -\"Notice of a temporary injunction was served on General President Sidney Hillman and Secretary Joseph Schlossberg last week in an action begim by Larry Levy, pants manufacturer, of 154 Bleecker street, in an effort to break a strike that has been -conducted against this firm for six weeks. Arguments were made before Supreme Court Justice Bijur Thursday by attorneys for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers for the dissolution of the temporary injunction. -\"Levy charges in his application for the injunction that his business is being injured by the strike, and that picketing is keeping workers from his shops in Manhattan and Brooklyn. -\"The strike was caused by the refusal of the firm to grant equal distribution of work and because of discrimination against members of the New York Clothing Cutters\\' Union.\" -The question of Woman Suffrage is beginning to agitate Germany, despite the government\\'s forcible insistence that this and kindred questions must not be made the subject of agitation until after the war. -Three formidable national organizations are now openly campaigning in Germany in behalf of Woman\\'s Suffrage — the Woman\\'s Department of the Social Democratic Party, the German Imperial Union for Woman\\'s Suffrage and the German Women\\'s Suffrage Society. These organizations have just issued a united manifesto in which they say: -\"Up to the present Germany stands iii the lowest rank of nations as regards women\\'s rights. In most civilized lands women have already been given a large share in public affairs. German women have been granted nothing except within the most significant limits. -\"In New Zealand and most American States, and even before the war in Finland and Norway, they had been given political rights: today England, Sweden, Russia and many other countries give them a full or limited franchise. The war has brought a full victory to the women of England, Canada, Russia and Denmark, and large concessions are within sight in France, Holland and Hungary. -\"Among us Germans, not only the national but even the communal franchise is denied, or even a share in the industrial and commercial courts. In the demand for the democratization of German public life our legislators do not seem to even admit the existence of women.\" -The quarterly meeting of the General Executive Board was held at Hotel Waldorf, Toledo, Ohio, beginning Friday, February 8, and continuing until Wednesday, February 13, 1918. All the vice presidents of the International were present, as well as Secretary Ab. BaroflF and President Schlesinger, who presided. -Of late these quarterly meetings have assumed a particular importance. No routine official matters engage the attention of the Board but fundamental questions relating to the life and growth of our local unions. Much time is devoted to an earnest discussion of reports concerning organization work and plans for the future. -A very interesting report was heard regarding the agitation for introducing week work in our industries. It was encouraging to learn that the workers in large numbers are being converted to the idea of week work. Other reports related to various achievements of our International Union in the last three months, which were a source of satisfaction and encouragement to the assembled vice presidents. -Almost in all industries where we have agreements with the employers the International Union succeeded by negotiation in securing increases of wages for our members. Even in industries where the agreements do not expire until 1919 the manufacturers were prevailed upon to grant an increase of wages. -The nation-wide influence and prestige of our International Union has been shown recently in the fact that Dr. Garfield, the Federal Fuel Administrator, granted special exemption for the ladies\\' garment factories, permitting the use of heat and light on the heatless and lightless Mondays, so as to keep the members of our union in employment. Dr. Garfield granted the exemption upon request of President Schlesinger, who was accompanied by President Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor, after having been informed of the condition of our members and urgency for the exemption. The fact that the heatless order has now been revoked, makes no difference in the fact of our industry having been thus privileged. -and show cause why its charter should not be revoked for deliberately failing to comply with the decision of the General Executive Board, in session at Montreal, in October, 1917. That decision read, in part: -1. All grievances of workers arising in shops controlled by Local No. 17 shall hereafter be taken up for adjustment directly by the Joint Board instead of the office of Local No. 17. -2. The Joint Board shall attend to all grievances of workers of such shops from one office and shall take care that such office be managed and conducted by a manager and business agents fully familiar with the various grades of work made in Local No. 17 shops as well as with the system of work prevailing in such shops. -According to paragraph 4 of that decision \"all controversies with respect to the meaning or practical application of the above decision shall be submitted to and passed upon by the General President of the International subject only to an appeal to the convention.\" President Schlesinger interpreted the decision in the sense that Local No. 17 must abandon its separate office for complaints and move into the Joint Board. -The Local No. 17 committee, consisting of Brothers J. Heller, S. Goldin, D. Nisnevitz, A. Jacobin sky and Stankevitch, asked the General Executive Board to deal leniently with their local. They sought to impress the Board that the decision was unjust to the local, which had committed no offence and therefore had not expected to be thus penalized. They explained that at a well-attended meeting their members had protested against the decision of the General Executive Board. -President Schlesinger pointed out to the committee that the Executive Board of Local No. 17 had not acted loyally toward the International. Being a part of the organization they must respect the decision of its high officers, particularly when, as in this case, the decision was so mild. -After due discussion, and bearing in mind that the Executive Board of Local No. 17, instead of compljring with the decision, had called a members\\' meeting by a press advertisement of an infamatory wording, thus rendering it impossible for the local Executive Board to get the members\\' approval of the decision of the International, the -General Executive Board decided to give Local No. 17 an extension of time until March 1, 1918, to carry the decision into effect or stand expelled from the International. -Brother A. Ellner, manager of the Private Dressmakers\\' Union, Local No. 90, called the attention of the Board to the local situation. He stated that if this union is to increase its influence in the industry, and gain improvements for the workers it was necessary to prepare for a general strike. The union, he stated, has approximately 700 members, but the industry employs about 8,000 workers of various nationalities. Many French and American girls are working in the shops and stores, and it would be impossible to organize them systematically without a general strike. -The General Executive Board empowered the General Office to investigate the conditions of the trade, and if practical and feasible, a campaign for a general strike -Judge Jacob Panken appeared on behalf of the Naturalization Bureau and explained that the bureau was commencing a movement for assisting our elligible workers to become citizens of the United States. He said that never was the urgency for this movement greater than at present; first because the women of New York have been enfranchised, and upon married men securing full citizenship rights it will mean two votes for the labor movement. Secondly it should be remembered that in view of the great progress of the recent Socialist party campaign, the other parties will employ every possible means to obstruct our next campaign. Therefore we ought to prepare for eventualities by increasing the number of our voters. Funds were needed to carry on the work, and Judge Panken asked the General Executive Board to contribute a sum of money for -As the convention report has to be prepared, it was decided that President Schlesinger shall visit all the locals of the International for the purpose of ascertaining their present condition and aspirations, to enable the General Executive Board to present a comprehensive report to the convention. -It was reported that the Waistmakers* Union of Philadelphia had bought a Unity house with funds specially collected from shares issued to the members and sympathizers. A large number of its members have invested in this undertaking. The General Executive Board recognizing the importance of this enterprise and desiring to commend this noble example to other locals, decided to purchase 100 shares in the Unity House of Local No. 15. -Vice President J. Halperin; H. Wander; Fannia M. Cohn and Secretary Ab. Baroff were appointed as Convention Arrangements Committee. -Vice President Elmer Rosenberg; Salvatore Ninfo and S. Seidman were appointed a committee to draw up a plan of a weekly paper for our International Union and submit a report to the next meeting of the Board. -Toledo, Ohio, Feb. 9, 1918 We, the undersigned herewith certify that we have audited the expenses of the General officers for the months of October, November and December, and that we have found them duly vouched for and in accordance with law. -Immediately after our return from the last meeting of the Board at Montreal, we accepted the recommendation of the Montreal Joint Board to engage Brother Labensohn as its manager, and with Presi-During the month of November, right after Brother Labensohn was engaged as the Montreal organizer, a serious trouble arose in Montreal. It happened that some of the active union members among the finishers of the shop of M. Rother, one of the biggest in the town, were discriminated against and discharged, and the local Joint Board decided to call a strike in that shop. The operators of the shop, however, lined up with the employer and issued a circular in defiance of the order of the Joint Board. Foreseeing the demoralizing effect of thi% act of insubordination upon the Montreal organization, we sent VicePresident Halpern to Montreal early in December, for the purpose of adjusting the matter and bring the operators of that shop to their senses. Brother Halpern had spent a few days there and upon his return to New York reported that he had succeeded in convincing the operators of their wrong action; that they felt repentent and appointed a committee to see the employer and ask him to reinstate the finishers; that the employer refused to grant their demand and accused the operators of having acted in bad faith with him, as it was he who had given them the money to print circulars against the Joint Board; that he oflFered them individual agreements, by which they would bind themselves not to go down on strike while the agreement lasted, and they rejected these proposals. After Brother Halpern had left, we were informed that a strike was called in that shop by the operators. -The situation in the New York Cloak Operators\\' Union, Local No. 1, was not quite clear when we came from Montreal. The registration of the operators in the reorganized local was very slow, and there were a number of so-called \"peace-seekers\" who were hampering the work of the local elements of the union. During the last three months, however, the entire situation has cleared up excellently. Up to date about 6,000 cloakmakers have registered in the Internationa] local, which has moved into new headquarters. Recently local elections took place, and a new executive board and other officers were elected. A large vote was recorded despite the fact that the voting took place during the iist. -heatless days of last month. Vice Presidents Amdur, Lefkovits and myself acted in the committee which had examined the candidates for office and we had also assigned watchers at the ballot boxes. The newly elected officers of Local No. 1 were installed by President Schlesinger, and quite recently the event of the reorganization of the local was celebrated by Local No. 1, in conjunction with the International, at a banquet which was arranged on February 2nd at Beethoven Hall, and at which all the active workers of the New York unions and representatives of the International Union were present. -During January our New York locals had their regular annual elections for officers for the year 1918, and I installed practically all of them. On all of these occasions I found with a sense of deep gratification that our locals are intensely loyal and true to our International Union. The meeting of the Joint Board of New York, where the installation of delegates for the next year took place in January, was another source of satisfaction to me. The poisonous atmosphere which has been in the air there for years, created and spread by the treacherous and disloyal element, has vanished, and all the delegates showed determination to uphold harmony and unity in our ranks. We have, indeed, enough cause to congratulate ourselves upon the progress we have made during the last six months. -I also attended mass meetings of Locals No. 9 and No. 23, at which the conditions of the trade were discussed and remedies for the existing evils were sought. The idea of week work in the entire industry is getting strong support and increasing approval from our workers. -We have made arrangements at Baltimore to engage a man and a woman organizer in addition to Miss Anna Neary who has been working for the ladies* garment workers of Baltimore for a considerable time, as organizer for the American Federation of Labor. The arrangements were completed by President Schlesinger and took effect on January 3, 1918. Reports so far indicate that the new staff of organizers in Baltimore has undertaken a wide campaign to unionize the workers. -At the request of the Joint Board of Boston the General Office has agreed to contribute to the expenses of Brother Hyman Hurwitz, who was recently elected as their manager. He is an able young man, and his services can be utilized for organizing work in Worcester and other points around Boston. This arrangement has been in effect since December 27th, 1917. -As you already know, Vice-President Seidman was induced to come to New York to take up the position as Chief Clerk in the Waistmakers\\' Union, Local No. 25, and he may briefly report on the conditions in which he found the local. -I attended conferences between the Waistmakers* Union and the Waist and Dress Manufacturers\\' Association at which various demands were discussed. The employers had at first flatly refused to grant the demands, and the controversy was to go to the Board of Arbitration. However, President Schlesinger, together with Brothers Seidman and Lieberman, succeeded, after a number of conferences with the employers, in gaining increases of wages for the workers. Later some of the members of the Executive Board of Local No. 25 and some shop chairmen protested against the action of the conference committee for not acting in this matter in strict accord with democracy. But after two meetings with the Executive Board and also with the shop chairmen, at which President Schlesinger and I have been present, we succeeded in convincing them of the importance of these gains and of the increases. -I attended a meeting of Local No. 90, the Private Dressmakers, who have succeeded in building up a compact little local, but they are not satisfied because of the fact that their trade is a large one and is not yet thoroughly organized. They are anxious that the International give them a helping hand in organizing the workers all over the city. -The Children\\'s Dressmakers\\' Union, Local No. 50, has been progressing pretty well, \\'but lately a trouble of a personal nature has occurred, based, to my mind, on a feeling of petty jealousy. One of the office clerks, a member of the union, was guilty of -discourtesy to the manager of the local and he brought charges against her before the Executive Board of the local. The Executive Board decided that the young lady in question was to apologize for the insult, which she refused to do and sent in her resignation. The case would have ended right there but for one of the paid officers who wanted to get even with the manager. He organized some of the business agents of the local against the manager and started a turmoil, demanding that the Executive Board of Local No. 50 reconsider its decision. -A special meeting of the Executive Board and of the officers was called, at which President Schlesinger and myself were present. We went through the entire case, and President Schlesinger upheld the decision of the local Executive Board. Again it was thought that this would settle the controversy, but the forces that were working against the manager of Local No. 50 would not rest. An agitation was started among the chairladies of the local against the Executive Board. At a meeting of the Executive Board, at which I was present, a committee of the chairladies appeared with an ultimatum that if this girl were not reinstated they would refuse to act as chairladies in the shops. I tried to explain to them the injustice of their demand and made clear to them the duties and the responsibilities of the Executive Board of their union. Later I attended one of their members* meetings, where I learned that the members at large were loyal and faithful to their organization, and only a small group was acting in an irresponsible manner. -Local No. 20, our Raincoat Makers\\' Union of New York, is at present in a very good financial condition. Formerly they were always suffering from inability to make ends meet, and very often had to appeal to the International for financial assistance. They now have in their treasury over $10,000, and the trade is in a prosperous condition. -quested conferences with the employers* association of their trade, for the purpose of discussing an increase of wages for their workers to meet the extra cost of living. The manufacturers flatly refused these demands, and the local is preparing for aggressive steps in connection with this problem. (While the meeting was being held, at which this report was read, the manufacturers receded from their position and concede a satisfactory increase of wages. Ed.) -Local No. 6, the Embroidery Workers\\' Union of New York, made a similar request and received a similar answer from their manufacturers, and as a result they are likewise preparing to compel the employers, through strikes, to grant them their just -On December 11th a special joint meeting x>f the executive boards of all our locals in New York City was held at 7 East 15th Street, the People\\'s House, to devise plans of raising a large sum of money for the Jewish War Sufferers in Europe. At this meeting, which was attended by Louis Marshal] and Jacob H. Schiff, it was decided after deliberation that Washington\\'s Birthday be assigned as the day when all our workers will turn over their earnings as a donation to the fund for the Jewish War Sufferers. Plans have been mapped out, offices opened, and a campaign has been started to make this movement successful on a large scale. President Schlesinger is chairman of the committee, Phillip Kaplowitz is manager, Max D. Danish is secretary and I am the treasurer. The Relief Committee was appointed by President Schlesinger and consists of the following representatives of the different locals: Brothers Saul Metz, Jatfob Halperin, Fannia M. Cohn, Louis Langer, Bernat Fenster, Manny Weiss, Nathan M. Minkow, Isadore Epstein, Morris Brass, Jacob Heller, Philip Berman, Max Bruck, Meyer Weinstein, Sol Seidman, Abraham E. Kazan, Henry Zucker, Harry Greenberg, Morris Uran, Samuel Shore, Max Luboff, Samuel Lefkovits, Isidore Graff and Abraham Ellner. It has an Executive Committee which is composed of: Bcnj. Schlesinger, Abraham Baroff. Morris Sigman, Harry Wandor, Sol Seidman, Ossip Walinsky, Phillip Kaplowitz and Max D. Danish. -The initiation stamp reform, which was decided upon by the General Executive Board, went into effect on February 1st, 1918. After a meeting with all the secretaries of the large locals in New York City, we decided on a special card on which these stamps are to be pasted and which are to be the property of the applicants and serve as a receipt for the installment payments. We decided to charge one-half of one per cent, of the gross value of the stamps. In brief, the reasons for adopting the initiation stamp are as follows: (1) to be able to control the initiation income of the locals and (2) to impress more strongly upon the members of our local unions the fact of their being initiated as members of -I feel it my duty to report to you about our educational undertaking. The cost of the educational department to date amounts to $2,000, and now our weekly expenses are from $150 to $200 per week. I was at the opening of the International courses at the Washington Irving High School, also at Public School No. 62, on the East Side. These were quite successful affairs. I am not in a position, however, to state how far we have met with success in the conduct of the courses. I know it is a very hard and slow process and I also know that Vice-President Fannia Cohn has been working very hard ever since she was engaged by the Educational Committee to promote this work. She is constantly busy organizing the committees in the locals, keeping in touch with the students and trying her best to interest the locals in the importance of the work. I also wish to say that the entire burden has so far been left by the Educational Committee which was appointed by President Schlesinger, on the shoulders of the paid officers, and Brother E. Lieberman, the chairman of the committee.. The vice-presidents and the other members of the Educational Committee as a whole, have interested themselves very little with the work of this department. My opinion is that President Schlesinger might have a meeting with this Committee, and if he is satisfied that the members of the Educational Committee do not attend to their duties, it would be advisable to appoint others instead. -At your last Quarterly Meeting, held in October, we submitted a report, setting forth a plan for our educational activities. In this report we shall review in brief the work which has been accomplished so far. -The opening celebration of the International center was held in the auditorium of the Washington Irving High School on December 1st, 1917. Every local of our International Union in New York City was represented. The spirit of the members, and, in fact, of all present, was a very admirable one. All felt that .this new activity of our International commands the highest respect of the members and deserves serious attention. -Soon after the opening, registration for the various courses began. At this present time the following courses are being given at the International center: -The courses are being satisfactorily attended, the average attendance being about 200. Most of the students take more than one course. We believe that these courses will greatly benefit our members, and through them, our various organizations. -The conditions in our country, especially the coal situation, has greatly hindered our original plans. We have been unable to proceed with the opening of the local centers, as we intended to do. Some of the schools were temporarily closed and no permits were given for the use of schools on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. We were even obliged to secure other headquarters for our International center, and at this present time the courses of the International center are being given in the Public Library at 328 East 23rd Street. We were very fortunate in securing the use of -this building. However, our committee Was determined to carry on the work in spite of all obstacles. Accordingly, we have already opened a down-town center in Public School No. 62, the opening celebration of which was held on Friday, February 1st, 1918. The courses in this center will be given mainly in Jewish, and are as follows: -Tuesdays will be devoted to instruction in health. A lecture on some important health topic will be given under the supervision of the Joint Board of Sanitary Control. Gymnasium practice will be given by Miss Lucy M. Retting, physical director. -Besides, every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, classes in English, elementary and advanced, will be conducted. The Board of Education has promised to provide teachers for the English classes. -Due to the coal situation, we have postponed the opening of a center in Brownsville, but the demand for such a center is so great that we feel it cannot be postponed any longer. More than 250 members have registered for courses and they insist that they be given the same opportunity as the members in New York. We are therefore making arrangements now to open a center there in Public School No. 84, Glenmore and Stone Avenues, where a similar schedule to the downtown center will be given. -As you see, no eflForts have been spared in extending our educational activities. We realize that all these activities may be a financial burden on our International, and we therefore called a conference of the Educational Committees of our locals, to devise some means by which the burden upon the treasury of our International shall be diminished. The conference decided to recommend to the locals to appropriate 5c per member for this season of our activities. That, we figured, after making the necessary deductions, would give us more than $2,000.00 to carry on the work. Having the necessary funds, we intended to extend our work to other cities, especially Philadelphia and Boston. In fact, they requested our chairman to visit their cities and to assist them in working out a feasible plan for educational activities. However, -President Schlcsinger was utterly opposed to raising any money through the locals for this purpose at the present time, and also to inaugurating similar work in other cities. Nothing was left for us, therefore, but to continue our work in its present form. -Beginning Monday, February 11th, Professor Charles A. Beard will begin a course on the Economic History of the United States, at the Washington Irving High School. It is needless for us to dwell upon the tremendous importance of such a course, given by such an eminent authority. We feel greatly gratified in having secured the valuable assistance of Professor Beard. His connection with us will greatly strengthen our work and add prestige to our Workers\\' University. At the same time we will also start a course in practical problems of trade unionism. Various lectures will be gfiven on this topic, by such prominent lecturers as Morris Hilquit, Robert Bruere, John Fitch and Dr. N. I. Stone. This course will begin on Friday, February 15th, with a lecture by Morris Hillquit on collective bargaining in the garment trades. -We feel that our agitation for educational work has borne fruit. The spirit among our members and the desire for such activities has been greatly stimulated. The possibilities of this work are great. We have proh ably made mistakes, but we are certain that we are on the right path. We sincerely hope that this work will be encouraged by the active cooperation of the General Executive Board. -Lafayette, Ind. — Officers of the Retail Clerks\\' International Protective association report that 80 charters have been issued during the past 12 months. -Large sums of money have been expended in benefits, it is stated, and these have not been confined to sick and funeral benefits alone, but a goodly sum has been appropriated for strike benefits and other relief. -(In this department^ which is a regular feature of this Journal every month, local life and movement is being reported for the information of our members and readers.) -Brother Wm. Bloom, Secretary, reports: — \"The new office of Local No. 1 is a beehive of activity. We already feel at home in our new headquarters. Over 6,500 cloak operators are paying regular dues on our books, and these are members in the full sense of the word. They have learned from bitter experience of the painful results disorganization and demagogy bring in their wake, and they have resolved not to be misled by unscrupulous and irresponsible men in the future. The effects of the trouble that occurred in the Cloak Operators* Union during the past year will serve as a great object lesson to the Jewish labor movement in general. The spirit of irresponsible demogag^ has met its deserved rebuke. Our International Union struck a blow at the enemies of organized labor who were parading as its friends in an ultra-revolutionary mask for mean and selfish purposes. -\"The great question that is agitating the mass of the cloak operators today is the week work system which is now being discussed everywhere as the next big step in the improvement of the working conditions of our men and women. In fact, about one hundred shops have already adopted the week work system instead of piece work and results are quite satisfactory from the reports that have reached our office. The referendum vote on the week work system will soon be submitted by the Joint Board to the cloak shops, and it appears, from all signs, that a big majority will be recorded for the introduction of this great reform in the lives of the cloakmakers in New York City. The International convention will, no doubt, endorse this movement and will make week work a standard in the entire cloak industry of the country.\" -\"The spring season is in full bloom in Philadelphia just now and our cloakmakers say that they can hardly recall such a busy spring season. It may be due, to a certain extent, to the fact that there are fewer cloakmakers today in Philadelphia than ever. A number of them are working on army uniforms, and then again, it may be true that our employers have very large orders this spring. At any rate, the shops are very busy and in some factories there is a scarcity of workers. In spite of that, we have complaints that in many factories the people are not making a living and the prices are far from desirable. This is due mainly to the fact that when work first appeared in the shops, some volunteer price committees began settling prices on the garments, being very eager to get started on the work. It would have been much better for themselves and the workers m their shops if these self-appointed committees had waited a couple of weeks before settling prices. As it is, they have no one but themselves to blame, because it is very hard to rectify these mistakes at present. -\"In other shops where the price committees acted with less haste and in accordance with the instructions from our office, things are much better, and the workers make from $50 to $60 a week. But these shops are exceptions; the ordinary wages range from $20 to $30 a week. In some shops we have succeeded in making re-settlements, but even these do not make up for the losses, because the seasons are short and the cost of living is mounting higher from day to day. -nestly discussed At this meeting some of the oldest cloakmakers in our city were present, and men who have been for tens of years in cloak shops agreed that the only solution for the evils of the cloak trade is the adoption of week work. It was decided to recommend to the Joint Board to take up the discussion of week work with all our branches and to arrange for one general mass meeting, at which this matter should be decided once for all. It is yet hard to say what most of the workers think of week work, biit on the surface it appears that the majority of our members here in Philadelphia are inclined to adopt this system.\" -\"The idea of forming a Joint Board of the International locals of Baltimore — Locals Nos. 4, 12, 101 and 110, which was put into effect several months ago, appears to have been the most desirable thing for our Baltimore organization. Full credit for the success of the venture must be given to our International President, Brother Schlesinger, who, during his last visit to Baltimore, inspired the local workers to give their full support to the Joint Board and to conduct the organization work in a much improved manner. -\"Local No. 4 is doing all within its power to help organize the other three locals. Only recently a decision was adopted by this local to the effect that each shop chairman in the cloak shops be instructed to demand that the cutters of the shop must belong to the Cutters\\' Union, Local No. 110, and that in case they refuse to join this organization, the cloakmakers are to refrain from working with them. The results of this decision have already proved to be excellent, and the cutters\\' local has been growing ever since. -\"The Ladies\\' Tailors, Local, No. 101, has been making good strides lately, with the assistance of our able organizer. Brother D. Cohen, and at present they are doing work on a real solid basis. The tailors are settling prices in their shops thorugh their own shop committees, and conditions are quite satisfactory. -workers. Our organizers are spending a good deal of energy and time in organizing the women workers, who are largely Gentile, but these are coming into the organization at a very slow pace. Personally, I am inclined to think that the road in these trades will be a hard one to travel. -\"We had elections here on February 9th, and Brother A. Ratkowitz was re-elected for the third time as business agent of Local No. 4, and as assistant organizer of all the other locals. We raised his salary owing to the present high cost of living. -\"It was decided to tax every member of Local No. 4 ten per cefit. on the week\\'s wages for the week of February 22nd, for the War Relief Fund, and we have appealed to the brothers and sisters of our local organization to keep their promises and to donate freely and of their own accord. We hope that the feeling of sympathy toward our stricken brothers and sisters in Europe will materialize in a substantial sum of money and will relieve some broken down lives and hearts to some degree.\" ♦ ♦ * -\"The spring season is here, and during the last few weeks its influence has been felt in all the shops. From all signs the season will be a pretty good one. The manufacturers admit that in spite of the fact that the price of materials is higher than before, they have received larger orders than they did for the last spring season. The shops are being filled up with workers who are leaving their temporary occupations and coming back to work at their trades. -\"The Joint Board decided at its last meeting to make Saturday, the 16th of March, the relief day for our unfortunate sisters and brothers across the seas. We are making all arrangements to render this day a great success. We chose the 16th of March because we expect the season to be at its height at that time, and our workers will therefore be in a better position to contribute part of their earnings. -\"The news that President Schlesinger was instrumental in obtaining exemption for the garment trades from the late Monday closing order, has created a great sensa-tion in Boston. The manufacturers, on the one hand, and the workers on the other, are beginning to realize that our organization wields a tremendous moral force in the economic life of our country. -\"The news that Boston has been selected by the members of the International in the just closed referendum vote, as the next convention city, has filled the hearts of our workers with joy. We eagerly expect the arrangements committee of the International to come to Boston to make preparations for the convention, and we shall endeavor to help them in every possible way to make this convention a memorable one in the history of the International Union.*\\' -Vice-President Schoolman writes: — \"The most interesting occurrence of the past month is undoubtedl> the beginning of the spring season. Indeed, all of us are glad that the slack period is over. It brought a good deal of privation to our members, as all slack seasons do, and the conditions were aggravated during the last few months on account of the general bad times that prevailed in our city. -\"We are not as yet in a position to say whether this season will meet with our expectations. We are assured, however, that there will be enough work in the shops. But these assurances have come to us in the beginning of every season, and these cheerful reports usually come from the employers and the trade. I wonder if they are not really inspired by the ulterior motive of making our people believe that in view of the fact that there will be so much work to do, the workers might make the garments at lower prices? -\"A home owned by our own Union; a little corner for ourselves; a place that we can point out as belonging cooperatively to our organization, is the present cry of a large number of our members. The very fact that our workers are thinking of an enterprise of this kind is cheerful news to all of us. The days when the Chicago cloakmakers thought of nothing else but of his own machine and bundle are apparently passing away and a spirit of unity is taking its place. -\"Our Strike Fund has during the past year increased considerably and we now have about $6,000 in that Fund. We have no reason to doubt that the coming year will swell this Fund up to $10,000, a sum which we set as our goal at the time of its inauguration. Of course, we are not quite as naive as to think that we can successfully conduct a general strike with such a small sum, but we are certain that we could handle a single or a group strike with our own means. -\"Our Sick Fund is in very good shape. Of course, it is not pleasant to report that we had 211 sick cases last year and that these received about $3,000 support from the Fund; but it is better that we have a fund to take care of these sick members than to leave them in their misery without any support . whatever. The Sick Fund has on hand now $4,623.01, and we hope that we may not have to use much of it for the coming year. Five members of our organization died within the last year and their families received death benefit. -\"Owing to the strict supervision of the shops through the button system, our members are in pretty good standing all the time. The last slack period, however, made some inroads into the credit side of our ledger. Some members have fallen into arrears and they come to the office to complain that they are being interfered with now in their work, as tney have not an up-to-date button. Others did not receive their sick benefits on account of that, and still others could not get loans from the union for the same reason. We have strict and fast rules, however, in this particular matter, and the union insists first and last that dues must be paid under all circumstances. It involves the very existence of the organization. We have proposed to our members to start a campaign in each shop among the delinquent members to pay up their arrears during the bulsy season. Both these men and the union will profit by this, and the shop chairmen are depended upon to do their duties in this respect. Our Savings Department -pected how many cloakmakcrs had savings accounts in the local banks. We have discovered a considerable number of them, but we had our misgivings at the beginning as to whether these people would bring their money into the savings department of the union. We had in mind a number of cloakmakers who save only from season to season and eat up their little savings during the slack period. This type of cloakmaker very seldom visits the savings bank, and his money, which usually consists of $100 or less, is kept by him or his wife within the confines of the house. For this type of cloakmaker we really started our savings department. The Union gives the depositor full guarantee for his money and keeps it for him in a national bank, paying two per cent, interest on it. We expect that the convenience of depositing and the unusual accommodations that the union offers the members for withdrawing the money, will attract a great many members to this institution and will eventually redound to the benefit of our members.\" -**I wrote you in my last report that we expected President Schlesinger in our city. As he came for one day only, we could not get the cloakmakers together for a general meeting, but we had a meeting of the Executive Board and discussed the demands that we were to present to the employers. Brother Schlesinger, advised us not to make general demands to all the manufacturers and suggested that we tackle individual shops. Another matter which we agreed upon was a raise of wages in all the shops, and this matter was also to be taken up in groups of shops at a time. -\"We at once tackled this proposition and sent out letters to three firms, asking for an increase of 20 per cent for piece workers, and for week workers — $2.00 for men and $1.00 for women. After a few days* negotiations, we won an increase of 12% per cent, for piece workers, the above mentioned raises for the week workers and the full recognition of the union. In this way we went successfully from shop to shop. We had a strike in only one shop, that of Greenberg & Rupp, which is considered -the best cloak house in the city. This shop was a strictly anti-union house until now, and we had a strike for a week until we succeeded in getting a full union agreement, and we unionized the shop completely. I am confident that before the month is over all the cloakmakers in this city will have gained the increase. -\"The season is now in full swing here. There is plenty of work in the shops and our people are working excessive overtime. Our cloakmakers will not understand that long hours of overtime will not lengthen their season. The seasons in the cloak trade would surely start four or five weeks earlier than usual if our employers knew that the workers would refuse to work from twenty to thirty hours overtime weekly. The Montreal cloakmakers, however, are shortsighted and do not understand their interests. -\"The appeal of the General Office to all the locals to participate in the relief movement for the war sufferers, found a strong echo in Montreal. At a general members\\' meeting the question was discussed and our members, realizing the importance of this undertaking, decided to contribute part of their earnings for this desirable purpose. -\"The organization work in our city is going along comparatively slowly. In the past we used to be able to organize all the workers in the trade in a period of a few weeks. At present, however, we have adopted different methods, and we are going to organize the local people on a more solid basis. In past years we were anxious to take in members at $1.00 per head just for the sake of giving them books, and it was an easy matter, therefore, to enroll them. In this manner w^e used to deceive ourselves with the thought that we already had a solid union in Montreal. But after the first flush of excitement was over, the members and the union drifted away, and it was necessary to start the thing all anew. At present, however, a man must pay dues in order to be regarded as a union member, and a new member must pay his full initiation fee before he is admitted. -The shop where I worked was one of the many shops to be found downtown. The longest hours and the smallest wages prevailed there. The lon^ hours, however, were not so oppressive and difficult to bear as the g^oss insults to which the forty or so Jewish girls were subjected by the employer and particularly by his foreman, who excelled the employer in coarseness, impudence and cynical insinuations. -Agitators, both men and women, repeatedly attempted to organize the women workers of such shops, but their efforts met with scant success. Jaded and physically exhausted from overwork, our wills to fight against our oppressors were blunted and our spirit of resistance was enfeebled. What was especially lacking in us was the hope and faith that anyone could really -help us. Excepting a few girls who possessed stronger faith and more energy, none of us ever went to the meeting called by the union. Thus the slavery in our shop grew and bore us down with its weight; and the more the slavish yoke fastened itself around our necks the less able we felt to shake it off. -This continued for many weary months and even years. ... It was three years since I had been working there. Yet there was no possibility even for me to leave the shop. There were not many shops in this trade, which manufactured a specific kind of work, a certain line of sweaters. -And who knows how long this system of bondage would have continued in the shop if not for an accident with an apple. It was this that set us free -\"We have a strike on hand here for a cause that may appear peculiar to you. We work by the week in San Francisco, and we like the system pretty well. In fact, until recently, none of the local firms ever attempted to introduce the piece work system in the shops. Lately, however, two firms attempted to start piece work, and the cloakmakers showed a determined front to oppose this system, which they regard as injurious to their interests. Things went so far that we decided to strike in any shop that might attempt to force the issue on this question. Just now the workers of the Unique Cloak & Suit Company of this city are on strike against the piece work system. We are certain of winning this strike and we expect it to be an effectual lesson to the local manufacturers, and that their dream of piece work will be abandoned forever. -from the insults of the boss and the foreman, reduced our hours of labor, increased our wages and taught us to stand up for our human rights and rights as women. It taught us to rise like one man against wrong and abuse committed against us. -One day there came to work in our shop a young girl, whose appearance was almost that of a child. . . . During the first few days she cast furtive, pitiful glances around her, as if in quest of someone to help and protect her. She impressed us as one who had been affectionately fondled, in fact, as all young girls to whom work in a shop is a new, unpleasant experience. From time to time she opened her white bag which was suspended from her neck as is the habit with oriental shepherdesses, took out a small slice of buttered bread, and eating it rapidly, stealthily, to conceal the fact from the boss and foreman. She evidently enjoyed a good appetite.. It was also possible that she thereby sought relief from the weary monotony of the work. -Once she drew out from her bag a beautiful red apple and bit into it with her small, white teeth. The juice moistened her fresh, red lips which looked like two roses sparkling with the early morning devr. . . . She seemed to have been absent-minded at the time, forgetting that she was in the shop, for her hand holding the apple was slightly stretched out. Now the boss suddenly appeared, and seeing her thus with the apple in her hand he grew furious with rage. This chit, he thought, did not seem to feel that she was in his shop, but as if at home with her parents. He came up to her with his accustomed stare out of his bulging gray eyes and burst out: -The young soul lost herself, and instead of answering his question, not knowing what to answer, she naively smiled to him. -The boss was boiling over with indignation. Did she mean to annoy him, then? He snatched the apple from her hand and flung it into the basket that stood some distance awav. -All the girl workers of the shop were deeply stirred at this scene. It seemed to them that she was not weeping for the loss of the apple, but for the loss of the fresh bloom of her youth of which the boss robbed her by his arbitrary harsh act. -And ^hen we did not need any agitators, leaflets or proclamations. The fresh rosy apple so malignantly torn from the young girl\\'s hand, and her piteous sobs, aroused an overpowering feeling of protest in our hearts and awakened the light of reason in our dulled, torpid minds. -Upon leaving the factory after work we decided to come to the shop the next day each one with an apple, and that at a given signal by one of us all should bite into their apples at the same time. -And alone the eflFect of this decision made everyone feel as if freed from a heavy yoke. We felt sure of victory. -Two o\\'clock the next day I gave the signal. Every one of us put aside our work. Forty girls all reached for their red apples from their bags, and, as if at the behest of an invisible commander, everyone bit into her apple. -Apple juice ran on every lip, but inwardly all hearts derived force and will-power from the daring act. -The boss and foreman stood as if petrified, and in the first few moments they were so bewildered as to seem unable to move a limb. Soon, however, the foreman recovered and then the boss. -\\'Apple! apples! apples!\" all exclaimed with one voice. It was the voice of triumph reverberating throughout the shop. -Now this shop is one of the freest in the downtown district. We are not only free to eat apples, but to sing songs, and the work is now easier. Having tasted with the apple the sweet sense of freedom, we ceased to be slaves. -42.

We shall not come there to heal wounds, ventilate grievances or straighten out internal feuds. This time we shall assemble at the convention with the main purpose of doing constructive work — ^planning new departures and ascending new heights which we had no time or opportunity to approach before. -The question of week work will probably occupy the first and foremost place in this program of constructive work. After a long campaign of agitation, of education through our press and by mass meetings the New York Joint Board has submitted the question of week work to a referendum vote of the workers in the cloak trade. The great mass of cloakmakers have learned to understand the inequality inherent in the old piece work system and the absolute necessity of replacing it by a system of week work, and they will express their convictions in this referendum vote. -Then will begin the most important work for the International Union, and this remains for the convention to deliberate upon. In theory week work is a necessity and a good thing. Week work will render it possible to build up a strong organization. It will enable the union to have complete control over the shops and factories. It will do away with nine-tenths of all shop troubles growing out of disputes over prices. -It will save the workers\\' money and energy. It will remove the cause of friction and ill-feeling between individual employers and their workers and between one worker and another of the same or of various shops. Week work inspires the hope that in time it will be possible so to organize the trade and so to arrange the work, as to distribute it more or less over the entire year, and this would be a \"blessing to the workers. -All these points we had made clear to the workers by a prolonged agitation before we submitted the question to the vote. But as already mentioned, this is only the theoretical side of the question. It will devolve upon the convention to consider its practical side and elaborate the details of effecting the change. -We shall have to consider the proposed scale of wages for the Workers of the various crafts and must outline a mode of procedure with the manufacturers in presenting the demand, defining the nature of preparations in case we encounter unforeseen obstacles. So far, it is not certain what attitude the employers will take upon the question. Obviously, if the workers think that -week work will benefit them, it might not please the employers. If the workers expect to derive advantages from the proposed change it might arouse the employers\\' suspicions. Therefore the convention must decide on certain preparation for all kinds of trouble with the manufacturers and map out a plan of action. -The question of week work is an old one and may be regarded as half completed. I want to discuss now two new constructive propositions that the convention will have to dispose of because they are of the highest importance. -1. The introduction for all the members of our locals of benefit funds directly controlled by our International Union. -I have spoken and written of benefit funds on many and various occasions. I have always believed that a union should enter thoroughly into all questions touching the workers* economic life. An active, vigorous union must hold its members closely attached to itself not only with the bond of improved wages and hours in the shop but with all other bonds of importance to the life of the worker and his family. -The union must regard it as part of its task to help and protect the worker in all his needs and difficulties. It must consider itself as the worker\\'s mainstay in life, and make it possible for him to come to the union whenever he is in trouble and distress, and leave in its hands the fortunes and destiny of his wife and children if fate should deprive them of his life. -This should be the ideal of every great and powerful labor union. The worker\\'s needs and economic problems by no means end with the shop or his wages. True, the shop and his wages are of primary importance, but they are not his only needs. The trade union which fails to take into account all other needs and material requirements of its members saps its own vital strength. Only that union is truly strong which takes an abiding interest in all that affects the worker and his* family at all crucial moments of their material existence. -All the great unions of the country recognize this principle and all of them have sundry benefit funds based on the peculiar circumstances surrounding the trade and the members. In trades where the workers are subject to tuberculosis the unions provide cures in sanitariums. Where unemployment is rife and the slack seasons unduly long, they have out-of-work funds. Sick funds are very general. The principle of insurance against sickness and distress is widely recognized, and every organization strives to give effect to it as far as possible. -In our union this vital principle has been almost neglected. Until recently we have not looked at the affairs of the union from this comprehensive point of view. We have regarded the union from the narrow, confined limits of strikes and wages. For this our special circumstances are mainly to blame. So long as an element of insecurity entered into the situation, so long as the union rested on an unstable foundation, it was impossible to devote time and attention to matters outside wages and -hours. We were in duty bound to concentrate on one thing — assure the foundation of the union. -Now, however, the situation is altogether different. Our locals are firmly established. We are regarded as one of the exemplary labor organizations in the land. Now it would be criminal to neglect these reforms. Now it is our duty to provide for a systematic protection of our members against recurring slackness and hardships. -At the convention, which will begin in Boston next month, our International Union must make a start in introducing benefits for its members. I do not believe that it is necessary to effect this reform at one bound. We should proceed slowly and deliberately, but we must make a beginning without delay. -The convention ought to decide that upon the death of a member in good standing, if affiliated with the union for a year, his family should be paid from the treasury of the International Union the sum of $500, and such payments should be covered by a special assessment levied on the entire membership at the end of every three months. -Thus, for instance, if in course of any three months twenty deaths should be recorded, the families of the deceased members — their widows or other legal heirs — should be immediately and without delay paid from the treasury of the International $500 in each case, and the total sum of $10,000 should subsequently be covered by a tax on theentire membership. At the end of the three months the International Union should publish the names of the twenty deceased members and the names and addresses of their heirs to whom the money has been paid. The 100,000 members of the International Union should then be called upon to cover the disbursed sum of $10,000 by a levy of 10 cents on each member. -This is, perhaps, not the best way of paying death benefits. It would be better to have a fixed assessment or dues for this purpose regardless of the sums disbursed every three months — an assessment sufficient to cover all possible expenses incurred in connection with this benefit. But as a beginning the system of distributing the assessment in proportion to the payment would be more practicable. First, because it will thus be possible to ascertain what the average assessment should be. Secondly, every member will know that he pays just as much as is necessary to maintain the fund. It will not be suggested by anyone that the union profits by the system. Thirdly, the special assessment every three months will bring home to the members the good and useful object achieved by this fund. Those who will pay the asse;3sment will feel that their dimes have gone to help widows and orphans of their former fellow workers and will strengthen their faith in the importance of keeping up the fund. Then, as the membership will grow accustomed to the mortuary fund, it will be possible to arrange it on the same basis as other regular payments to the union, for the regular payment system is really the easiest and -2. The second important proposition that will come before the convention is not altogether new. It was discussed at previous conventions and partial solutions were decided upon. But the time was not ripe to put those solutions into practice and they had to be postponed. Now, however, the time has cpme to carry out a fundamental reform. It is urgedly necessary that the existing wasteful and injurious system should not be permitted to continue. -I am referring here to our press. Our locals and the International Union are now spending more money on various local publications than any other international union, and we derive less benefit from our press than other unions from their publications. -A number of our big locals have each their own local organ. Some locals are publishing several organs in English, Yiddish and Italian. Independently of these the International is publishing its official magazine. -The result is that avoidable misunderstanding and disharmony are created. The editor of every publication regards himself as the responsible person to impose his opinion on the union as to what should be or should not be done. If the editorship falls into the hands of a certain clique the paper is apt to stir up passion ^nd friction among the members of the various locals and place the entire organization in jeopardy. I have no doubt that many of the troubles that have occurred in the Cloakmakers\\' Union would never have been so serious if not for these separate publications. -Secondly, the locals having separate organs are incurring an unnecessary expense. There is not a single international union in the country which throws out so much treasure on printing papers and journals as the locals of our International Union. Tens of thousands of dollars are thus wasted every year. -Thirdly, this system does more harm than good. The object of trade publications is to broaden the members\\' views, teach and educate them. But under the present system the effect produced is the opposite of that intended. The separate local publication confines itself to narrow craft interests and the reader fails to learn about the wider interests and more general labor questions affecting the members of the International as a whole. Psychologically the cloakmaker is apt to become a more confirmed cloakmaker by reading his local organ exclusively. Similarly is the case with the waistmaker, and so forth. -This must be changed. All the present publications must be merged into one general International weekly organ having various departments for the various trades and a general department for general trade union and Interational questions. A publication of this kind would be a true educational medium for our members. By means of such an organ they would become conversant with the whole organization, its various trades and activities in all centers of industry. -So long as there were inner disputes within the union it was hard to carry out this reform. The effort to effect it might have been misinterpreted. The International officers might have been charged with making an attempt to \"suppress\" the opinions of a section of the members, to deny them the right of free press, and so forth. Consequently we postponed the matter and have waited. Now such a charge can not be made. Peace and harmony prevails in all the local [organizations. It cannot be insinuated that there is politics behind the plan. All the delegates will now consider the question logically and with unbiassed minds and will have to admit that we are right in demanding this reform. -We must have one general great union organ edited by capable journalists and writers — an organ which should reach all our members and inform them of all that is happening in our extensive organization. It should also be the medium for educating our members in all general questions which have a close and vital bearing upon the workers\\' life and labor. -If we had a 100 per cent, organization ; if our locals succeeded in abolishing the evils from which we suffer; if our large membership took an abiding interest in all the affairs and activities of our local unions, no new issues would arise. Then it tvould be impossible for false messiahs to mislead our members. -Many suggestions have been made for improving the labor conditions of our members, and while we are seeking to remedy the evils and benefit our organization, we are met by the fact that the present form of our local organization is largely responsible for our failing to reach a 100 per cent, membership and for the lack of interest in their local unions on the part of the members. -In the Ladies\\' Garment Worker for the months of January, February and March the question whether our form of local organization is the correct one is dealt with clearly and logically by a well-informed contributor. -The writer calls attention to many truths, and as I am almost sure that this earnest question will come before our next convention, I suggest specially to the prospective delegates to the convention to make a thorough study of the articles alluded to, so as to become familiar with this and other questions discussed in our official journal. -The form of organization proposed by this writer is that of small locals not exceeding 500 members — an idea which is new to us. -Instinctively we have always supported the idea of small locals. At all our conventions the resolutions calling for one big union have been defeated. Our delegates have felt that the big local is not the best form of organization. If so, why have they embodied in our constitution Section 4 of Article II, which reads : \"No more than one charter shall be granted to any branch of the trade in any city or locality without the consent of the existing local union\"? -As first glance it seems that this law prohibits small locals, because it has been construed to mean that all engaged in the local trade shall belong to one local. But it is almost certain that the authors of this law were actuated by another reason. They feared that if more than one local was permitted to exist in one city, it would hinder the enforcement of equal wages and piece prices, or a uniform standard of labor conditions. Each local might present separate demands to the\\' employers. This would cause destructive competion between the members of the locals and cause misunderstandings which would divide their forces and benefit only the employers. Thus the aforesaid law was adopted to insure unity among the workers in the trade. -It should be borne in mind that at the time the said paragraph was made part of our constitution no one could foretell with any degree of certainty how the form of our organization would develop and work out in practice. Joint boards were a new feature in our unions and it could not then be foreseen how this delegated body would regulate the relations betweens its affiliated locals, or with what skill or efficiency it would guard the interests of the workers and carry on negotiations with the manu. facturers. -Now that we know that the joint boards, in the last eight years, have demonstrated their ability to protect the interests of all their members of whatever local and to maintain the integrity of the union, the idea of one big union in every city or branch of trade has outlived its usefulness. Now it is desirable to enquire whether the reorganization of our big lodals into smaller units would not bring new life and spirit into our members. -T-he indifference of our members to the union and their non-attendance at meetings has caused me many a sleepless night. At such times painful and -gnawing reflections would trouble my heart and mind: namely, \"Perhaps we are totally mistaken; perhaps our wish to have stable unions is only a dream, for the masses do not attend the meetings and are indifferent.\" -But soon the gloom would be dispelled by the memory of a chain of remarkable struggles waged by the same members. Visualizing their tremendous enthusiasm, their persistence and devotion in great strikes, my optimism would return. Surely, I told myself, our members are capable of evincing enthusiasm for the ideal of unity and of appreciating the meaning of solidarity in time of peace. Surely there is a cause for their present indifference. We have hoped that in time the situation would improve, but as there has been no change we have finally come to the conclusion that the only means of stimulating our members to an intelligent interest and activity in our organization is through smaller local tmions. -It is simply impossible to get in touch with all the members of a big local and arouse their interest in its affairs or move them to attend the local meeting. The very knowledge that the local has thousands of members provides everyone with a ready excuse. Everyone thinks that the meeting will have a large attendance without him or her. Everyone hopes that his or her duty will be performed by someone else; and those who attend the meeting feel disgusted because of the small attendance. Almost at every meeting one of the items for discussion is how to stimulate the interest of the members and secure their attendance at meetings. Gradually the disappointment with this condition grows to such an extent that even those who attended the meetings become remiss in their dut\\\\\\', telling themselves that they do not achieve any purpose by their attendance, and that the officers and executive board will take care of the members* interests. The suspicious member, on the other hand, is disposed to blame the officers for this state of affairs. It seems to him that the officers do not want the members to have a voice in the management of the imion. This aggravates the -indifference and leads to demoralization. But if our local membership did not exceed 500, it would be possible for the secretary to be in frequent correspondence with every member. He would know who attends and who does not attend the meetings, and would communicate with the latter and so arouse their interest. -Furthermore, our locals require a certain number of active members, to serve on the executive boards and on committees. In a local of thousands there is no opportunity for all active members to be chosen as executive board officers ; hence we find in every local only a certain number of active spirits who nearly always serve on boards and committees, whether the local consists of 300 or 10,000 members. For in the big locals the initiative rests solely with the officers, and there is a tendency for the smaller locals to follow in this respect the example of the former. Consequently many of our members are active in various political and progressive organizations. They have energy and enterprise, but as they find no outlet therefor in their local union, they gravitate to other fields of activity. I do not mean to say that other organizations connected with the labor movement are not sufficiently important, but I wish to stress the point that we simply lose many intelligent persons who would be helpful in the active work of our union if an opportunity were afforded them. -In smaller locals such members would find an outlet for their energies. In many locals a larger number of members would find an opportunity to serve the cause and share the responsibility for the welfare of the union. -Smaller locals afford an opportimity for closer contact between one member and another, resulting in new ideas and plans for the benefit of the union. -Let us not look at this new idea of smaller locals with fear and suspicion. If carried out it is sure to be attended by beneficial results— closer unity, a more efficient control and a greater interest in their local affairs. -In rhy first article \"Our Next Convention,\" published in the Ladies\\' Garment Worker for February, I promised to touch upon a long list of questions, and I shall deal with them briefly here. The Question of Education -Almost at all our conventions many resolutions call for educational activity. At our last convention it was decided to create a special Educational Committee and an annual outlay of $5,000 was appropriated for the purpose. -The Educational Committee will, no doubt, present its report to the convention of the work accomplished in the six months of its active life. -To me it is clear that if our aim is the intellectual development of all our members, $5,000 a year is an insignificant sum. Our educational work is a long process. The bulk of our membership do not seem eager to seize the opportunity we are now affording them. -Why are most of our members indifferent to our educational endeavor? Why this contradiction ? When we meet in convention a loud, insistent cry is raised that we must provide educational facilities. But when we establish a university for the members it is received with indifference. -There are, of course, psychological causes. One of these in particular is the growing anxiety to make ends meet. Our members are so weighted down by this all-absorbing care that their souls\\' longing to shake off their ignorance is practically benumbed. Therefore we shall have to reconsider the aim of our educational work. -If, however, we aim to keep up the present educational department for individual members only, the sum appropriated for the purpose may be utilized successfully in enabling individual members to get the necessary education which will fit them as local leaders. -Thus it should be clear for the deleeates to the convention that with the limited finances which our International Union can spend for educational purposes it is impossible to carry out an educational scheme for all its members. -This being the case, the question is — does the educational benefit derived by individual members justify us in using the per capita of the International for the purpose? -The question of our monthly magazine will surely crop up again at the forthcoming convention. The General Executive Board feels that an International Union like ours must have its own official publication. Yet with all our efforts to improve the literary and trade features of our official journal, we have not accomplished the desired results. We have therefore reached the conclusion that our International Union should publish a weekly paper instead^ of some of our locals publishing their own local organs. The present state of affairs is not conducive to the formulation of one imiform policy by the International for the entire industry and all its locals. For this reason it is absolutely necessary to amalgamate all our publications and ere-, ate One weekly organ which should express the policy of our entire organization — an organ which should reflect as in a mirror the life and actjvity of all the locals of the International Union. It is to be hoped that at this. convention the delegates will deal with the question of our press intelligently and decide upon a wise and practical course. -Since recently the co-operative idea has been to a limited extent acted upon in two of our locals — the Waist and Dressmakers* Union, Local No. 15 of Philadelphia and the Cloak Pressers* Union, Local No. 35 of New York. The limited form of co-operation has created much enthusiasm among the membership of these locals. -Co-operation is one of the important things \\' that our International Union should encourage among its members. By co-operative enterprise we might guard our people against the exorbitance of the food speculators who rob them of their earnings. All our gains in wages shrink as a result of the speculators\\' predatory methods. And if we decide that our International Union shall encourage and stimulate our locals to engage in co-operative enterprise I feel sure that the members will thereby be brought into closer touch with the union. -In the preceding two articles I endeavored to prove that our present system of big locals has radical defects and that if we want to remedy the defects our big locals must be reconstructed to consist of not more than 500 members. -The unity of our big locals is maintained by artificial means. Now, the membership of every local is held together through the local office where their names are registered. They are assumed to be united through their local officers, whose duty it is to visit the factories and \"control the shops.\" Theoretically they are held together by their executive board and, in a sense, by the Joint Board. \" -But are they united one member with another in thought and feeling? Does every one of the 10,000 members of a certain local realize that he is affiliated with a group of congenial people who are allied in a bond of fellowship, friendship and brotherhood? Do we sometimes hear our cloakmakers, skirtmakers, waistmakers; dressmakers, and so forth, refer to the imion in private conversation in such fond terms as associated workers in past years spoke of their small society or club? Our locals have not and cannot have such a powerful attraction as the group or social circle in years past, simply because the group and the circle were small in number. There, all were personally acquainted; close friendship prevailed, while in our locals this is physically impossible. -In some of our locals the impersonality has reached so far that the members are spared even the only duty that had formerly brought them together face to face with their local officers and the union headquarters. I mean the sacred duty of paying their dues. In some of our big locals the entire burden of this duty has been thrown on the shoulders of our true and devoted shop chairmen or \"chair -ladies.\" Thus paying dues has been turned into collecting dues. In such locals it is the duty of the shop chairmen to collect the dues and bring them to the office of the union, otherwise most of these dues might not be paid. And in thousands of cases the members do not know what really the Union means — ^the chairman or chairlady is to them all that the union stands for. -In such locals the shop chairmen are the real union men and women; and it has been often stated quite correctly that the shop chairmen are the supporting coltmins on which the entire foundation of our union rests. • -Of course the shop chairmen and chairladies render great and valuable services. We cannot speak too highly of their disinterested work as the spokesmen and representatives of the workers in the shops. But when the organization reaches a stage where the shop stewards are of paramount importance, while the masses of workers are hardly of any account except as dues payers, which often does mean that No Chairman, No Union, it is time to take stock of the situation. -In smaller locals, which feel and bear the entire responsibility for the existence and success of their local union, a much better system can be developed. In smaller locals there is no need to throw the burden of collecting dues upon the shoulders of the shop stewards. For, at best, this system is fraught with confusion and irregularity. Quite often the collections get so mixed up that it is impossible to tell whether it was \"Bessie,\" or \"Gussie\" that paid them. Smaller locals can render their weekly meetings so interesting and attractive that members will look forward to them eagerly and pay their dues gladly, conscious of performing a great, sacred duty, involving their benefit and protection. -In some of our big locals where the members take their dues personally to the office of the union they have to wait in long lines. Under this system the personality of the member is completely overshadowed by the amount of money he has to pay or the number of dues stamps to which he is entitled. This is a cold, mechanical, soulless arrangement, in which the human being does not count at all. Present Tr3ring S3r8tem of Dues Collection -Smaller locals can dispense with such an impersonal and unfeeling system. In a small local there is nothing to prevent the introduction of a monthly system of dues, which would save the secretary hours of writing and adding up figures ; which would eliminate the frequent disputes with certain members who hotly claim that their payments were not entered, while the secretary, searching the records, cannot conceal his annoyance. In smaller locals it is possible to make the members feel such an absorbing interest in the union as will move them to ♦ save the time and labor of the secretary and other officials. There is no reason why such groups, joined in real fellowship, should not agree to lighten the officers\\' burdens and eliminate a tangled and confused system which is trying to the nerves and creating annoyance and bad blood. -True, some men and women are miserly and reluctant to part with their cash. Such members must be forced to pay their dues. But in a small local, where the personal feeling predominates, such members would feel the moral pressure of the local public opinion. They would soon find that to be backward means to cut a sorry figure, and no one, however miserly, will care to be known as an odious exception. -But how are the smaller locals to be organized and constituted? Will the locals maintain harmony among them.selves? Will not every local seek to foster separate interests, in the way of a separate office, a separate scale of wages and a separate policy? Will this change mean a revolution in the organization? Will the functions and duties of the locals, their executive boards and -joint boards have to undergo a radical change ? Will it be necessary to change the laws of the constitution in regard to local autonomy, local management, shop strikes, local finances and local enterprise ? -There is one answer to all these questions. The reconstitution of the locals certainly means a change, but — for the better, for the good and welfare of every local. The duties and fimctions of the locals, the executive boards and joint boards would remain the same: namely, to improve conditions and strengthen the union. There is no need to change the present form of local autonomj;. Every local should be free in strictly local matters, yet closely allied with the rest of the locals in the same branch of trade through a joint board, in all matters affecting the general interest. So far as the policy of the union, minimum scale of wages, maximum number of working hours, general strikes and other questions pertaining to the entire industry are concerned — these matters should remain, as at present, in the hands of the joint boards and the International Union. New York— a Knotty Problem -The most difficult part of the problem will naturally confront us in New York. In referring to joint boards, the New York Joint Board of the Cloak and Skirtmakers at once occurs to the mind. This Joint Board is now, too, a large organization. At present it consists of ten locals and every local is represented by five delegates. Under a plan of smaller locals it would consist of about 100 locals, each local represented by one dele-, gate. Notwithstanding an increased number of delegates, its work would still be conducted on the same principle as at present. The main thing is that the locals shall be properly constituted ; then its problems will be less grave and complicated. If the bricks and mortar and girders and other material of a structure are of the best kind, and jerry-building is guarded against, the building must naturally be strong and solid. Let the locals consist of true and devoted members, permeated with the spirit of genuine labor solidarity, and the joint board would reflect this condition. Then its task will be performed with less anxiety and worry than at present. -The change would be felt mostly in the government of the local. Take, for example, Local No. 25. Today its executive board is composed of thirty members, besides officers. Thus the government over its 25,000 members is in the hands of some fifty persons. From time to time this government consults with the 600 or so shop stewards. From time to time a branch meeting is called and is attended by the fifty board members and office holders, a certain number of shop stewards and a small number of interested members, especially those who are by nature disposed to be critical of and questioning the policy of the \"government.\" In Local No. 25 it is understood that if the mass of the membership could only thoroughly realize three essentials—regular payment of dues; lodging complaints for cause and joining in strikes whenever called — it would be an ideal membership. At present only ten or fifteen per cent, of the membership record their votes at the local elections. -But under the new plan there would be fifty locals in the waist and dress trade of New York, each local haying a chairman, vice-chairman, financial secretary, recording secretary, three trustees, two auditors, an inner guard and an executive board of nine members. Thus the government of every local would consist of nineteen members. Then there would be a joint board of all the locals in the trade and a number of business agents. -So that, instead of the fifty members now governing Local No. 25, the government over the 25,000 organized waist and dressmakers would be in the hands of about 1,000 members for a period of six months. In a small organization a semiannual election is an easy and simple matter and need not be attended by noisy agitation, confusion or disorder of any kind. Thus the organized waist and dressmakers would enjoy a larger measure of genuine democracy, their local life would be more sociable and every member would be more interested in her local ; yet the waist and dress trade would by no means be scattered into fifty fractions. Through its joint board attending to all complaints, trade disputes, shop — tters and strikes, its membership -It is self-evident that a presser, for example, would be ineligible as a member of an operator\\'s local or a finisher of a presser\\'s local. In this connection no change is needed in the constitution. If a presser should be compelled by circumstances to transfer his membership from one presser\\'s local to another, he should without difficulty be released from the one and admitted into the other. Clearance or transfer cards should only apply where a member goes from one city to another, or when a skirtmaker takes work at waists and dresses, or when a ladies\\' tailor goes to work in a cloak shop, and in similar cases. -There need be no change in the present shop organization and system of shop meetings, and if, as it is to be hoped, week work and a minimum wage is going to be introduced in the near future, the system of small locals would make for a bond of unity between them. There is no reason why there should be any desire for separateness. As regards the trade, wages, hours of labor and organizing work throughout the country, there is every reason for closer unity and greater solidarity than at the present time. The metnbership would then feel as members of a great international imion and not as members of a big local, which, imder certain circumstances, might feel tempted to defy the will of the entire organization. -In the next article we shall consider certain objections against the proposition of smaller locals. AH the objections are based on the fear of someone losing personal influence. One very important result of this reorganization is bound to be an increase in the number and personnel of the local government. Today a small number of officers have considerable power. In smaller locals a larger number of members would share in tfiis power. We have touched the very spot where, genuine democracy in our locals is a signal failure. A union fotmded on democratic principles should have leaders and executives. But when the bulk of the membership holds aloof from the executive control the leaders tend to become autocrats. -A group of members of the Wrapper and House Dressmakers* Union, Local No. 41, assembled in the office of their union on a Saturday evening and celebrated the first anniversary of the existence of their Educational Club. -It was a very impressive scene to view the group of young women and young men, members of the club, sitting around a table covered with a white cloth on which was a varied assortment of food. One could not escape noticing the shining faces of the assembled, their eyes directed with pride to a case in the library containing hundreds of good books. -T^rom this library the entire membershi\\'-* can draw books and keep them for two weeks free of charge. In addition to this the members of the club assemble once a week and spend the evening for self -culture. The two hours are spent either in discussing social, economic, industrial or political questions from different points of view, or one of the members reads a chapter from a book, such as Spencer\\'s \"Education,\" and afterwards it is discussed by the members. -What strikes one most is that the activities of this Educational Club are not directed from above. The club is not only organized, but also managed by these young women and young men. Needless to say that such kind of activities develop the workers mentally and broaden their views. They strengthen their character, develop initiative and ultimately inspire them for further activities in the interest of the labor movement. -While watching the happy faces of the members* of the Educational Club of Local 41, the whole historv of this local since 1909 came to my mind — how a group of girls working on wrappers somewhere m a basement in Brownsville assembled in a room and began to discuss conditions of this trade. The earnings were going down, the treatment by their employers was beyond endurance, -and an idea came to their mind that it would be a mighty good thing to\\' organize the workers into a union, which once or several times had existed before. -The girls, inspired with the idea, began a campaign. In August, 1910, during the historic Cloakmakers\\' strike, they issued a leaflet calling the wrappermakers out on general strike, and w^ere successful in getting out the workers of Brownsville and Williamsburg. I remember how in the midst of the strike, the then General Secretary-Treasurer of the International Union ordered the executive board of the local to send a committee to answer charges for calling a general strike without the knowledge of the International officers, especially while the Cloakmakers\\' strike was in progress. The committee succeeded in convincing the general officers that the strike was confined to \\'the contractors of Brownsville and Williamsburg only. We carried on the strike single handed and won. The victory, of course, meant only the beginning of the formation of the present organization. -The first victory brought the wrappermakers an increase in their earnings from 15 to 20 per cent, and a reduction in the working hours from sixty or more to fiftyfour and in many instances the • abolition of fines and paying for thread and needles. -But a real strong union was not organized till February 12, 1913. After a six weeks\\' strike of all the workers of the trade in Greater New York, the manufacturers\\' association, formed during the strike, was compelled to sign an agreement with the union, which provided for a grievance board, composed of an equal number of manufacturers and employees, and in case of disagreement every case was subject to review by a board of arbitration. This was considered a great victory because the manufacturers who formed the association had never recognized a union in the trade -and had bitterly opposed any movement among their workers for organization. The important gains were the shortening of the hours to»fifty; increasing the earnings from 10 to 20 per cent., and placing upon the association the responsibility for their contractors. Until then the wrappermakers employed by the contractors had never been certain of their pay, and it had often happened that such employers had disappeared with two or three weeks\\' wages. -The International Union then conducted strikes in several industries employing mostly girl workers, and the wrappermakers were the first to be called out. Soon they were followed by the waistmakers of Local No. 25, white goods workers of Local No. 62, and children\\'s dressmakers of Local No. 50. The uprising of these girls called public attention to their appalling conditions and interested such persons as ex-President Roosevelt and others. People learned that in this tfade there still existed the fine system, and in many cases the workers had to pay for needles. -Since then wrappers have given place to house dresses. The new garment, the house dress, began in a short time to dominate the market, and simultaneously the wrapper workers also changed. The men more and more deserted the trade and the women workers had a chance to become more skilled. This change in the trade and the fact that the higher class of house dress resembles a dress, brought new manufacturers and contractors into the field. -The result of all this was that the workers in this trade underwent another general strike in February, 1916. President Schlesinger of the International suceeded in bringing the employers to arbitration through the then Council of Conciliation of which Dr. Felix Adler was chairman. As the result of that arbitration the house dressmakers won a working week of forty-nine hours and a substantial increase. The agreement also provided for a board of arbitration and made the manufacturers responsible for the contractors. -This year Local No. 41 has secured another increase in wages, but this was due to their success in building up a -strong union that is. now feared and respected. Before the agreement expired, March, 1918, the employers realizing that the local was in good condition and that the members had learned the value of organization and therefore would be ready to stand by the union till the last, they were wise enough to avoid a fight by agreeing to give the workers a $2.00 increase. They also agreed to register the contractors with the union. This gives the union a chance to enforce union conditions in the outside shops. A compromise was reached in regard to the demand for a forty-eight hour week to the effect that the decision of the Arbitration Board in the waist and dressmakers\\' industry shall be followed. -This is a very brief review of the striuggles and gains of a group of workers employed in a trade that was formerly the most exploited. I remember the time when the ^yrappermakers were ashamed of their trade. It is natural that workers employed under such conditions as the wrappermakers before 1910, should not boast of their occupation -There is one very important thing that the members of Local No. 41 must do that will tend to make the union strong and its position safe, and this is, to create a defence fund. For this an educational campaign should be started at once among the active members of the organization, to enlighten the members on the necessity for such a fund. -The older members of the organization, men and women, who have devoted the best years of their life to building up this local and who loyally took care of it in the first years of its existence, who many a time gave away their last few dollars that made it possible to keep up the office — I feel that the best compensation for these members is the success of the local. The history and struggles of this local will serve as an inspiration for the younger members of the union. -If these old members could have seen the bright faces at the banquet table they would have been amply rewarded. All this is the fruit of tireless work since 1910. -One cannot but feel delighted with the standing of these workers in the progressive labor movement. -LABOR STANDARDS AS PRESCRIBED. BY THE GOVERNMENT Millions of workers are now engaged on all sorts of work for the government, and it is interesting to know how the government desires that the workers shall be treated. A correct idea of this may be -gathered from a perusal of General Order fo. 13, issued by the Chief of Ordnance for arsenal commanders and manufacturers. The order has been hailed in labor circles as the most enlightened ever issued by a government in time of war. Briefly it is to this effect: -The order is prefaced by the statement that \"vigilance is demanded of all those associated with industry, lest the safeguards with which the people of this country have sought to protect labor should be un¥dscly and unnecessarily broken down. . . . These safeguards arc the mechanisms of efficiency. -Industrial history proves that reasonable hours, fair working conditions, and a proper wage scale are essential to high production,\" and the conditions ordered are, in substance, as follows: -DMily Hours — The day\\'s work should not exceed the customary hours in the particular establishment or the standard already attained in the industry and in the community. It should certainly not be longer than ten hours for an adult workman. -Overtime — ^Thc theory under which we pay \\'^time and a half** for overtime is a tadt recognition that it is usually unnecessary and always undesirable to have overtime. The excess payment is a penalty and intended to act as a deterrent There is no industrial abuse which needs closer watching in times of war. . . . -The working period on Saturday should not exceed five hours. . . . Any additional hours, if essoitial, should be regarded as overtime and paid for on that basis. -Holidays — ^The observance of national and local holidays will give opportunity for rest and relaxation which tend to make production more satisfactory. -Protection Against Hazards and Provisions for Comfort and Sanitation — Existing legal standards to prevent danger from fire, accident, occupational diseases, or other, hazards, and to provide good light, adequate ventilation, sufficient heat, and proper sanitation, should be observed as minimu m requirements. . . . Toilets should be sanitary and readily accessible Temperature conditions should be as nearly normal as possible. ... If any light is at the level of the worker\\'s eyes, it diould be shaded that its rays will not directiy strike the eyes. -Wage Standards — Standards already established in the industry and in the locality should not be lowered. The minimum wage rates should be made in proper relation to the cost of living, and in fixing tiiem it should be taken into consideration that tiie prices of necessities of life have shown great increases. . . . -Prohibition of Night IForic— The emplojrment of women on night shifts should be prevented as a necessary protection, morally and physically. -Rest Periods — ^No woman should be employed for a longer period tiian four and a half hours without a break for a meal, and a recess of ten minutes should be allowed in the middle of each working period. -Tiioe for Meals — ^At least thirty minutes should be allowed for a meal and this time should be lengthened to forty-five minutes or an hour if tiie working day exceeds eight hours. Meals should not be eaten in the workroom. -Saturday Half-Holiday^The Saturday half-holiday should be considered an absolute essential for women under all conditions. -Seats — For women who sit at their work, seats with backs should be provided unless the occupation renders tiiis impossible. For women who stand at work, seats should be available and tiieir use permitted at regular intervals. -Lifting Weights — ^No woman should be required to Uft repeatedly more than twenty-five pounds in any smi^e load. -Replacement of Men by Women — ^When it is necessary to employ women in work hitherto done by men, care ^(honld He taken -to make sure that the task is adapted to the strength of women. The standards of wages hitherto prevailing for men in the process should not be lowered where women render equivalent service. The hours for women engaged in such processes, of course, should not be longer than those formerly worked by men. -Tenejneiit House Work — No work shall be given out to be done in rooms used for living purposes or in rooms directly connected with living rooms in any dwelling or tenement. -It is interesting • to hear that Secretary McAdoo, Director General of the railroads, has appointed W. S. Carter, president of tiie Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Bnginemen, as Director of Labor in the new railroad administration. In well informed circles it is believed that this appointment is a real step in the direction of democratic control over the industries over which the government is extending its control. -Mr. Carter has no executive power, but he has charge of all railroad labor questions, acting in an advisory capacity to Mr. McAdoo. But his appointment is considered a gain for all the organized workers, including the unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor. Under the old railroad administration the managers were hostile to the unions and their organizing work, and bitter strikes occurred froib time to time. Now, the Federation unions have reached an understanding with Secretary McAdoo, agreeing to suspend for the time of the war certain union rules as to overtime and apprentices or non-union workers. In return for this they will have every opportunity to bring the unorganized into line. -The Railroad Wage Commission, appointed some time ago, has just presented its report. It recommends an increase in wages to some two million railroad workers amounting in the aggregate to $3,500,000. -The railroad unions now have a splendid opportunity to place their organizations on a strong foundation both as regards numbers and reasonable control over their conditions of labor. -When a person commits a crime he must pay the penalty of the law. If, however, his enemies have framed him up and the perjury of bought witnesses is clearly proven — ^what then? -Tom Moone/s trial in San Francisco was such a frame-up. The perjury of the witnesses was so clearly on the surface that Judge Griffin refused to pronounce sentence, even though the jury found Mooney guilty, of course, on the perjured evidence. -It is a disgraceful scandal and a slur on the public opinion of that city and state, all the more so because Mooney is admitted to be the victim of a conspiracy. So are his colleagues, W. K. Billings, Israel Wein\\'berg and Mrs. Mooney. Edward Nolan, one of the group, was acquitted. -Mr. Bourke Cockran, the principal counsel for the Mooney^ defense, speaking at a meeting in New York last month, said: -\"What is proposed, is the execution of an innocent man — not through mistake resting upon doubtful testimonv, but in the light of clear admissions by competent authority that the testimony on which he was convicted is perjury and the result of a conspiracy. The execution of a man under these conditions would be a calamity graver than if at this moment shot and shell were rained from the enemy\\'s ships on this and every other city of the Atlantic seaboard. -\"I say to you, and I think I speak the language of moderation, that, while there have been miscarriages of justice under every political system, while there have been perversions of justice, while innocent men have been condemned not merely through mistake, but through conspiracy, nevertheless I state deliberate^ that this conviction of Thomas Mooney is the most glaring perversion of justice in the whole history of jurisprudence in America or in England or in any other country in the world. -\"Every other execution or conviction has been attended at least by circumstances which justified the pretense that the Judges were executing the law. Here the constituted authorities themselves a^ree in declaring that a conviction involvmg the life of a human being has been brought about by perjury, and the Supreme Court of the State declares that it can only examine the record of what occurred at the trial; that it has no power to consider subsequent disclosures, which show that that record is a record of perjury and crime. -the people, announce themselves powerless to meet and overthrow a conspiracy between a few wretches of the underworld and some leaders, so-called, of the upper world. -\"Judge Griffin is a courageous and a bold jurist,\" said Mr. Cockran. \"I believe that he has the power to prevent this infamous wrong from being accomplished. He has the power to prevent the murder of an innocent man by perjury which he recognises to have been committed in his courtroom. He has control over the record of this trial, and he may, in my opinion, purify it of the perjury, which he knows to be the only testimony against Mooney. Judge Grimn has indicated that he has some doubt as to this power, but I believe that his investigatioa will convince him that he possesses it and that he will grant the motion when it is made.\" -Stephens of California granting a pardon. In this connection it is interesting to note that Mooney himself demands justicenew trial — rather than a pardon. -Seattle, Wash. — Last month two international unions held a joint convention at the Seattle Labor Temple and brought about an amalgamation. They were the International Shingle Weavers and the International Timber Workers, and the united organization will be known as the International Union of Timber Workers. -Last fall these workers in the lumber camps and mills lost a strike for the eight hour day and this has stimulated an agitation for the amalgamation just brought about -In the program adopted at the convention the new organization pledges support to the national government in this time of stress. It urges acceptance by the employers of the principle of collective bargaining. It insists that wages should be commensurate with the increasing cost of living. It declares its belief in the principle of the eight hour day. It refuses to surrender the right to quit work to enforce legitimate demands, though believing that the strike should be a last resort, after all other means of securing justice have been exhausted. It declares its rigid adherence to all agreements governing industrial conditions and declares its afifiliation with the American Federation of -Labor. -In all thoughtful labor circles, in America, as well as in Europe, there was much surprise and disappointment at the fact that President Samuel Gompers of the American Federation of Labor had, in the name of the American labor movement, isolated our movement from the advanced labor movement of Europe. Recently a conference of Socialist and labor representatives of the Allied countries was held in London. Every allied country was represented at the conference. The American labor movement, however, had made itself conspicuous by its absence. -President Gompers has advanced the explanation that he had received tiie invitation too late. Here follows a statement from the \"Jewish Times,\" published in London. Referring to the conference, the \"Jewish Daily Times says: -A contributory factor, in the pessimistic atmosphere was the letter of Mr. Gompers, stating in tiie name of the American workers that they would not be represented at the conference because now was not the time to t£dk of peace. The pro-war press added that Mr. Gompers had written to say that the conference was under German influence. The friends of the conference felt that this was a blow given in the back, and it was doubted whether the conference would recover from the blow. -Thus the conference had to work under very unfavorable conditions. But to our jov it surmounted all difficulties. Gradually all the delegates assembled in the conference hall and immediately repudiated the assertions made in the name of Mr. Gompers. Vandervelde of Belgium very aptly pointed out in a splendid speech delivered at the conference that one should not onljp take into account the acts of the Bolshe^^ki,. who had discredited International Socialism^ but one should also take into account the great thing achieved by the Russian revoluti()n for Internationalism and Socialism at its grandiose beginning. . . . Faith, confidence and hope in £e conference continued to mount, and the conclusion was grandiose. A peace program was issued in the name of the Socialists and working classes of all Allied countries, and the program is one that may really serve as a basis for a general democratic peace. -The well-known memorandum of the British Labor Party served as a basis for working out the general democratic peace program, and nearly all the points of diat memorandum were adopted. Only in several instances slight changes were made. -At a meeting of Director General of Railroads McAdoo\\'s wage commission. Miss Pauline Goldmark, sister-in-law of United States Supreme Court Justice Brandeis, gave figures to show that women are being employed in increasing lumbers to do heavy railroad work. -\"One railroad employs 400 on one division and another has a total of 1,517 women workers,\" she said. -Miss Goldmark declared women were lifting weights of as much as fifty pounds as drill press operators. -She told of investigating conditions at a factory in Zanesville, O., where many women are employed. -\"The majority of women at this point,\" she said, \"are engaged at hard labor, such as loading scrap iron, sorting scrap iron, wheeling iron castings in wheelbarrow, etc. The women are loading scrap and sorting work out in the yards, with no protection from the intense nys of the sun or from the weather. These women wear over-alls and large-brim hats. They hand the iron up from the ground to others in the cars, who pile it. The hours are nine a day and fifty-four a week, with one-half hour for lunch. Wages are twenty cents an hour and $1.50 is deducted each montii for relief purposes. Men are paid twenty-one cents an hour for the same kind of work.\" -The feminine war helper, who dons a nobby uniform to drive a motor truck, was frowned upon by the National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teachers\\' Association in annual convention in Atlantic City.. A report on this subject said: -\"The preparing of women to be automobile drivers, truck chauffeurs and for other masculine lines of work, is not half so important as preparing for wholesome, economic home making and wise and loving child training.\" The conmiittee declared its position on this question is not a hobby, and asked: -The campaign for the third Liberty Loan will be opened on the 6th day of April, 1918, the first anniversary of the declaration of a state of war between the United States and Germany. -The amount, terms and conditions of the loan have not yet been decided because these features are dependent upon further legislation. I expect to ask Congress at an early date to grant the necessary additional authority. -Of course, the opening date of the campaign is somewhat dependent upon the new legislation, but it is hoped and believed that the matter can be considered and determined in ample time to begin the campaign on the date suggested. April 6 will forever be a consecrated day in American history and it seems peculiarly apropriate that the opening the second year of our participation in this war shpuld be celebrated with a nation-wide drive for another Liberty Loan. The campaign should begin with great demonstrations of patriotism in every city, town and hamlet in the coimtry that will truly express the spirit of aroused America. On this date every American should pledge anew to his government the full measure of his resources and resolve to make every required sacrifice in the same fervent spirit that impels our gallant sons in the trenches of France and on the waters of the Atlantic to shed their blood in America\\'s sacred cause.. To carry forward America\\'s essential part in this war for righteousness and justice every man and woman in the country must lend their available means to the government, and I know of no more fitting beginning of the second year of the war. -The campaign, in all probability, will last three or four weeks and announcement of the opening date is made at this time in accordance with my promise to make pub-lie all matters connected with the loan as soon as determined, in order that ample time may be given every community to prepare for the event. I earnestly hope that parades and patriotic meetings will be held in all parts of the country. The treasury department will endeavor to make the observance of the anniversary of the declaration of war as memorable as was the patri•otic observance during the second Liberty Loan campaign of Liberty Day on the 24th of October, 1917. -ENGLAND AND AMERICA For their respective first three months the American War-Savings Campaigti is running ahead of the English campaign. America is pouring into the Treasury at the rate of about $2,000,000 a day— over $75,000,000 up to date. -The $75,944,417 of spending already put at the service of the Government by the buyers of War-Savings Securities has transferred from millions of patriotic, saving citizens to the National Treasury command of the labor and materials to build a fleet of about one hundred 5,000-ton ships. -YORK REVERSES ITS POLICY V At its meeting held March 12 the United Hebrew Trades approved the reconunendation of its executive board, to authorize its secretary. Max Pine, to co-operate with the Federal Liberty Bond Committee in the campaign for the third issue of Liberty bonds. -This is practically a reversal of its previous pacifist policy. Recent events in Russia and the sympathetic utterances of President Wilson are largely responsible for this change of heart. All freedom-loving people feel that they must range themselves on the side of the nations who are fighting for democracy and against autocracy. -The greater you are, the greater the penalty of your progress. The farther you go, the wider your range, the more you increase the points of contact with which you must reckon, and therefore you multiply your battles against misconception and slander and envy and malice. -You can\\'t avoid or evade your allotted destiny — you can only hold down your share of troubles by holding back. -In every sphere men gibe and sneer — even the peace of the ditch digger is threatened by the unemployed laborer who covets hia job. -■oo long as you aspire, others will conspire — so long as you try, others will vie. ^ You\\'ll have hostility to face at every place and at every pace. -So long as your conscience isn\\'t ashamed to acknowledge you as a friend, don\\'t you give a rap for your enemies. — ^Ex. -There are approximately 1,266,061 women in the United States engaged in industrial work which is either directly or indirectly necessary to carry on the war, according to an estimate based on surveys made in fifteen states for the National League of Women\\'s Service by Miss Marie L. Obenauer, with the sanction and assistance of the Department of Labor. There were approximately 3,500 women engaged in munition factories in 1910; the number is now 100,000, according to Miss Obenauer, who states that this is a conservative estimate. She includes aeroplanes when speaking of munition factories. Most of the women, it is stated, are engaged in weaving:, sewing and preserving foocj, -(In this department^ which is a regular feature of this journal every month, local life and movement is being reported for the information of our members and readers,) -\"The cloak trade in New York is extremely busy. In fact, we are having an exceptional season and all the cloakmakers say that we have not had a spring season like this in many years, and that it exceeds by far the past fall season. Many people ask what the cause for this swing of business from the fall season to the spring, which has been manifest for the last several years, means. In explanation the following facts are offered: There seems to be little di^ercnce during the last few years between the quality and weight of the spring and fall clothes in general. As a matter of fact, you will find that manufacturers even use fur trimmings on spring clothes, and women\\'s garments and styles conform even less to seasonal changes than men\\'s clothes. In other words, the light weight garment is getting into the market very strongly as a selling commodity and is taking the place of the heavy winter garment. Again, during the last few years the use of furs has become very prevalent. Of course, the rich use the real, genuine furs and the poor use the imitation astrachan garments which are usually made in the fur shops. This, to some extent, affects the fall season in the cloak trade. But for spring and summer women use nothing but light cloaks and suits, and the demand for these is much greater than for the winter cloak, which accounts for the expansion of the spring trade. -\"As regards our organization, I can say that it is really in a blooming condition. We already have over eight thousand members in good standing, and as there are altogether not more than ninety-five hundred or ten thousand cloak operators in New York City, of whom about 1,000 are still working on military garments and a -numbier were transferred to Local No. 17, you can judge for yourself that we control 100 per cent, of the operators in the cloak shops in New York. -\"Dues paying is going on on an unprecedented scale. Early in March, by a decision of our Executive Board, dues were raised to 25 cents a week, and time was given for the membership to pay up arrears until the last week in March. That partly explains the tremendous rush at the dues windows of our local. This raise in dues met with very few objections among the rank and file of our union. First of all, all the other locals of the International already raised their dues a considerable time ago, among them\\' also Local No. 17, and it is daily becoming clearer to our members that a local union which has as many obligations to fulfill as our organiation, can not exist on a 16 cents per week rate. In addition to that, the very fact that the price of all commoditieshas been going up for the last few years has reconciled our membership to the necessity of raising the dues. -\"The referendum vote on week work is going on briskly in all the Joint Board offices. It must be explained that only piece workers are participating in this referendum, so a clear show of opinion from these men is wanted On this question. The prevalent opinion, as far as we have been able to ascertain, is for week work, in spite of . the good season in the trade. The only argument that is being advanced against week work is the fear that it may lower the earnings. On the other hand, it is argued that only a small fraction of operators make big wages in a good season, and even these are often paid in advance for work that they finish up after the season on the cut-off tickets. This is true particularly of finishers. -Even if some of them should, as is maintained, earn less, they want no more bartering and bargaining for each and every garment, a system which causes loss \\'of time and energy, and which creates bitterness and strained relations. Years ago, before the union was established, the employers settled prices on garments in accordance with their own sweet will, and made the workers earn their living by long, drawn-out overtime work. Later, when the union came and the principle of collective bargaining was introduced, the workers began to have a say in the settlement of prices, but this brought with it a system of eternal bartering In price fixing. The third stage must be week work, which will give the workers a more settled and definite way of earning a living in our trade. -\"The handful of discredited disrupters has now lost every vestige of influence on the men ,and is hardly heard from. Like a bad dream, they have passed out of the minds of the operators, and it is sometimes hard to believe that anything like that which took place in the Cloak Operators* Union last year really existed and held sway over the interests of our men. The officers of the Joint Board who have worked hard and faithfully to help bring the big organization movement to a successful conclusion must be given full credit for their work. Today practically all the shops have been reorganized and are well controlled. -Organizer Anna Neary writes: \"We have been busy during the last few weeks in a little town, Cumberland, Md., with organizing work, in which we had the assistance of the local Women\\'s Trade Union League. The Baltimore Dry Goods House, one of the biggest concerns in the City, opened up a cloak shop in that town, and, of course, its prime intention was to beat the union and to operate on a non-union basis. We, however, succeeded in going after and getting the girls (most of the workers in that shop are women), to join the union and we organized them into a local of their own. We received a charter from the International for these cloakmak-ers, and they are now Local No. 38. The shop \\\\s increasing in numbers and we expect to exert good control over it, with the help of the Baltimore Joint Board. -\"In Baltimore proper, the organi2ing work is going on apace. The cutters* local is coming back to life and we have no doubt that Local No. 72 will be a stronger factor in the future than it has been until now. -\\'The Joint Board of Baltimore has taken out a charter from the International and is now a recognized element in the local trade union life.\" -\"Conditions are pretty bright in Boston. There is plenty of work in the shops, and all the cloakmakers in Boston are busy. The news that the members of the International voted for Boston as the Convention City for 1918 brought a lot of enthusiasm into our ranks. The Joint Board organized a special committee on convention arrangements from all the six Boston locals of the International, which committee had its first meeting on Sunday, March 3rd, with General Secretary-Treasurer Baroff and Vice-Presidents Halpern and Wander. All the necessary sub-committees were elected and have already started work. -\"The Boston locals are of the opinion that they can make this assembly of the 250 delegates to the convention the most succussful and most interesting in the history of the International Union. A number of enterprises will be undertaken and put through during these two convention weeks, among which we expect to have a great mass meeting, a banquet, a sightseeing trip and probably a .theatre party. We expect another visit from the Arrangements Committee of the International in the near future, to complete the plans that we have laid. The convention will take place in the big hall of the Musicians\\' Union, and it is expected that the surrounding neighborhood and also the sections where the Boston Jewish workers live will be decorated in honor of this big gathering. It is the ambition of the Arrangements Committee to see that during the week of the 20th of May a welcome flag is displayed from the house of every Jew-ish worker in the city, as a token of the enthusiasm of the working class of Boston for the convention of our International Union. -\"A special meeting of the cloak finishers will take place on Monday, March 18th, at 724 Washington Street. At this meeting the special interests of the finishers in the cloak shops will be taken up for discussion. The meeting will be addressed by Vice-President Halpern, who is the manager of the New York Cloak Finishers\\' Union, Local No. 9.\" -Vice-President Perlstein writes: — \"When we speak of Cleveland, it is about time that we had made up our minds that as long as there will be no official recognition of the union by the local manufacturers, the organization will have no stability. It may come to life at the beginning of each season, but it is sure to fall apart before the season is over. -In order to gain the recognition of the union in Cleveland a general strike is absolutely necessary. Some time ago the local cloakmakers again began to hope for a strike of such a calibre and some preparations in that direction were begun. The uncertain conditions in the trade, however, prevented the International from undertaking such a step at that time, and the more active local men thereupon decided to wait patiently until the next fall season, and to keep the trade meanwhile in a state of expectancy. As the convention is near at hand, the local people are expecting the convention to pass upon this matter definitely, one way or another. -\"To show you how the local manufacturers ignore our union, I will cite just one fact. When, through the efforts of President Schlesinger, Fuel Administrator H. A. Garfield rescinded the Monday closing order so far as it affected the ladies\\' garment factories, the Cleveland manufacturers refused to take advantage of this opportunity simply because it came through the efforts of the International Union. You may imagine how difficult it is to keep up an organization under such opposition and animosity. -\"The Cleveland local is going to call a conference of the Middle Western locals of the International in order to solidify their -opinion for favorable action at the convention for a general strike in Cleveland. In order to get ready for the coming fall season the local people have begun in earnest to organize the shop of Landesman & Hirschheimer, one of the biggest in Cleveland, employing largely Jewish workers; a shop where heretofore the workers, while antagonistic toward the union, were profiting at its expense. They utilized every move of the union to organize them to their own advantage, and they exacted each time some concessions from the employers as a result thereof. Just now a strike has been declared against this shop, and the factory is being picketed. Sooner or later the workers in that shop will come to their senses, and, togther with the other Cleveland cloakmakers, will do something practicable for the general improvement of the local trade.\" -\"The. season in the local cloak trade is not bad, particularly in the larger shops where there is plenty of work, and the workers make decent wages. In the smaller shops things are not quite so good, and in some instances the cloakmakers employed there had to stop for a day or two during the last few weeks, as their employers could not get sufficient goods to fill their orders. -\"The organization in general is in very good condition; the membership is in good standing. They attend the meetings of the local and of their shops unusually well. We have a rule here that members (men) must attend no less than one meeting a month, and members (women) must attend no less than one meeting a month, under penalty of fine. We find that this works well, and the attendance at the meetings is excellent. The locals are getting ready for the next season to begin an organization campaign in the few shops that were not organized during the general strike. -\"We have also been busy here collecting money for the War Sufferers. We worked the entire day on Saturday, the 23rd of February, and devoted the earnings of that afternoon to the war sufferer.*?. The success of this undertaking, was unusual, as it was carried out faithfully even in those -shops where there was little work and where the workers could not very well afford to contribute. Indeed, the spirit of fraternity of the local cloakmakcrs in this instance proved quite admirable. The girls of the shop of Bishof, Stern & Stein have done particularly well in this respect, and their action deserves mention. The firm of Bishof, Stern & Stein likewise contributed, as the list that I am submitting herewith shows: -\"After all, the old saying \\'Where there is life there is hope,* is true. We have had in Toledo during February visitors whom we had so long expected. Since the Cleveland Convention we have been speaking of a meeting of the General Executive Board in Toledo* and it took almost four years to materialize. -receive the General Executive Board of our International, and I believe that we were quite successful in our aim to make things pleasant for them. On Sunday, the 10th of February, we celebrated the eighth anniversary of Local No. 67, and our speakers were President Schlesingef, SecretaryTreasurer BarofF and a number of vicepresidents. As was to be expected, the prestige of the union has materially increased since that time, and now our organization consists of fully 100 per cent, of the local cloakmakers and pressers, in good standing. People who had long standing grievances against the union for years, came back to the organization and we met them with open arms. -*We have no written agreements with the employers, and our relations with them resemble the ancient tactics which the Israelites pursued in their war with Amalek. When Moses held his hands up high, the Israelites prevailed over Amalek, and when Moses let his hands drop, Amalek prevailed. Our members have become convinced that as long as they will keep watch for unity in their ranks and will come regularly to the meetings of their organization, they will have the upper hand, and that no agreement will help them if they stay away from the union. -\"President Schlesinger had a conference with one of the chiefs of the firm of Cohen, Friedlander & Martin, Mr. Goldman, who is president of the Western Cloak Manufacturers\\' Association. Mr. Goldman complained to our president that we were not reasonable and that we demanded too high prices, and in consequence the firm will be compelled to move from Toledo. -\"As Brother Friend, president of Local No. 67 and the shop chairman of that shop, was present at the conference, he reported to us that President Schlesinger had defended our position in a masterful way. -\"During the week of February 23rd, we had some trouble in one of our shops, the Conde Cloak Company, which involved a re-settlement of prices on some work. After the operators had worked a few weeks on certain garments they began to complain that they could not make a living. They came to the Executive Board and requested us to help them resettle prices on some garments. This demand was granted, and a committee was sent to the firm on that matter. The firm refused to listen to -the committee, and as a result, a stoppage was ordered in the shop. After striking for three days, a committee consisting of Brothers Friend, Fishier and myself, resettled the prices on the work, and raises ranging from 10 per cent, to 50 per cent, on a garment were granted, to the complete satisfaction of the workers in the shop. -\"Just recently we taxed ourselves, according to the ability of each man and woman, for the Jewish war sufferers, and we sent a check for $214.75 to the International Union. While this may seem a very small sum, it must be taken into consideration that Washington\\'s Birthday is not a legal holiday in Toledo, and the money \\' was contributed from our own pockets. Besides, our season is already at an end here. -\"In closing I want to say that there are still certain improvements lacking in our local. Our members still pay 15 cents dues, and the more active members in our organization are starting a movement for higher dues in order to cover the immediate necessities of the organization. It is to be hoped that this work will be crowned with good results.\" -Organizer Ben Gilbert writes: — \"Things are quite lively and interesting in the Cloakmakers\\' Union today. Since our last strike in 1913 most of our members have been under the impression that in order to improve the condition of the cloakmakers and to get the employers to recognize the union, only one method is available, — that is, a general strike. At every one of our meetings we talked of nothing but strike, and it really seemed to us that there was no other way out of the situation. When President Schlesinger visited us in January, he showed us how to improve the condition of the cloakmakers and how to gain the recognition of the union without a general strike. We have followed his advice, and today our union is in a better condition than it has ever been since we began organizing in St. Louis. If we go on along the same lines and if nothing untowafrd occurs, the organization of the St. Louis cloakmakers on a 100 per cent, basis is a matter of the very near future. -\"Just recently we got rid of the S. A. S. factory here in St. Louis. It was a subfactory and it gave us plenty of trouble most of the time. Our cloakmakers will surely not regret this fact; it will give them a better opportunity to ask for decent prices in the inside shop of the same firm. -\"We have decided to levy a tax of $2.00 on each member in order to increase our treasury, and we are confident that our members will respond to this tax with a will.\" -\"In my previous reports I have dwelt in particular on two conditions which prevail in our local trade since the last general strike, i.e., the small prices which the workers get for their labor and the long hours of overtime they are compelled to work in order to eke out an existence at the present high cost of living. The cloakmakers in Montreal seem so deeply interested in their work that they overlook the fact that they are the most exploited men and women in the shops of this city. They have not even noticed the striking difference between their earnings of last year, when they had a strong union, and their earnings of this season \\\\^en their organization is not complete. Some of them must have figured that they would rather spend the hour or two at the shop and local meeting than in the factory at overtime to enable them to increase their earnings. -\"Their illusions were, however, rudely dispelled at their last big meeting when President Schlesinger and Vice-Presidents Metz and Koldofsky addressed them and pointed out to them the crime which they were committing against themselves and their own families by staying away from the union. Even during the busy months of the present season they are earning hardly enough to make a living, let alone saving for the slack time that is to come. -\"On Tuesday evening, the 5th of March, we had a meeting of delegates from all the shops. Vice-Presidents Metz and Koldofsky listened to the shop reports, and, almost without exception, the conditions reported were uniformly bad: 75 hours of -\"A mass meetuig of all the workers was held on Wednesday, March 6, and the attendance exceeded all our expectations; Prince Arthur Hall was crowded, and the cloakmakers who came to the meeting were very anxious to hear what our general officers had to tell them. The speeches\\' that President Schlesinger, Vice-President Metz and Koldofsky, and also Brother Alex \\' Cohen who was in Montreal just then and spoke at the meeting, were received with enthusiasm. My impression is that the effect of the speeches went much further than the mere applause, and that our people are beginning to realize that they have learned that it is bad policy to leave matters to the good faith of the employers, and that their only defence is a strong organization. -\"We are calling many shops to meetings every evening now and the response is much better than ever before. Shop questions are being discussed with interest and eagerness, and it is to be hoped that after another one or two of such instructive mass meetings we may have in Montreal for the next season a strong union which will be in a position to give the workers better working conditions than they have had during this past season. -\"The biggest occurrence of the last month in the life of the cloakmakers of Toronto was the decision to raise the dues of the members to 30 cents for those who belong to the Sick Benefit Fund, and to 20 cents for the other members. This decision was adopted by an overwhelming majority at a membership meeting on March 17. The question was discussed from every angle. It was shown that the bigger and smaller strikes frequent in the cloak trade entail a large expense and that the 15 cents paid until\\' now were absolutely insufficient to cover the normal expense of the union. Of course, our locals have been used in the past to appeal to the International whenever they were m need of assistance, but it is becoming apparent that it is not the right method to pursue and that we must henceforth rely upon our own financial resources in our struggles. A -union must always have a fair sized treasury to enable it to look into the future without fear of financial stress and embarrassment. This is particularly true of the Cloakmakers\\' Union where friction with unscrupulous employers is frequent. We are compelled to bargain with our bosses daily on the prices of the work, and we must be ready to assist our members to fight for their existence. -\"Otherwise the Cloakmakers* Union of this city is running along in a perfectly normal way. The majority of the shops are unionized and the workers are loyal and devoted. At our last general meeting it was decided to raise a special fund to organize the workers of Eaton\\'s shop, and the proposition is meeting with favor. -\"There is enough\\' work in the shops; dues are being paid regularly, and new members are coming in daily. Our union here has accomplished a number of improvements for the workers — chiefly, higher earnings. Of course, we did not get this without conflicts at price settlement. -\"The pressers have likewise, in a quiet but systematic way, improved prices for work in the shops. The skirt and dress makers have had more trouble and more earnest fights with some employers. They have, however, gained a considerable increase in weekly earnings for all the workers. In some cloak shops prices are being re-settled even now. This re-settlement of prices, while »t is a test of strength between the workers and the employers in which the workers are the victors because of the season, is, in the long run, a lesson for those manufacturers who wanted to utilize the slack time to force the price committees to accept hunger prices. -\"Of course, things are still far from being perfect, and \\'more unity must prevail in our ranks to secure improvements in the shops. Take, for instance, the question of overtime: It is a matter of common knowledge that long hours are injurious to the health of the worker. However, the employers drag out the settlement of prices for weeks, even though they already have the orders and materials. This is done to increase the difficulties of the workers and get them to make the work cheaper. The members cannot withstand the temptation of overtime and it remains for the union to fight against it until we can abolish it altogether.\" -One of the important achievements of our International Union is the growth and development of a strong White Goods Workers\\' Union, Local\\' No. 62. -Till\\' 1909 there was practically no organization in this trade at all, and not many believed that there ever would be any. \"Why,\" many said, \"how in the world could there be any organization in this trade that would count?\" This kind of reasoning was based on the fact that not only is this a trade where 99 out of every 100 workers are women, but also on the fact that these \"women\" are mostly young girls and many of them of school age. -The skeptics lived long enough to learn that a union in the white goods trade could not only exist, but they also had a chance to watch it grow and realize that after five years* existence, it became a factor not only in our International Union, but withm the progressive labor movement as a whole. -I shall here attempt to review its short, but interesting life. I shall content myself with a bit of its history that dates back as far as 1912, although a charter had been issued to the white goods workers in 1909. -Two years after the charter was issued, when an organizing campaign was started among the white goods workers, there were only a few dozen members within the organization. The first few shops which the union controlled, were the B. Apthaker, the Puritan and Chelsea. The workers of these shops were the pioneers and they were a great factor in organizing the entire trade. This justifies the contention of many that it is worth all the eflForts to get one or two shops organized in a trade for a start. Because this is really the foundation of the future Local Union. -After an intensive organizing campaign had been carried on among the white goods workers, a call for a general strike was issued on February 9, 1913, and those who watched the stream of 8,000 young women pouring from the -factory districts from all over the city into the different meeting halls, and heard their young voices loudly ringing with joy, singing labor songs full of hope and inspiration and cheering the speakers who addressed them, will never forget the scene. -A close observer could have noticed how these young girls from day to day became more and more serious, and how they were transformed into mature women, women who realized how difficult it is to get justice from a society that is built on exploitation. -We remember how the manufacturers of the white goods trade, who are classed among the wealthiest in the Ladies* Garment Industry, refused to meet the representatives of their workers, the same workers who produced for theiti the wealth they enjoy. The employers refused to discuss the demands for a living wage, for the reduction of working hours that were as long as fifty-eight a week, and the abolition of fines. They refused to parley with the representatives of their workers, whose earnings were as high as $2.00 and $3.00 a week and whether it was right and just that these girls should pay for the repair of machines that did not belong to them. They refused to discuss whether it was just that their underpaid workers should pay for straps, needles and in many instances for thread and power. -They refused to hear grievances as to the way these young girls were treated by their foremen. To all these demands of the strikers the manufacturers gave one answer, \"There is nothing to arbitrate !\" After a five weeks\\' bitter strike, during which time hundreds of yovmg striking pickets were beaten up by sluggers, hundreds arrested by police officers and locked up in police cells together with suspicious persons, and many of them, half starved, spent their days either on the picket line or in the meeting halls — after these trying weeks the strikers were just as determined to fight to the bitter end as on the first day of the strike. -When the employers saw this determination they agreed to meet the representatives of the strikers and discuss their demands. As a result of the negotiations, the employers offered to grant some of their demands, but absolutely refused to recognize a union of their workers. The employers could stand the material concessions which they were compelled to grant to their employees, but they would not agree to recognize a shop chairman representing the toilers in their shops. They agreed to part with some of their profits, but they refused to modify their autocratic powder. They refused to recognize a union of their workers that would challenge their absolute power over their employees. -I remember the scene when the leaders of the union submitted to the strikers the offers of the employers to grant many of their demands but the recognition of the union. The leaders, in submitting this proposal to the strikers for decision, tested their determination. I shall never forget the scene that followed after the offer of the employers was read in Cooper Union hall that was packed with strikers. It was a scene that filled the heart of every honest and earnest wprker with joy and pride. -It was a magnificent spectacle to see these young working women, many of whom were seemingly in their teens, formulating an answer to their powerful employers who hoped to starve them into submission. The answer of these young proletarians was \"we shall not return to your workshops until you will recognize our union,\" and with an iron determination they resolved to carry on the fight indefinitely until victory. -After the employers learned that the effect of their refusal to recognize the union served as a stimulus for the strikers to continue the strike with new vigor and enthusiasm, and that they entered on the sixth week of the strike with more determination to win the fight, they realized that such a fight might ruin them, and therefore decided in the middle of the sixth week to meet again the representatives of the strikers. The result of the meeting was that the union was officially recognized by the Cotton Garment Manufacturers\\' Association and the whitegoods workers not only won -material improvements, as the shortening of hours and an increase in their earnings, but also established a minimum wage for learners of $6.00 a week instead of $1.50 or $2.00. But the main thing that they did accomplish was the fact that a union was organized in the trade. -Now, at the fifth anniversary of the existence of the Whitegoods Workers\\' Union, we find this local in very good condition. The local succeeded in establishing the eight hour work day; it fenjoys the respect of every intelligent person and has a standing in the progressive I^bor movement. -Every movement of a progressive and radical character in accordance with the Labor ideals is getting the co-operation and assistance of this local. But I wish to remind the Whitegoods Workers that they have neglected to introduce activities of a co-operative and educational character. We should like to see the White Goods Workc^rs\\' Union initiating such activities that will tend to develop the members, cultivate fellowship ^nd strengthen their character ; activities that would inspire them with zeal for the labor movement. There is among the whitegoods workers plenty of energy that could be utilized, if properly directed, for the benefit of the local. -The White Goods Workers\\' Union, as all our other locals, was confronted with the problem of having all its mem-\\' bers participate in the nomination and election of local officers. Therefore, not being able to induce its members to participate in the formation of its government, they worked out a system by which every shop is represented at nomination. -A conference of all shop chairmen and two workers of each shop is arranged. At the first meeting of the conference, nominations are made for all the officers of the union, including executive members. At the second conference objections are entertained. But in the election the entire membership participates. This system gives all the workers of the shops a chance to be represented. -employers. For a time the employers tried to ignore the union\\'s request. Evidently the approaching of the fifth anniversary of the general strike of the white goods workers in 1913 refreshed the minds of the members of the American Cotton Garment Manufacturers\\' Association, February, 1913, was the month when the white goods workers had deserted their shops. So the employers were wise enough to give one dollar increase to all their workers, although the agreement does not provide for it. -One of the achievements of the White Goods Workers\\' Union is the establishing of the eight hour work day in their trade. The credit of achieving this reform belongs to the officers and leaders of the local union and to the steadfastness and vigorous enthusiasm of a loyal and devoted membership. -White Goods Workers — we expect you at the beginning of the sixth year of your existence to open a new page in the history of your union. -Reductions in wages and widespread unemployment are being predicted as afterthe-war cerUinties by New York bankers and corporation directors. -One reason why Wall Street bankers are urging a campaign for thrift among wageearners is their desire that the workers shall be financially able to endure the wage redactions on which they are counting the moment the ¥^r stops. -To prevent the most disastrous industrial depression in our generation, many farsighted men in the United States and England are insisting that opportunities on the land be opened to the millions of returning soldiers and munition workers who will find themselves out of employment when peace comes. -In Wall Street the coming industrial depression is today being planned for and discussed in the most matter-of-fact way. Says the financial editor of the \"New York Evening Post\": -\\'\\'If workers, by investment in government bonds, do not become used to higher living, it will be less difficult to get them to consent to a reduction in wages when that is made inevitable by peace. What is -more important, the workers will have saved something, which will enable them better to bridge over any interval of unemployment which may come during the period of readjustment.\" -In other words. Wall Street wants the workers to insure themselves out of their present earnings against a bad future. If the wage-earners can be induced to go without \\'luxuries\" (such as meat, eggs, milk, and sugar), during the war, then after the war they may submit to wage reductions, unemployment — anything — without revolting. According to this line of reasoning, every penny saved by the wage-earners during the war will be saved to bankers and emplojring interests after the war. Every dollar the wage-earner can draw from his savings can be subtracted from the amount of his pay-check. -Organized labor knows there is a better way. It is fast coming to a realization that the only hope for the workers is to remove the underlying causes of low wages and unemployment. And the greatest of these is the privilege of owning land or other natural resources and using the mere fact of ownership as a means of extorting tribute. Never will the world be in such need of the products of labor as after the war. Food, clothing, better and more houses, will be sorely needed. And they will not be forthcoming because the bankers and landowners will find it more profitable to hold the natural resources and the plants which depend upon these resources for raw materials idle and out of use, until they can be sure of big profits over and above the cost of producing. -The annual report of the Republic Iron and Steel Company shows earnings last year equal to $5L89 a share. -After deducting $9,878,657 for excess profits, a sum equal to almost 30 per cent, on the common stock, net profits were $15,857,196.. In 1916 earnings were equal to $47.95 a share, so that in the two years ended December 31, 1917, the company has earned $99.83 a share. -Total profits were $28,769,024 last year compared with $16,893,212 the year previous. Surplus for the year was $12,475,737. compared with $9,881,298 in 1916. -London, March — The national executive of the British Labor Party, always working in conjunction with the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress and thus covering the labor movement from the economic as well as from the political standpoint, is now building itself up for big Parliamentary action at a rapid rate. The two committees have just now taken special offices in the central part of London, one portion of these having been formerly occupied by Winston Churchill, the Minister of Munitions, who has cleared out for still more commodious premises elsewhere. Under the wonderful driving power of Arthur Henderson, who is labor\\'s leading politician in this country and who $ince he broke with the Governbent and retired from the War Cabinet, has been working ceaselessly for the creation of a great Parliamentary labor party in the House of Commons (to arise after the next general election), the movement is making rapid headway. Henderson and his colleagues of the Labor Party, together with Bowertnan and his colleagues of the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress, are using as the new factor in the situation the passing of the Representation of the People Act. -This new measure has created an entirely new situation. The number of Parliamentary voters in this country will be increased from 8,000,000 to over 16,000,000, and about 6,000,000 of these new voters will be women, who will for the first time in this country at the next election exercise voting power. It is to meet this factor that the Labor Party is developing its entirely new constitution and it wants to use the new political force it expects to obtain in order to tackle powerfully and successfully the great problems of reconstruction after the war, whether these problems be political, social, industrial or economic. -It is declared that no treatment by mere politicians will meet the case, no mere compromise will serve ; no desire to get back once more to the old lines of safeguarding j^elfish bourgeois interests -will satisfy the masses of the people. For the first tirrie in this country \"the will of the people\" is to be no longer an empty phrase. When the reconstructed Labor Party gets its new political force behind it in the House of Commons it will want to secure, it declares, for the producers by hand and by brain the full fruits of their industry. The producers are no longer going to be satisfied with the crumbs which fall from the rich man\\'s table; therefore, the Labor Party wants to be able to force the most equitable distribution of the fruits of industry that may be possible on the basis of common ownership of the means of production. The Labor Party\\'s program insists that the nation should take no step backwards from the present policy of controlling the great industries and services. -At the moment, of course, the new constitution is before the various con\\' stituent societies of the Labor Partv and before the bodies also affiliated with the Trade Union Congress. A few weeks more must pass before the final decision is known as to what fo/m this eventful constitution will take ; T)ut what I have forecasted can be reckoned to be pretty generally accurate, although details to meet individual cases may here and there be modified. -The Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress and the National Executive of the Labor Party, meeting in joint committee, declare that they have reached decisions of considerable importance affecting the methods of representation of British labor at future international conventions. Separate representation of British Socialist organizations is to be ended. That should mean that in future the Independent Labor Party, which has about 30,000 members ; the British Socialist Party, with about 20,000; and the Fabian Society, with 30,000, will no longer themselves send direct representatives to these international Socialist and Labor conventions. They will have to take their chance now of getting their own special delegates through with the general labor delegates. -As, however, Socialists of resources are found at the head of affairs in both important trade unions and in important positions in the national executive of the Labor Party, probably things will not change much in actual character until systems alter. -An important deputation left London for Paris recently. It was composed of Arthur Henderson, M. P., Ramsay Macdonald, M. P. ; J. McGurk and Sidney Webb, representing the Labor Party; and C. W. Bowerman, M. P.; J. H. Thomas, M. P.; Will Thorne, M. P., representing the Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union Congress, to discuss international labor and war affairs with the French labor organizations. -\\' A very interesting attempt was made by the Bishop of Peterborough, England, to bring up the question of labor and its proper rewards before the upper house of the convocation at Canterbury, which is the ecclestiasti(;al authority governing the Church of England. Usually such meetings of bishops and other church officials concern themselves mainly with questions of church doctrine, discipline and government. Gradually, however, a different and broader note is showing itself. At the abovementioned meeting the Bishop of Peterborough brought forward the question of industrial reconstruction after the war and moved the following resolution: -That it is incumbent upon the church at the present time to do all in its power to second the efforts now being made in many quarters to inaugurate a truer fellowship, both in spirit and in organization, between all who are engaged in the industries of the nation, and particularly in view of the critical period which will follow the conclusion of peace. -The Bishop quoted from a statement of Arthur Henderson, in the London \"Times,\" to the effect that at no period during the war has the industrial situation been so grave and so pregnant with disastrous possibilities as it is today. Yet, he said, the stress of the situation did not lie only or even mainly in the present emergency. Today seven millions of our wage earners were engaged -in war work. The moment peace was certain every effort would be made to stop this expenditure and gradually to reduce this work to more normal dimensions. This would probably mean, unless the utmost care and foresight were exercised, unemplo)mient on a colossal scale, reduction of wages and lowering of standard rates owing to the glut of labor available; and this at a time of grave discontent with our industrial system. It ever the nation had the need and the right to call to the church for spiritual help, that would be the moment. -There must be a determination in the church as well as in the state frankly to face the difficulties. In the nation and in all classes there were men who could only be described as antifellowship men, including the profiteers and reactionary employers, men who showed themselves wholly out of touch with the sentiment and outlook of the workers, and were planning to make a few leisurely repairs in a powder magazine which might at any moment explode and blow them to pieces. -At the present time the church\\'s conscience was fast leaping into life and if the state had its care fully thought-out plans for the coming days of peace so must the church. Their first duty was to think. Let them all bring fresh minds to fresh problems. Such thought would lead at once to a revision of values. It would show up the absurd importance which during the last 100 years had been attached to money. Hitherto the church had been content to acquiesce, not merely in the exaggerated estimate of money, but in the spending of it. Before the war we were rich with an almost nauseating ostentation. Bond street (London\\'s fashionable shopping thoroughfare) reeked with luxurious irrelevancies. Yet we were too poor to build either houses for our townspeople or decent cottages for our laborers. The revision of values would lead to the conception of industry as a national service rather than a private adventure for profit. The nationalization of the railways after the war was to be desired from an economic point of view. He did not deny that the views he had expressed would be strong meat for some. People might shout \"Socialism\" at the top of their voices. -He had never been a professed socialist, but he had come to believe that we were bein^ urged along some such path as he had mdicated, not merely by the spirit of the age, but by the spirit of Him who was the King of the Ages. -So much for the Bishop. The resolution, however, was withdrawn by request, as the Convention was nearing its finish and very few delegates were present. It will be brought up at the next Convocation meeting. — National Labor ^Tribune. -A story is extant in which French profiteers got a taste of American methods. The story comes from a seaport \"somewhere in France\" and is as follows: -\\'\\'The landlord of one of the principal hotels, finding his rooms all taken by American officers, considered that the law of supply and demand justified in his case a considerable increase in profits. The price of rooms was doubled; meals and drinks went up in proportion. -\"Rear Admiral Wilson waited upon the mayor, who regretted the fact, but found himself unable to interfere with the freedom of commerce. -\"Admiral Wilson ordered the officers living there to move out and placed sentries in front of the building with orders to keep every American soldier away. -\"The argument was decisive. The landlord begged that the interdictions be removed, but thus far Admiral Wilson is obdurate and the hotel is almost empty.\" -It will be noted that the admiral first had recourse to the law— and got nothing. Then he resorted to the good old American expedient of boycott — and got results. -The boycott time and again has been decried by its victims as unfair, even though it usually is employed against unfairness. Court after Court, in willing subservience to capital, has forbidden its use by labor to enforce just, fair and reasonable conditions, but no court could ever make the workers support an unfair concern.. Court mandates do not reach that far. -Admiral Wilson\\'s first thought when the law failed was the boycott. Everyone of fair mind and normal thinking powers will applaud his act, express satisfaction at what -he did and say it was just the right thing to stop profiteering and punish a greedy and unpatriotic landlord. -But in America were the admiral the representative of a labor organization and the landlord the representative of the large employers, it would no doubt be easy to find a judge to declare the boycott unlawful and issue an injunction against it because it interfered with the process of private gain. -But where lies the moral difference in boycotting this profiteering landlord and boycotting, for instance, a theater, a transfer company, a printing establishment which opposes, for its own profit, a better standard of living for the people whom it employs? The landlord tried to take advantage of his customers to swell his profits. In the other cases mentioned advantage is taken of the workers to compel them to work cheaply, thus enhancing unfairly the profits of the employers and keeping down unfairly the wages of the employees. -Where lies the difference betv(een the boycott established by the admiral and a boycott, for instance, against a company which has adopted a policy of favoritism toward a few scabs, in the hope of breaking down the power of collective bargaining, and keeping the manly man in its employ from securing the real wages whiph every American worker should enjoy? -A boycott is a boycott. But its operation unimpeded of the law depends upon who is exercising it — an American Admiral or a bunch of American workingmen. — ^Exchange. -It was Winter, and at two o\\'clock p.m. night began to grow out of the corners. The frosted, white windows, sunk deep in the ground, became darker and darker. -\"Nor can I.\" Let someone light the lamp.\" \\'Outside there is still full daylight.\" \"But here it is quite dark.\" \"Here it is dark all day long.\" -Thus they threw at each other short phrases. They all talked with irritation, and annoyance. No one wanted to begin the night so early, and even though they did not see to do their work the workers* eyes were as if glued to the blocks of wood in front of them. They worked for a few minutes, took another peep out of the window and again started complaining that it was dark. -Josh sat down on the bench. He would like to see the lamp burning all day. He sat quietly without moving a limb. -\"Naphtal,\" someone called, \"how much do you want to go down into the *hole* ? (a cellar below the basement.) -The \"hole\" was believed to be the abode of ghosts. But though it had no more light at any time Naphtal, in the daytime, undertook to go down there for tio more than 25 roubles. -They worked about an hour or an hour and a half, when Naphtal looked at his midget nickel watch. He continued looking at it for a full minute, as if not -The workers imagined that they had been working by lamplight ever so long. Their hearts grew heavy and sad, as if they had just heard the blackest tidings, and their work became burdensome, disgusting. They were all seized with the desire to run away quietly, some where, far, very far. -Naphtal stood downcast, feeling guilty. He looked sadly at his doomed watch which was just declared as being cheap and worthless. He gazed at its fingers and seemed debating with himself whether to slip it back into his pocket or fling it away. -Suddenly Nyman crossed over and, wresting the watch from his grasp, examined it, put it to his ear, listened to its ticking and looked extremely bewildered. -Nyman did not answer, as if he had not heard the questions. Again he looked at the face of the watch and listened to it. It seemed to have a faint ticking. He was stirred by an impulse. Perhaps it was losing? Finally he returned the watch in silence, restrained his annoyance, walked back to his bench and lazily resumed his work. -Silence supervened in the basement. A forced but gnawing stillness pervaded all hearts. The feeling was akin to that of an enchanted black snake encircling the heart, sucking its life blood, crushing the very soul, the heart becoming empty and the soul filling with a vague longing. -Josh groaned. This time the younger element did not laugh at the old comical man. It seemed to theni that the groans came from a long distance; that they were uttered by thousands of men like him — men who had spent all their vital strength, their whole life. -They stopped the machines, examined and oiled them and continued working. No one said a word. They were all absorbed in their gloomy thoughts. They forgot each other\\'s existence. All felt lonely, God-forsaken and alone in a cellar, the walls of which frowned at each other and the grimy ceiling, draped in a sort of cobweb frills that were moving to and fro, looked down in sadness on the black dirty floor. -Again they resumed their work, each one of them evincing much impatience in his own way. One stamped with his foot, another cut deep furrows into his block of wood in sheer annoyance, yet another uttered curses. When the force of the inner excitement had run its course silence again prevailed and only the sound of the machines was heard in the room. -Josh replied with a mild glance, while they all joked at his expense. But Josh took it all good-humoredly. All of them made for the door. No one wanted to remain in the shop the last. Suddenly the door opened and the boss entered, wrapped in a fur coat. -Their countenances fell and they returned to the benches with slow steps, as if following a corpse to its grave. -STATEMENT OF THE OWNERSHIP, MANAGEMENT, etc., of the LADIES\\' GARMENT WORKER, published monthly at New York.

Baneful was the condition of the organization in 1914. Our International then practically consisted of two local unions — the Cloakmakers and Waistmakefs — both in New York, and even in these two unions the situation was uncertain. The Cloakmakers\\' Union had only just emerged from the \"celebrated Hourwich affair,\" which had nearly compassed its destruction. The Waist and Dressmakers\\' Union equally found itself in an insecure position. The old-time estimate of the pessimists that immigrants do not make good union men, that they know how to strike vigorously, but lack the ability of maintaining a stable organization, befogged all minds. Everyone asked himself: Perhaps the estimate is correct after all? Perhaps our people are constituted by na\\'ture to be shifty and unsteadfast and all attempts to organize them are bound to fail? -In the cities out of New YoYk we had some locals of cloakmakers and other workers, but they were of small significance. The employers hardly reckoned with them and the workers attached no importance to them. -It was a weak and broken International organization that the present administration took over four years ago and was fully conscious of the fact. The present administration knew the gigantic task confronting it, and therefore plunged into the work with all the energy of which it was capable. The one thing that sustained it was the faith and confidence in the possibility of surmounting the difficulties; the conviction that our trades can be organized and that the International can and will become one of the most powerful labor organizations in America. -Hard, bitter times followed — storms without and troubles within. First the protocol was abrogated and the strike danger faced us for months. -We left nothing undone to avoid a struggle. The most prominent men of the city of New York, even the entire capitalist press, were ranged on our side. The conferences at City Hall stirred the land and the award by the Council of Conciliation was the sensation of the day. But all this proved of little avail. The manufacturers felt convinced in their own minds that we were weak, and sought an opportunity to destroy us. Finally they forced the great general strike upon us. -And this general strike they forced upon us at a time when our energies were strained to the utmost to establish the innocence of our eight arrested brothers, whom the scab-herder Sulkess involved in a false murder charge. -lojoking back at those occurrences and contemplating them with cool, dispassionate minds, we are disposed to say that the strike was our good fortune. It has once for all established the fact, both for us and the employers that the union is here to stay; that it is no longer a passing thing but a permanent institution, resting on firm ground. That bitter sruggle dispelled the doubt in the minds of our friends and the hopes in the bosom of our enemies. -In a certain sense the Local No. 1 episode may be regarded as a sequel to the general strike. Just as a fight was necessary to clear away all outside obstacles to the growth and development of our organization, so it was necessary to wage war on the obstacles within. Situations sometimes arise in the relations between men, that do not lend themselves to amicable adjustment, but must be settled by force. The Local No. 1 situation was of that character. It was incumbent on our International Union to demonstrate to the outside world and its own members that it is a responsible, progressive and disciplined army, and this was shown in its action toward the clique which had usurped the authority of the local and sought by its means to cause a split in the r^nks of the International. -The trouble afforded the administration an opportunity to demonstra?t^ its energy, ability and methods. If our large membership desires to gauge the competence and worth of the administration it need only take into account the manner in which this affair was handled. -At the same time the administration carried on organizing work throughout the county, in all branches of our industry. As already alluded to above the International Union four years ago consisted of a few locals in New York. In outside centers we had only charters. In the four years we have succeeded in establishing powerful organizations all over the land. Our control over the cloak trade is complete. There is only one exception — Cleveland. But even there much work has been done. The trenches are prepared, the army is ready and the morale of the workers is excellent. What is required is a strong offensive, and victory is certain. Had not the Local No. 1 clique obstructed our way we should now have counted Cleveland in the same category as Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston, Cincin-It should not be overlooked that the fates were against us. The first three years of our administration were fraught with difficulty and danger for our trades. Bitter slackness prevailed. There have been times when in the city of New York 25,000 to 30,000 of our members have gone idle for months. In slack time it is hard to maintain the existing organizations, let alone to organize new local unions. -Yet we have ventured and won. Among the delegates at this year\\'s convention all branches of our industry in all parts of the country will have representatives, and we hope that they will share our sentiment of satisfaction and gladness at the work done during the years in which we have eftjoyed their confidence. -^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^■J»*^^^^^^^^N^^^^^^<»iaWN^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*g»»^^^^^*g^^^^^^^^^^^^^ -m^^^^^^^^t^^fi0^^^^^^m^m^*^m^*^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^m^*^»^*^^^m^*^m^^^^^^^i^^^^^^*^^i^^^^^t^^^^*^^^*^^^*^^^*^^^^^*^^^^^*^^ -At the coming convention the question of week work will be taken up. We hoped that the delegates would have an easy task. But the result is not as expected. -As previously announced, the New York Joint Board had submitted the question to a referendum vote of its members engaged on piece work. The result, already known, shows a majority of less than a thousand votes for week work. Were the majority a very large one the delegates would have no difficulty in coming to a decision. In view of the knowledge that large masses of workers are enthusiastically in favor of the change they could decide there and then to open negotiations with the manufacturers concerning the proposition and to draw up a scale of wages, etc. -Since, however, the majority for week work is comparatively small we must proceed with caution. We must weigh the matter well before taking action. -We thoroughly realize how hard it is to get along with the old system of settling prices. The evils of discrimination and sub-manufacturing grow out of the piece work system. We fully understand the gain that would result to the members individually and to the union collectively from the establishment of week work in the entire trade. We have extensively spoken and written on the subject. -Yet we hold that we must be cautious, for the change would be radical and fundamental. It is one of those reforms which calls for enthusiasm and the exercise of a strong will by the mass of the workers. If a large minority is lukewarm and not quite convinced that the change must be made, it is necessary to be very careful before taking action. -It is for the convention to decide. Perhaps we can find a way of safely carrying out this necessary reform, even under the present circumstances. But the delegates to the convention will be well advised to preserve an earnest attitude in regard to every proposed step, and consider it with due deliberation, notwithstanding the fact that a majority voted in favor of the proposition. -The General Executive Board feels that its decision to buy Liberty Bonds for the sum of $100,000 expresses the wish and desire of the entire membership of the International Union. -The United States of America, of which we all are good and loyal citizens, is waging a life-and-death struggle with a militarist power that tramples upon and outrages every free country upon which it can manage to lay its blood-and-iron claws. -From the first day that Arnerica entered the war President Wilson has made it clear that we have nothing against the German people and that we are ready to sheath the sword and negotiate for peace, as soon as the German people call manage to form a democratic government — a government which will reckon with the will of the people. Our war is against a clique of Prussian Junkers and militarists who hold the German people in political bondage and who are seeking to fasten a yoke around the necks of all the free countries surrounding Germany. -A large majority of our membership has felt the prongs of a Junker power. They have suffered untold agonies under such a power in old Russia. We know what the world can expect from a Wilhelm, who, in reality, is not a whit better than Nicholas, but rather more cunning and wily. We see the peril and therefore must do all in our power to foil it. -The General Executive Board feels that it has done a small part of its duty to help freedom\\'s struggle everywhere and its auty to our country by the purchase of Liberty Bonds for $100,000. -May Day as an international labor day has been always celebrated by Socialistic workers in Europe and America in parades and demonstrations in the streets. But owing to the war the First of May has more or less Idst its outward pomp. Today, in the fourth year of the war, when the world mourns its slaughtered children, its desolated cities and loss of billions of treasure, there would be no sense in celebrating the day in the old, noisy style. -But, the liberating thought for labor that the First of May stands for has not been weakened, but rather strengthened very much. Labor in the biggest, freest countries has received considerable recognition. Thus the first of May and its message for the workers has assumed a more practical aspect. Formerly the day was devoted to agitation mostly for an eight-hour day. Today the eight-hour day, where labor is organized, has become a reality almost everywhere. Formerly we were wont to demons-trate our solidarity with the workers of the whole world. Today the solidarity of the freest and most civilized peoples is knit together in a titanic struggle for liberty, popular rights and the rights of nations. Today we all feel that the only stumbling block to our real national, political and economic emancipation is the dark power of Junkerism. -Nationally the workers of England and America are more strongly organized than years ago and their influence is more extensively and profoundly felt. We are in the midst of a period of real transition. The realization of the ideals which International Labor Day has always expressed has become much nearer to us than we hoped for only four years ago. It now depends merely on the issue of the war. If the free democratic countries will secure the final victory, we shall before long stand on the threshold of a new and juster social order. It is in this sense that we contemplate the First of May, 1918, and that our cloakmakers, waistmakers, whitegoods workers and other members, will celebrate the day. -Socialists and Socialistic workers rightly view the celebration of the Karl Marx 100th anniversary as if he lived with us in the flesh. Marx\\'s body died more than thirty years ago, but his spirit lives and acts within us today far more eflfectively than it did in the masses of the workers during his lifetime. What has rendered this great man immortal for the workers of the world ? -In another column Herman Schluetcr writes more fully on the life and creative work of the father and founder of scientific Socialism. The theories and ideas of this great teacher of the workers have since become common property. They float about in the minds of the toiling masses consciously and unconsciously. Perhaps we do not express them in such words as Marx has expressed them. But their meaning is felt in the souls of all oppressed wage slaves, who toil and moil and others enjoy the fruits of their labor. -As yet in 1848, Karl Marx and Frederick Engels in the \"Communist Manifesto*\\' framed this call to the labor masses : \"Workers of all countries unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains and a world to gain.\" Ever since that year this call has been a magic word for the workers. Expressed at every gathering and displayed upon labor publications the slogan has stirred and inspired the people. -\"Workers of all countries unite!\" The slogan has lost nothing of its force and freshness. It still powerfully re-echoes in the hearts and minds. Those workers who have united and organized have much reason to celebrate on May S the 100th anniversary of Karl Marx. The fact that they now have better labor conditions, lighter burdens in the shops and factories and brighter prospects for the future they have much to be thankful for to the world-renowned teacher and thinker, Karl Marx. -A hundred years ago, on the fifth of May, 1918, at Trier, in the Rhineland, Karl Marx was bom, a man to whom the working class of the world owes more than to any other human being. Despite the raging war and despite the thunder of battle, he will, therefore be remembered during these days in all countries and in all tongues, on this and on yonder side as a man who has devoted all his rich knowledge, all his great abilities towards the one aim: THE EMANCIPATION OF THE WORKING CLASS! -His rich knowledge I As Darwin has discovered the law of evolution of organic nature, so has Karl Marx discovered the law of evolution of human history. It was Marx who established the simple historical fact that all the various forms of human society depend upon how people eat, drink, live and clothe themselves and how they obtain the means of subsistence. Each step of economic evolution of a people or of a period, therefore, forms the basis \"from which the political structure of the State, the conception of law, art and even the religious idea of the people in question have developed and out of which they must ^so be explained — ^not, as has heretofore been the case, but the contrary.^^— Engels. -Besides this great scientific discovery, by which human history was put upon its real basis and by which particularly the class-character of all previous society was put into the proper light, Marx has established the special law of evolution of the present capitalistic production and the bourgeois society created by it He discovered that all social wealth is accumulated surplus value; surplus value, which the worker has created above his pay; value, which the capitalist pockets without giving the worker any compensation for it; value, accumulated for that purpose to exploit the worker with it and by it still more. -The materialistic conception of history and the theorjr of surplus value — ^these are the two most important scientific discoveries of Karl Marx. Both of them still form the basis of the entire Socialistic theory of today iaid without it the labor movement of the world would not even now, have an insight into their real task and no perception of their actual aim. -And therein Karl Marx saw his life\\'s task: he wanted to enlighten the workers about their historical mission; wanted to -show them the road to their final emancipation! He pursued his scientific researches not for the sake of science— and there he differed from the ordinary representative of science — ^bnt he wanted to put his knowledge at the service of the working class. \"Science was for Marx a motive, a revolutionary force\" and to have placed this revolutionary force at the disposal of the labor movement of the world— that is the great merit of this ^eat thinker and fighter. -And from his early youth the great knowledge of this extraordinary man has been at the service of the labor movement of the world. -There hardly existed putside of England — a movement of the working dass, when the eagle eye of Marx already perceived its historic importance. At that time already he gave to the workers the famous motto: \"Proletarians of all Nations, unite!\" which has since become the battle cry of the workers of the entire world. At that time he already began to devote his entire knowledge and his whole power to the realization of this sentence and to prepare the working masses for this revolutionary task. \"Because Marx was above all a revolutionist To co-operate, in this or any other manner, in the overthrow of capitalistic society and the political institutions <:reated by it, to aid in the emancipation of the modem proletariat, to which he had first given the consciousness of its own condition and necessities, consciousness of the conditions for its emancipation — ^that was his true life vocation.\\'^ — ^Engels. -And this vocation he foUowed when he created the International Workingmen\\'s Association and gave it aim and substance. And he has fiUed this vocation with his numerous writings, wiUi his work, with all his actions to the end of his life. -And, therefore, today, on his hundredth anniversary, he will be remembered in every hut, factory and workshop, from the icy fields of Siberia to the sunny coast of the Pacific. And, therefore, today all clearsighted workers of all countries reach luuids across the battle fields and gain consolation and hope for the future from the great words of Marx, which will become reality for all that and all that: -Within recent months the British Labor Party has emerged to the surface as the most forceful section of the labor movement of the world. Ever since ^e outbreak of the war in 1914 there have been many Socialist and Labor declarations by celebrated leaders in Europe about the prospects of labor after the war.. None of these declarations, however, has carried witih it the power of inspiring the world of labor so strongly as the report and recommendations of the Sub-Committee of the British Labor Party submitted to its conference in London three months ago. -The British Labor Part^ works by more or less positive, constructive methods. All sections of the labor movement in England are now knit together politicallyi In the prosecution of the war all parties, includmf the \\'\\'Laborites\\'\\' and Socialists, work with the government, but of their own free will, without any compulsion whatever, and they work together like practical business people who have a clear understanding. The British workers are paMots, but they admit aiming at the conquest of political and economic power which rightly belongs to them because they are the mainstay of the nation. This explains why they have made certain concessions asked by the government. But they have therebv improved their position and extended their influence. -It is interesting to know what it is that has recently made the British Labor Partv so prominent before the world. Until lately the Labor Party was composed of -Before the Labor Party was organized all these organizations were disunited and sometimes at loggerheads. In the Labor Party they are politically united. Formerly the larger organizations had put forward their own candidates in opposition to each other and most of them were defeated, but since the Labor Party has been in existence, all organized workers and radical elements have an opportunity to nominate the best candidates. Bach organization is entitJed to run a certain number of candidates, and at the elections they are all able to combine, beat the capitalist candidates and elect their -The British Labor Party naturally shares the character of the British people. It is slow-going, cold-blooded, deliberate and determined. The trade unions, comprising the majority of the Party, have never relied too much on theories, however high-sounding they might be. \"An ounce of practice is mott than a pound of theory,\" has ever been the guiding idea of all practical men at the head of me British labor movement Thus the Party in its first years did not show any signs of a revolutionary character, and this made the radicals at home impatient with its tactics, while the radicals abroad treated it with silent contempt This was before the war. -But the war has revealed the light and shade of the labor movement in the principal countries of Europe. Revolutionists showed themselves to be conservatives beneath the surface, while they who had been thought conservatives emerged to the surface as real revolutionists. -The much criticized British Labor Party has quite recently demonstrated its reyolu^ tionary spirit. Its statement of aims is a (;^uickening word and \\'a source of inspiration to all progressive workers everywnere. Did this attitude come suddenly? No. The Labor Party had this revolutionary trait, but it did not care to put the cart before the horse. In consonance with the British character it waited for a favorable opportunity, and the fourth year of the \\'war has provided this opportunity. Incidentally the fact is disclosed — a fact not generally known in American labor circles — ^that the British labor movement has a definite philosophy and a definite aim for the immediate future. This is something which as yet the American labor movement has not -We need to beware of patchwork. . . . What has to be reconstructed after the war is not this or that government department . . . but so far as Britain is concerned, society itself. . . . We of the Labor Party recognize, in the present world catastrophe if not the death, in Europe, of civilization itself, at any rate the culmination and collapse of a distinctive industrial civilization, which the workers will not seek to reconstruct. At such times of crisis it is easier to slip into ruin than to progress into higher forms of organization. . . . -If we in Britain are to escape from the decay of civilization itself ... we must insure that what is presently to be built up is a new social order, based not on fighting -but on fraternity — not on the competitive struggle for the means of bare life, but on a deliberately planned co-operation in production and distribution for the benefit of all who participate bv hand or brain — not on the utmost possible inequality of riches, but on a systematic approach towards a healthy equality of material circumstances for every person bom into the world; not on an enforced dominion over subject nations, subject races, subject colonies, subject classes, or a subject sex, but, in industry as well as in government, on that equal freedom, that general consciousness of consent, and that widest possible participation in power, both economic and political, which is characteristic of democracy. We do not pretend that it is possible, even after the drastic clearing away that is now going on, to build society anew in a vear or two of feverish \"reconstruction.\" What the Labor Party intends to satisfy itself about is that each brick that it helps to lay shall go to erect the structure that it intends, and no other, -Then follow a number of practical propodtiont api^cable to local drciimstancet in England. The party demands: -l,-\"The tinivertal enforcement of a naminimum.^ This ii explained to mean iht legiiladve regulation of labor and employment; securing emplo3rment for all; social insurance agamst unemployment. -, 2. Democratic Control of Industry. This is interpreted to mean that all, men and women shall be completely free in the exercise of political rights; that the land and industries shall speedily become nationalized, and such industries as remain in capitalist hands shall be subject to control. -3. National finance shall be revolutionised. This means that the war debt shall be covered by a system of \"direct taxation of incomes above the necessary cost of familv maintenance.\" It means that all who nave larger incomes shall pay a graduated tax. -4. That the surplus of wealth shall be appropriated and applied to the common good, for the good and welfare of all. It shall go towara easing the burden of toil, giving more lisht, affordin|^ more spiritual enjoyment, education, enlightenment and general happmess. -The British Labor Part}r has also underp^one internal reorganization. Heretofore mdividual members could not belong to it, and it consisted of the leaders of affiliated organizations. Now it has assumed the character of an organization formed of branches or locals whose membership mav include also brain workers who agree with its aims. Women workers will form separate branches, which will be represented on the executive committee. Some 6,000,000 women have recently been enfranchised. In -England there is no doubt that the new element of politically enfranchised women will help to make the Labor Party a power in the land. -Reports from London refer to a widespread belief, based on a statement by Arthur Henderson, secretary of the party, that at the next reneral election the Labor Party will contest 400 seats. It is well to remember that in 1906 the partv ran fifty candidates of whom twenty-nme were elected. In 1910 there were two elections. At the first election the party ran seventy-eight candidates and 40 were elected. At tne second election forty-two out of fifty-six candidates were successftd. At the present time the party has thirty-eight menibers in the British Parliament -9o far 155 labor candidates have been already chosen foe nomination by the various organizations. In this connection it is interesting to note how some of the unions intend to act in this regard. Thus it is re-Sorted that the Miners\\' Federation of rreat Britain has decided to contest fiftytwo seats; the Amalgamated Society of Engineers twelve seats; the National Un£6n of Teachers, the Sailors\\' and Firemen\\'s Union and the BoDermakers\\' Society six each, the Textile Workers five; the National Union of Railwaymen four and the Boot and Shoe Operatives three. As to local labor parties, most of them will contest a number of seats, while many smaller unions and party branches will support the labor candioates of their district -The Independent Labor Party is preparing to run thirty-five candidates; the Brnish Socialist Party tiiirteen and in the London district which sends sixty-tw6 members of Parliament it is intended to run candidates in every Parliamentary constituency. -In conclusion it should be mentioned that in regard to International relations the Labor Party seeks to co-operate with the organized woricers of all coimtries and work for a league of nations to maintain peace and liberty and setde international disputes by cociliadon and arbitration. -For first hand ladies\\' tailors, 7.50 francs: second hands, 6.50 francs, with additional increases necessitated by the higher cost of living. -Furriers likewise demanded a minimum wage; equal wages for equal work for all workers; orivilesre of shop chairmen: the Saturday half-holiday applying to all workers; and minor improvements. -I am inclined to believe that some of our members, on reading the above heading, will feel dissatisned and mutter to themselves: -\"Again we are asked for a higher per capita. Why come to us so very often for higher payments? First organize strong unions and give us increased earnings and then demand of us a higher per capita/\\' -And these members will think themselves smart and original. They do not seem to realize that their way of thinking of the union and its benefits and possibilities for the workers is wrong and illogical. They evidently fail to see that the per capita paid to the International determines the activity of our union and its success. -Let us analyze the cry of \"give us increased earnings and then demand of US higher per capita.\" Does it seem to these members that the work of organizing strong and powerful locals and winning for the workers higher wage standards is something that can be attained by the International officers saying their prayers? -How are unions organized ? First of all we need intelligent, devoted and true leaders to undertake the task of spreading the idea of labor solidarity among the workersThey must arouse them to a sense of self-respect and keep urging them to strive for improved conditions of life. By constant agitation they must imbue the hearts of the workers with hope and faith in the power of unity. This cannot be done by mere contemplation. Energetic effort must be applied ; frequent personal contact with the workers is necessary ; educational literature has to be distributed. For all this money is required to crown the work with success. -And when this educational work has been attended with success and the workers have begun to perceive that they are entitled to a better livelihood, -and that to attain it they must be organized in a union, the question arises how to bring this about and with it — felief and improvements. The employers remain indifferent to the movement. Having for years exploited the workers they do not easily give up their profiteering tactics, and refuse to give up their unlimited domination over the workers without a struggle. This leads to the next step in the organizing campaign — forcing the employers to make concessions by asserting the power of the union. A general strike has to be called in the industry. -The success of the strike does not depend on the enthusiasm of the strikers alone. Very often the manufacturers are stubborn and refuse to give in to the union* They derive strength from the workers\\' helpless condition, knowing that their \"hands\" could not save money from the miserable wages they received to carry them through the strike, and they rely upon the starvation of the strikers to deaden their enthusiasm and bring their victims back to the factories. Therefore, in order that the employers should not triumph over the workers and that their diabolic idea of reducing them to submission by starvation should not be realized, the union must stand by them and provide the strikers with the means of life. Our brave fighters must not be allowed to reach the starvation point, and an ample supply of money IS required to keep up the good fight and encourage the men and women to Stand firm for easier conditions and better wages. -This money supply must come from the funds of the International. It is to carry on this noble work that the International Union was organized; and such funds are derived from the per capita paid by the general membership. The larger the receipts from this source and the richer the general treasury the surer the success with which -In my article \"Our Organizing Campaigns,\" in the March issue of the Ladies\\' Garment Worker I pointed out the importance and necessity of this organizing work of the International Union. That,, together with what I am saying here, should show the opponents of a higher per capita the connection between successful organizing campaigns and the per capita dues paid to the International. -We shall probably be asked the question : Did not the thirteenth convention in Philadelphia raise the per capita to 4 cents, 1^ cents more than formerly? It was then computed by some delegates that the lJ/2 cents increase would bring in tens of thousands of dollars and enable the International Union to proceed with its organizing campaigns more freely than ever. Why then this demand again for a higher per capita? -In answer to this I want to point out to our members that the centers which now call for organizing campaigns differ from the centers of past endeavors. We are now confronted by a different element which is harder to reach by the ordinary means of agitation. This element has no idea of the trade union movement. I amreferring to the native American wdmen workers in our industry, who have been brought up with antipathy to trade unionism, who believe that it is a movement for immigrants and that they are altogether superior to it. To organize this element much more energy, patience and financial resources are required. In spite of energetic campaigns in several such centers of industry we have not succeeded in rallying these workers to the banner of unionism. -Thus the delegates will have no difficulty to understand that if we want to organize completely our industry throughout the land we must tackle these new centers. If my opinion ha^ any value I want to stress the point that the necessity of organizing the workers everywhere is more urgent -than ever because our industry is extending everywhere. Ladies\\' garment factories are now being found in almost all cities, and the workers in these factories are of the character referred to above. Everyone who has been active in the work of building our unions must come to the conclusion that our International Union must in the near future transfer its activity to the new centres, where employers find obedient slaves. There we must disseminate the ideas of unity and cooperation in order to insure the existence of our unions and the earnings of our members. -Those who are opposed to a higher per capita will see from the foregoing that although we conducted successful organizing campaigns, organized unions and improved conditions with 2j/^ cents per capita, our new field of organizing endeavor is harder to tackle even with our present 4 cents per capita. For with all our active campaigning we have not succeeded in building up unions and gaining additional members in those new fields. -Our members should also bear in mind that our International Union in the past availed itself of Article 7, Section 1 of our constitution, which reads as follows: -The General Executive Board shall have the power to declare a levy of ten cents per member per week on all affiliated unions for a continuous period not exceeding fifteen (15) weeks in any one year, to assist in the support of an affiliated organization engaged in a protracted strike or lockout. The locals shall collect the assessment from the members through assessment stamps issued by the International Ladies\\' Garment Workers* Union. -Formerly the General Executive Board exercised its constitutional right of levying these assessments almost every yearTogether with the assessments the revenues of the International amounted to more than 2j4 cents per member. The following figures will show that for the year 1916 the revenue of the International Union, from a 2J4 cents per capita including assess-The second matter which I should like to bring to the attention of the next convention is the subject of the stand to be taken by the I. L. G. W. U. in regard to \"social, or health insurance.\" -As is well known, the question of compulsory health or sickness insurance has been brought up in many states and already has been introduced by ten of the largest international labor tmions. The New York State Federation of Labor has during 1917 and 1918 joined this great movement and introduced a bill in the legislature for this insurance. In ten other states such legislation has already been introduced and there is no^ doubt that health insurance is soon to* become a law. -The I. L. G. W. U., one of the most progressive of all labor organizations in the country, should stand squarely for the laudable proposition of health insurance accepted by most of the enlightened labor organizations in the country and should join this great movement in distributing the cost of sickness, invalidity and unemployment on the whole industry and the whole population, instead of making them a burden only on the workers themselves. -With the organization of medical benefits in the various locals of the I. L. G. W. U. and with the adoption of tuberculosis benefit for the whole International, and with the assistance of the Joint Board of Sanitary Control, which is practically the Health Department of the whole industry, in New York, it will be feasible to control the health benefits, after the health insurance becomes a law, by the unions themselves, thus making health insurance a matter of union and local control. -The United States bureau of labor statistict reports that a wage of $1,500 a year will only provide \"the minimutn standard of comfort.\" -In other words, this governmental agency declares that if a worker does not receive $5 a day for 300 workinfl^ days in the year he cannot support a family in the most restricted kind of comfort. -Washington, April 20. — ^The cost of maintaining a family in this country has doubled since 1900, according to the united States bureau of labor statistics. Figures, just made public, show that the average cost in 1900 was $679. During 1917 the cost of the same commodities was $1401. Food alone in 1917 cost only $53 less than all items combined in 1900. $327 represented the expenditure for food of the average working man\\'s family m 1900. By 1911 this had risen to $430 and in 1917 it cost $716. Rent had advanced 59 per cent Clothing doubled, riung from $106 to $210. Fuel and lighting snow a similar advance rising from $40 to $82. Most of the advance in all these items occurred between 1914 and 1917. The 1917 figures, the bureau says, are already outdated because of subsequent advances. The minimum standard of comfort today requires a wage of approximately $1500 per year. The average of 24 American cities is that the minimum amount necessary for a reasonable standard of health and comfort in those 24 principal American cities is $1650, of which $660 is spent for food. Investigation by the department of health in New York city fixed the figure for that city at $1682. -The above figures do not include increases in the cost of such things as amusements, charity, insurance, taxes, books, newspapers, or expenses incident to sickness and death. -I expect to pass through this world but once; if, therefore, there be any kindness I can show, or anv good thing I can do, let me do it now, for I shall not pass this way again. — Anon. -Washington, April 20. — ^The department of labor and the United States shipping board are attempting to work out a system whereby wages will be regulated to compensate for the increased cost of living. -This plan is accepted by some British manufacturers, especially in the textile industries. In Lancaster and other cities in England ap agreement has been effected by employers and the workers whereby wages are made to fluctuate in accordance with figures on the cost of living prepared by the British Board of Trade. About 60,000 workers are included in these agreements which cover all classes of textile, workers except mechanics and those engag\\'ed in the maintenance Of the plants. -Early last month representative officers of five international unions appointed on the War Labor Conference Board published their recommendations for maintaining industrial peace during war time. In Uiese recommendations the United States Govemment is asked to adopt a policy officially recognizing organized labor. -^ The creation of a national war labor board is proposed with functions and powers of bringing about settlement of labor disputes by mediation and conciliation through appropriate machineiy of committees or boards sitting in various parts of the country ^md having a well-defined authority. -It is provided that the board in its work of mediation and conciliation shall be governed by the following principles: -The right of workers to organize in trade unions and to bargain collectively, through Qhosen representatives, is recognized and affirmed. This right shall not be denied, abridged or interfered with by the employers in any manner whatsoever. -The right of employers to organize in associations of groups and to bargain collectively through chosen representatives, is recognized and affirmed. This right shall not be denied, abridged or interfered with by the workers in any manner whatsoever. -Employers should not discharge workers for membership in trade unions, nor for legitimate trade union activities. -The workers, in the exercise of their right to organize, shall not use coercive measures of any kind to induce persons to join their organizations. -In establishments where the union shop exists the same, shall continue and the union standards as to wages, hours of labor and other conditions of employment shall be maintained. -In establishments where union and nonunion men and women now work together, and the employer meets only with employees or representatives engaged in said establishments, the continuance of such condition diall not be deemed a grievance. This declaration, however, is not intended in any manner to deny ^e right or discourage the practice of the formation of labor unions, or the joining of the same by the workers in said ettabhshments, m guaranteed in the last paragraph, nor to prevent the War Labor Board from tirgiiig or any umpire from ^rantinc, imder die machinery herein provided, improvement of their situation in the -matter of wages, hours of labor, or other conditions, as shall be found desirable from time to time. -Established safeguards and regulations for the protection of the health and safety of workers shall not be relaxed. -If it shall become necessary to employ women on work ordinarily performed by men, they must be allowed equal pay for equal work and must not be allotted tasks disproportionate to their strength. -The basic eight hour day is recognized as applying in all cases in which existing law requires it. In all other cases the question of hours of labor shall be settled with due regard to governmental necessities and the welfare, health and proper comfort of the workera. -For the purpose of mobilizing the labor supply with a view to its rapid and effective distribution, a permanent list of the number of skilled and other workers available in different parts of the nation shall be kept on file by the Department oi Labor, the information to be constantly furnished: -These agencies should be given opportunity to aid in the distribution of labor, as necessity demands. -In fixing wages, hours and conditions of labor regard should always be had to the labor standards, wage scales, and other conditions, prevailing in the localities affected. -In fixing wages, minimum rates of pay shall be established which will, insure the subsistence of the worker and his family in health and reasonable comfort -President Wilson subsequently approved the plan in a proclamation, calling upon all employera and employes to enlist the aid of the board in settling labor difficulties, and urges that there be no discontiiKuance of work which would interfere with production while negotiations 4ire in progress. -Washington, D. C. — Organized labor scored a victorjr in the house of representatives by securing exception of orderly or bona fide strikes for increased pay and better conditions from drastic penalties di^ rected at war-time interruption of* belligerent utilities. -The bill, which passed, provides a $10,000 fine, 30 vears\\' imprisonment or both for the willful iniury or destruction of war material, for wiufully making or causing to be made in a defective manner toy war material, or for conspiring to prevent the erection or production of such war premises or war utilities. -The last provision is limited in its operation by die clause that nothing in the act shall apply to the right of men to agree together to cease work or not to wofk if for the purpose of getting increased wages or for bettering ^eir conditions. -Chicago, 111. — ^As the culmination of an organizing campaign among stock >[ards\\' * workers started last June by the Chicago Federation of Labor, America\\'s packing industry has been swept into the eight-hour column. -To avoid a strike the packers agreed to arbitration and Federal Judge Alschuler has just ruled that beginning May 5 next eight hours shall be tne basic work da^, to be completed as far as possible withm a period of not more than nine consecutive hours.

Prior to this the workers presented demands and the antagonistic attitude of the packers developed siich a strike spirit among the workers that the government asked both sides to come to Washington to adjust di£Ferences. -Packers agreed to arbitrate, and almost immediately attempted to withdraw their signatures. They abandoned this position however, when the workers answered, \"Arbitrate or face a strike.\" It is hinted that Secretary of Labor Wilson expressed views on the packers\\' proposal that recalled the old days when he was an officer of the United Mine Workers. -The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey is flirting with organized labor\\'s theory of collective bargaining.

It tells us of the trials and tribulations that the workers of t)iis trade have undergone before they succeeded in building up this union. Now that this Local occupies an indisputable position within the International and in the progressive labor movement, it is interesting to note the conditions that had existed in this trade before it was organized and the progress it has made since then. -It was in 1909, when a handful of pressers of a few shops of that trade assembled somewhere in a small room in Brovmsville and discussed the then existing labor conditions. The workers complamed of long -hours; because while the earnings were regulated there was no limit to the hours. As long as the engine was in motion, the workers were at their machines, and so it was not very seldom that they worked 70 hours and more a week, but never less than 60 hours. -At that meeting the workers also complained that it was absolutely impossible for them to live on their meager earnings that seldom exce^ed |3 to $5 a week. One of the causes of the low earnings, was, in their opinion, the fact that the employers exploited learners. Learners worked between two and four weeks without compensation at all» and afterwards the employers were at liberty to fix the price, and the price seldom was above two dollars for a period of three or four weeks. -A curious grievance ventilated at that historical meeting was that of the workers of a certain shop that their employer sent one of the working girls to his home to take care of his baby while his wife went shopping. The workers of other shops complamed of being subjected to bad treatment and humiliation on the part of their employers, many of whom cursed them and used insultinflr language, which no person with any digmty can tolerate for a moment. -After these indictments against the employers it \\' became evident to all that the only way to improve conditions was by organized protest, by forming a union of all the workers in the trade. -a considerable number of the children\\'s dressmakers to join such an organization. Fear was expressed that the employers would notice such a movement among weir workers and discharge them, and that the 90 per cent women workers, the majority of whom were young girls who never heard anything abou a labor union, would hold aloof from the movement. -Finally the view of the few enthusiastic idealists prevailed, and it was decided to form a union.. A committee was appointed to go to the United Hebrew Traded and ask for a charter. -Thus the foundation of the union was laid, and the few members got busy. Everjr evening they waited outside of some btiildmg, where a children\\'s dressmakers\\' shop was located and called their fellow workers to join them in their effort to organize a union in the trade and so better their unbearable conditions. -Soon this group of pioneers succeeded in obtaining a charter from the International and afterward opened a small office. -In 1910, during the cloakmakers\\' strike, the union was uready strong enough to call out the workers on general strike. The strike was called in Brownsville, where the contractors were located. -The inhuman condidons of the workers in the children\\'s dress trade called for^ little attention on the part of the public. Strange to relate, the only men who were interested in ending this strike was the expressman who delivered the merchandise from the manufacturers to the contractor and carried it back. As the expressman also suffered from the strike he constituted himself as mediator and succeeded in bringing together both sides. Afterwards he acted in the capacity of ari>itrator. -The result of the strike was the shortening of the hours of labor from 60 and 70 to 53, and there was an understanding between the employers and the workers that in case of trouble a representative of the workers should be admitted to the shop, but the employers refused to sign a written agreement widi the local union. , -Encouraged by their first victory, the active members of the local succeeded in securing assistance from the International Union, and with the help of an organizer they carried on an energetic organizing campaign, not only among the workers of Williamsburg, Brooklvn, but also in Manhattan, New York. The result of this campaign was the general strike of March, 1913, which lasted three weeks, and brought the manufacturers to terms. The Children\\'s Dress Manufacturers\\' Association, recog-nizing the union, signed a collective agreement. The workers secured shorter working hours, from fifty-three to fifty, and one doUar increase for the week workers, to be paid in two terms. Agreements were also signed with the contractors and independent manufacturers. -Unusual dullness in the trade a£Fected the upbuilding of the Local, and in 1914 the general officers of the International started a work of reorganization. -After an energetic campaign, a general strike of the entire trade was called m January, 1916, which lasted about six weeks. The workers fought with determination in spite of great diflSculties and eventually the strike was satisfactorilv settled, due to the efforts of President Schlesinger, and the local officers. -The collective agreement signed by the Manufacturers\\' Association stdl in force, provides for 49 hours work a week; an increase in wages of one dollar for week workers; a 10 per cent increase for piece workers, and a dollar increase every year, during the three-year life of the agreement (1916-1919). -Notable is the fact that they got a minimum wage of six doUars for learners, and so the two dollars compensation which existed previous to the strike was forever banished. In addition to this, the Agreement provided double pay for overtime for week workers. -By the terms of the agreement the manufacturers were made responsible for their contractors canying out its provisions, as weU as for die workers\\' earnings in case the contractor disappeared with the workers\\' pay, as not seldom had happened previously. -By another provision a committee on immediate action was created, composed of three representatives of each side and an umpire, whose function is to act on any case in dispute arising between the employers and the union, which the officers of both sides fail to adjust. The decision is subi^ct to an appeal to a Board of Arbitration. -By negotiation in conference President Schlesinger and the local officers succeeded in winning for the workers an additional one doUar increase beginning with March 1 of this year. By the agreement they had received an increase of a doUar on January 1, 1918. -Now. at the fifth anniversarv of the first general strike of the Children\\'s Dressmakers\\' Union, we find that Local No. 50 is a great factor in the industry it controls. -Local No. 50 likewise Kas a recognized place in the progressive labor movement which it supports liberally, financially, as weU as morallv. The members of Local No. 50 point with pride to the financial assistance their union was able to give to their brothers and sisters of the cloak trade during the lockout of 1916. Their members liberaUy contributed to the Jewish war suf-As a means of being in touch with its membership, the union issues a monthly publication, \"Our Aim\\'\\' which is distributed among the members; and now that the existence of the Children\\'s Dressmakers\\' Union, Local No. 50, is assured the active members and officers are planning to initiate activities of an educational and social character — ^this is surely praiseworthy. -Financially as well as morally the local is prepared for any emergency, and we, on our side, take pnde in the fact that one more local union whose membership consists of 90 per cent women workers can size itself up with the best organized locals within our IntemationaL -Only those acquainted with conditions under which the Boston Waistmakers worked prior to the strike of 1913, will appreciate the accomplishments of Local No. 49. -Not only were the workers insulted by their masters and foremen for the slightest mistake, but they were fined in addition. The earnihgfs were as low as $3.00 to $7.00 for a 60 hours week work. There were no limitations to overtime — for which they never were paid extra. -After the two weeks\\' strike of 1913, the waistmakers succeeded in getting their employers to recognize the union, but the terms on which peace was made did not in the least satisfy the strikers; and the re^ult was that within a short time the local was almost out of existence. -Many of us still remember the doubt of some leaders, as to whether there would ever be a Waistmakers\\' Union in Boston again. They supported their opinion with the argument that the girls in Boston were incapable of practical and constructive work, and also that they were a lot of hotheaded revolutionists. -But despite these arguments the International Office in 1916 succeeded in reorganizing the local, and after a two days\\' strike in February of the same year, the union succeeded in getting the manufacturers\\' association to sign a collective agreement; so that the prophets were utterly confounded. The accomplishments of Local 49 speak for themselves. -members as high as 100 per cent. In some cases even more; and the workers are getting the best protection in the shops. Sanitary conditions have been introduced in the shops, and not only is there a limitation to working hours, but they are getting time and a half for overtime for week workers, and fifteen cents additional per hour for piece workers. But one of their greatest gains is the forty-eight hour week that the members of Local 49 are enjoying since the first of May. -The Boston Waistmakers\\' Union ranks among the best locals of our International Union and is generally respected. It is a factor in the progressive labor movement of Boston, to which it renders liberal support, material and moral. The union also enjoys a standing within the community. -The excellent conditions of the Waistmakers\\' organization induced the cutters of the trade to join the Local to have a chance to work\\' with them hand in hand for further improvement. -That the waistmakers appreciate the accomplishments of their union is proven by the fact that in celebrating the second anniversary of their organization in February, 1918, every member participated by contributing something to the exhibition arranged for the purpose. To bring the members closer together it was decided thaf its proceeds should go for a country home — a Unity Center — which should be run on a co-operative basis, where every member should have an opportunity to spend a few weeks in the hot summer months in pleasant surroundings. -Now, that the existence of the Local is assured, the active members and officers are considering the necessity of introducing educational and social activities. A course of lectures has been arranged. -But before activities of such a character can be a success, it will be necessary for the union to secure decent headquarters. The active members and officers contemplate starting a campaign among the members for a building fund. -No doubt, such a movement, if energetically carried on, will bring the desired result, because proper and convenient headquarters is essential to success for any enterprise. -Well, sisters and brothers, the result of your two years untiring efforts should encourage you to further deeds. -Being in touch with numerous locals of our International Union in many cities ^I have learned of their conditions, aspirations, and past history. I found them interest* ing and instructive and have related in the \"Ladies Garment Worker,\" certain facts of their history and struggles because L. consider it important to acquaint our big membership with the trials and tribulations of the thousands of workers employed in different trades, and the hardships they had to overcome before they succeeded in organizing a local union in their trade. -It is specially interesting to learn something of those locals that have grown up within the last few years in the waist, dress, white goods, house-dress and kimono, children\\'s dresses, petticoats, corsets and raincoats. -Our International has succeeded in penetrating into these trades, but has not yet completely organized them. -The main center for these trades is in New York. The bulk of the ladies\\' garment industry is situated in this big city. But these trades are not confined to New York City. The manufacturing of this merchandise is scattered all over the country. Of late several outside cities have become manufacturing centers of ladies\\' garments. This is especially true in the cities -west of New York, southwest and middle west. For instance, Baltimore is becoming a manufacturing center for \"light goods.\" -Considering the conditions under which the thousands of girls are there employed, we may realize the danger these cities are to our locals. In Baltimore girls are earning as much as three and four dollars weekly, and the competition is even felt by the doakmakers of that city, because the skirts which were previously made in cloak shops controlled by Local No. 4 are now made in waist and white goods shops where girls work practically for a starvation wage. -The danger from such competition is shown by the following instance: The authorities advertised throughout the coun-try, inviting men with capital to settle in this city» and the inducement they offered them was \"cheap rent\" and \"cheap labor.\" -The International is trying to organize the girls there, but it will take some time before substantial results will be accomplished. This is natural, because it is a city where the workers of this trade were never before approached, and we know that it takes time before a new city is organized. -% Like every city, Baltimore, too, has a group of young women who are idealists, and with a unique devotion they stand by their organization. Every morning and evening they are outside of the shops, telling their fellow workers that it is a disgrace, humiliating to human dignity, to work under such conditions. Late in the evening, one could see these idealists visiting their fellow workers at their homes, trying to enlighten them on their conditions. They arc assisted in their work by Miss Anna Neary, organizer for the American Federation of Labor, who is devoting her entire time to the work. -They deserve a word of encouragement. Go on with your work, my fellow workers. It will finally be crowned with success, and this will be your compensation. -The dullness in the waist and white goods trades has affected Local 43 of Worcester, but now with the assistance of the International Union that local is not only reestablishing conditions, but it has also won many improvements. -A start to organize the petticoat makers has been made in Boston, where a number of these workers became a branch of Local No. 49. -Now that the cloakmakers are almost 100 per cent, organized throughout the country, it will be the work of the International Union in the near future to complete the organizing work of the other trades. This will be necessary to retain the conditions in the organized cities. The Internationa] will also be able to devote much time to strengthening the existing organization. A good example of this work is the Joint Board of the Cloak, Ladies\\' Tailors, and Waist & White Goods Workers\\' Union recently organized by President Schlesinger. It was a very useful accomplishment and we expect that all the four locals composing it will try to niake good. -The work done by the International Union in Boston has brought good results. All the destructive elements are eliminated, and the Joint Board is now in a good condition. -It is interesting and very encouraging to note a desire on the part of the active members to broaden the activities of their unions and initiate such activities to satisfy the intellectual needs of the members . as well as the economic needs. One could notice a tendency towards co-operation. -All these activities should be encouraged by the International Union. It is needless to argfue their importance. Every intelligent worker appreciates it because it tends to utilize the energy and intelligence of our members for the benefit of their locals. -This co-operative movement is spreading among the country locals as well as the New York locals. It is too early to foretell its course and development at this moment, but if properly directed it will bring good results. -This local union has issued an interesting annual report, compiled by N. M. MinkofF, the local secretary-treasurer. The report bristles with facts and figures concerning the more important events in the life of the local in 1917. A few of these facts and figures are given here in a condensed form. -The officers concede the fact that \"only a small number of the 8,000 members attend meetings and take an active part in the affairs of the organization/\\' adding that the inactive members are nevertheless union men and women. This lack of interest is pretty general. All our locals suffer in the same way. Were the local officers not so busy with the management of local affairs it would not be a bad idea to initiate certain movements appealing to legitimate self-interest and requiring personal initiative. The members do not attend the meetings because, perhaps, they have nothing to interest them directly. Maybe they do not want to hear a repetition of set speeches. The solution for this trouble seems to be — less speech-making and more practical endeavor; entertainments and edifying socials. -Local No. 9 has six branches, one of them a women\\'s branch. Every branch is represented in the local executive board by five members, and the executive board works by six sub-committees which carry out the routine work. There is a membership committee, a consumption and relief committee, a finance committee, an organization committee, a grievance committee and a committee of delegates to the Joint Board. -The organization committee deals with complaints of members against employers, and against workers who turn from the union path. Figures given for five months in 1917 show 2,133 complaints dealt with; the amount of back pay collected was $1^24, and 175 shop meetings were held. -The committee composed of delegates to the Joint Board represents and defends the local\\'s interests at the Joint Board meetings. -An interesting department is the consumption and relief fund. The work of the committee is of k special kind. During the year the committee met twenty-four times and dealt with fifty-four cases. This fund is entirely independent of the general fund, as the money at its disposal cannot be applied toward any other purpose than for the benefit of consumptive and needy members. The work is regarded as being very important and only the most experienced and practical members are elected on the committee. -The fund derives its income from (1) an assessment of $1 a year upon every member; (2) 10 cents of the charge for constitution books; (3) all fines revert to the fund. -An instructive financial report is given for the two years and three months of its existence. Now that the benefit question is to come before the conventiop the figures , are interesting. Thus the fund had an income of $13,783.47, of which nearly $12,000 came from the d6llar assessment. Expenditures were $5,492.28, and on December 31, 1917, there was a balance of $8,291.19. Thus the fund rests on a firm foundation and has undoubtedly been a means of consolidating the local. -Thirty-two members received consump^ tion benefit or were maintained at sanitariums at the cost of the fund. The highest sum cited as having been received by one member is $250. Twenty-three members completely recovered and returned to work. Monetary relief rendered to 223 mmbers totaled $791. -The membership committee deals with all questions pertaining to admission or readmission of members. All kinds of cases come before the committee — members dropped, wishing to je-enter; sick members who cannot pay their dues and delinquent -In 1917 the committee met forty-seven times and dealt with 811 cases. Of these over 400 applicants were admitted to membership. -The report shows a loss of 1,861 members, not owing to backsliding on the part of the cloak finishers but for reasons beyond the local\\'s control. It is explained that this is due, first, to the dwindling of the number of finishers in the trade because of the increasing tendency for their hand work being done by machine. Secondly, thirty per cent, of the membership consists of women workers, and a number of them drop out of the trade to get married. There are other elements who similarly drop out of the trade year by year. This sifting process is nothing new. But when there was a constant stream of immigrants the depleted ranks were soon filled by newcomers and no loss was felt. In recent years, however, the flow of immigration has almost entirely stopped. -The matter is not so alarming as the report would have us believe. The one needful thing is that all cloak finishers working in the trade shall be affiliated with the local union. In that case the union -Another question which is almost an evil in our unions is the backward state of many members in regard to the payment of their dues. At the end of 1917 Local No. 9 had only 1,412 members in good standing, that is, in arrears of dues less than thirteen weeks. All the rest were in arrears from fourteen to fifty-two weeks. The total sum of their indebtedness exceeded the amount of $23,000 — quite a fortune for such a local union. -A good many of these backward members might be excused. Slackness and the high cost of living made it hard for them to pay their dues more regularly. But a large number of members are simply negligent, or they think, perhaps, that they will apply to the membership committee requesting that their debt be wiped off. -The best remedy for this evil would be to have the member^ pay twice a year, after working two full weeks in the new seasons. Each member would have to pay about $5 to $6 in one lump sum which cannot ruin anybody. The union serves the worker and his family much better than does the landlord or the storekeeper; and when the members will get the habit of thinking that the union is not a charity institution this evil will disappear. -Owing to rumors that at the next convention in Boston a demand by some delegates will be made for revoking the charter of Local No. 11, Cloakmakers of Brownsville, and merging its membership with some of the New York locals, the Executive Board of Local No. 11 considered it advisable to issue a report to the convention showing the futility of such a step. The report dwells on certain historical facts of the local\\'s existence, its struggles and achievements, and at the request of its officers a brief survey of the report is placed herewith. -The report is interesting in its description of the rise of Brownsville, N. Y., to be practically a populous industrial city. Its former bogs and marshes and general aspect of ugliness and discomfort have g^ven rise to decent buildings, busy streets and a teeming -population. This now well inhabited section of Brooklyn has similarly become a center for the less pretentious manufacturers of women\\'s garments and hence almost all the New York locals of the International Union have well-organized branches there. Local No. 11 is one of the oldest, if not the oldest, labor union in the ladies\\' garment industry in that part of Greater New York. -the union twenty years ago. According to the report the union then bore the name of \"Local No. 4.\" But as the International was not organized until 1900 this Brownsville Cloakmakers\\' Union must have been a branch of the then \"Brotherhood of Cloakmakers.\" -The first Brownsville Cloakmakers\\' Union shared the fate of all similar organizations of that period. It struggled for several years and finally disappeared from the scene. In 1904, when the Williamsburg bridge was opened for traffic and cars began to run across, and the number of contractors and their employees multiplied exceedingly, the need of organization to check the practice of sweating became very pressing. It was then that the present Local No. 11 was organized with the help ofthe newly organized International Union. -In spite of many ups and downs the local stood its ground. We read in the report that, while most of the New York locals existed only on paper, Local No. 11 was \"alive and kicking.\" And when preparations were made for the historic general strike of 1910 Local No. 11 was completely organized and ready to join the fight. During the strike Local No. 11 so thoroughly controlled the situation that not a trace of scab work was made there. According to the report the local is proud of the fact that between the years of 1904 and 1910 it was a union in the real sense. This was due to the fact that the membership regarded the organization as peculiarly their own, created and built up by their own efforts. The fact that Brownsville is n9t a nest of non-unionism and scab labor for our •trades, like parts of New Jersey, is due to the existence of Local No. 11 and its struggles for uplifting and ennobling the workers\\' lives. -The report describes the antagonism between the inside and outside workers and how the question came to be an absorbing topic in the Cloakmakers\\' Union. Soon after the general strike Local No. 11 became affiliated with the Joint Board of New York, and coming in contact with new men, whose main function was to stop the work for one reason or another, the workers of Brownsville at first regarded the Joint Board office as the protector of the New York workers, -and a hostile sentiment was generated between them and the then officers of the Joint Board. But the more intelligent and de-voted element of Local No. 11 stepped into the threatened breach and sought to clarify the situation and conciliate the membership and they succeeded in bringing about a change for the better. -Almost all the cloakmakers of Brownsville i work for contractors and sub-manufacturers. ] Thus Local No. 11 inevitably became the champion of these workers in all their dealings with the employers. The Cloakmakers\\' Union has been almost entirely engrossed with the interests of the inside workers, and so it devolved upon Local No. 11 to care for the outside workers of Brownsville, and the local succeeded in bringing the shops of the district under no smaller measure of control than that exercised by the union over the shops in New York. -Local No. 11 consists of two classes of members — ^a young element, intelligent and alert, scattered in the New York shops, and an older, weaker and toil-worn element working exclusively in Brownsville. The latter, according to the report, could not even be expelled from that section by force. They are firmly settled and habituated in Brownsville. The shops they work in are near to their homes, thus saving them the time and trouble of dressing up and taking car trips and lunches in restaurants. Going to and from New York daily to work would be quite an ordeal for them. They take this trip only on festive occasions or to meet a convivial family party. Referring to the demand for merging Local No. 11 with the New York locals the report says: -They who think that this element of Brownsville members can be easily assimilated with some local in New York are mistaken. Seventy-five per cent of our membership are so firmly rooted in Brownsville that they will never fit into another local without showing the bulging patchwork. It would be inconvenient tor both sides. -The opponents of the idea of smaller locals, who cite Local No. 11 and the erstwhile Presscrs\\' Local No. 68 of Brownsville as an argument in their favor should note this passage in the report of Local No. 11: -We want to point to a fact that teaches us a lesson. There was in Brownsville a pressers\\' local of several hundred members. Then a convention decided that the local should be dissolved and merged with Local No. 35, Pressers\\' Union of New York. Did not this seem a victory for the latter local? * * ♦ But ask Local No. 35 and -they will tell you from their experience that to control that small number of Brownsville pressers cost double the amount of the income received and not less trouble and unpleasantness. The Brownsville pressers, on the other hand, will tell you that their affiliation with Local No. 35 has made no material or moral change in their condition; and it is not slanderous to say that both sides are dissatisfied. But when one talks of the advisability of dissolving such a local as ours we feel that it is necessary to have our experience and knowledge of the situation to be able to judge rightly, so as to avoid acting rashly. -As to the practical activity of Local No. 11 the report describes the internal life and idealism of its members, which should make their unsympathetic critics pause to think. Here are a few facts: -Local No. 11 was foremost in the enterprise of erecting the handsome Brownsville Labor Lyceum. The local gave the first donation of $1,000 for this purpose and is now represented in the various committees that manage and maintain this labor temple. -Local No. 11 takes an active part morally and financially in all progressive movements. The Socialist victories in Brownsville in the recent elections are, in large measure, due to the activity of the Brownsville cloakmakers. -Even before Local No. 11 was connected with the New York locals, it had distinguished itself in a strike against the firm of John Bonwit in 1907. President Schlesinger of the International Union had led that strike. -Local No. 11 does not pretend to be the best local, but it claims to have contributed to the organizing work in Brownsville at all times. -At the time when the scab herder Sulkess attempted an invasion of the Brownsville shops, the cloakmakers of Brownsville gave the disrupters such a hot reception that in a few days they were bundled out of that locality bag and baggage and took good care not to show their faces again. -In the recent trouble with a group of leaders of the cloak operators of Local No. 1 the Brownsvilleans likewise showed the stuff they are made of. Boldly they informed the group of over 100 members of -that local working in their shops: \"Either you will belong together with us to the Joint Board, or you must go. ♦ * * We will not stand for two unions in one shop,\" and in Brownsville the trouble was over in three or four weeks. -We have so far referred to the historical facts contained in the report, and now a word as to the report itself: -The report (published in Yiddish) marshalls the facts and arguments in a manner much to the point, dispassionately and without bombast. Its cold, iron logic is irresistible. Those who will read it with sympathetic attention will get a different picture of Local No. 11 than has been current in some circles. -And while we are more interested in its historical side we should not forget that the object of the report is to show in its own concluding words: -\"That Local No. 11, exercising a healthy influence over its membership, must by no means be dissolved, because it is a great force in helping to bring about week work in the Brownsville shops. * * * If dissolution is resolved on it will cause demoralization among the membership of Local No. 11. This will react injuriously on the Brownsville shops and may prevent the realization of the week work system. Like an ill wind it will blow no one any good. -\"We who know the true state of affairs in Brownsville safely assert that dissolving Local No. 11 means dissolving the union in Brownsville. However easy and deliberate the operation, it will leave a raw wound on the body of our union. -In the last few years we have had pretty gbod seasons. Embroidery on garments was in fashion in the waist, dress and cloak trades. We have succeeded in organizing a strong union of Bonnaz machine embroiderers. By a general strike Local No. 66 won week work and a minimum scale of wages. Today our second class operators receive a minimum of $30 a week, and first-class operators $35. Of course, we. have prevented the employers from turning the minimum into a maximum scale, for the more nimble and skilled operators earn from $37 to $40 a week. We have complete control over the workers in the shops and our people are paid for ten legal holidays. Thus, upon the surface, we have little to complain of. But only 45 per cent of our trade is organized. We still have a considerable number of non-union shops, which by their cut-throat competition constitute a standing menace to our union and our trade, and for this reason: -Bonnaz machine embroidering is a highly skilled trade. One cannot become an operator in a day. In spite of the so-called schools, which have lately started turning out operators, the number of workers in the trade is still limited. And when embroidery is in style there is enough work for the union shops as well as for the non-union shops. -It happens very often that two employers are after one worker, and to give our union shops the preference we decided that our members shall not work in any non-union shop. Not one employer was thereby compelled to settle with the union. They had no alterative, as they could not get any non-union workers. -But when the slack time sets in, it stimulates the evil of competition. The non-union contractors start getting busy, hustling around the waist and dress shops, underbidding the union contractors, and snatching the few bundles out of their hands. They are able to do so because they work fifty and fifty-four hours a week mstead of fortyeight hours enforced in the union shops, and they cut down the wages of their semislaves, while in the union shops a reduction -in wages during the slack time is prohibited. It is very annoying that at a time when our people start dividing the scanty work among themselves, the non-union shops advertise for help. Now when our members go about idle it is impossible for them to resist the offer of a temporary job in a non-union shop at a ridiculously low wage. Aside from these non-union advertisements being a constant temptation to our members, the non-union contractors have until now kept their workers from joining the union by promising them steady workin view of the fact that in all the nonunion shops mostly American women are employed, the situation can be easily imagined. Nevertheless we are continually storming the non-union fortresses and are making good progress. But we can only secure our position with the assistance of the International Union and the Waist and Dressmakers Local No. 25. They will surely do their duty by a fellow local union. -Local No. 66 is proud of being a branch of the overspreadmg tree of our International Union, and the struggles of the Cloakmakers and Waist and Dressmakers have always been our struggles. So our request to them is as follows: -It should be remembered that the Bonnaz machine embroidery trade is entirely in the hands of contractors who work the embroidery into the garments outside of the garment factories. They are practically the outside contractors of the waist, dress and cloak manufacturers. -Therefore our members feel that just as Local No. 25 and the Joint Board of the Cloakmakers\\' Union are interested in having the outside contractors of their trade registered and run as union shops, and complying with union standards, so they must cooperate with us in controlling the non-union embroidery contractors, who take the work out of their union shops. -In this not only Bonnaz machine embroidery is concerned but also hand embroidery. Our International Union is proud of having abolished home work in the cloak and dress trades. But not less than 1,500 women workers are employed by non-union con-At the last convention we called for a decision requiring the cloak, suit, skirt and dress manufacturers to assume responsibility for the labor standards of their embroidery contractors, and also that the work shall be given out to union contractors. -The convention referred our request* to the General Executive Board for action. We hope that the next convention in Boston will positively decide that the manufacturers\\' association in the cloak, suit and dress trades shall be officially called upon ta give out the embroidery work to union contractors only. -In the meantime the business agents of Lecal No. 25 can help us to bring this improvement into life regardless of the attitude of the associations. Where the Cloakmakers\\' and Waistmakers\\' Unions exercise control over the shops they can help us very much. -The workers in the shops of Local No. 25 on their part can help us by refusing to do the work embroidered in scab shops. As principled, loyal union workers they cannot really act otherwise. The work comes to our shops direct from the cutting rooms. We shall gladly furnish them with the names of the embroidery shops involved in strikes and also the names of the dress shops for whom this work is made. -When this will be accomplished, our Local No. 66 will be enabled to continue the good work for the good and welfare of the workers in the trade and the International Union in general. -Brother Sigmund Haiman writes: Things are pretty lively in Worcester at present. Since I arrived in Worcester shop meetings have been held daily with the different shops, and workers are joining the union and pledging their help to organize all the shops of dresses, waists and white gpods. -Three shops have signed agreements with the union, and have reduced the working hours from 54 and 56 to 49 hours per week. The cutters (men) were working two hours each week more than the women. Now all work 49 hours. -The increases for week workers range from $1.00 to $4.00 per week. Piece workers have received increases from 15 per cent to 50 per cent; the average increase is about 25 per cent tA schedule has been installed in all waist shops for settlements of piece prices, which gives the workers an opportunity to know what they have to demand for certain work, while until now the^ employers alone fixed the prices. -Price committees and chairladies have been elected in these shops, and they will do their utmost to protect the increases. -The Executive Board and the active members of Worcester are very busy trymg to organize the other few shops that have not signed agreements with the union yet. These shops, too, have reduced the working hours from 56 and 58 to 49 hours, and have gfiven increases to their workers, so that they should not go to the meetings of the union, but it is very doubtful whether this will keep the workers from the union. -All the members are determined to go after the unorganized workers in these shops and persuade them not to be fooled by such promises, but join the union and make proper demands. -One of these manufacturers called in the Jewish girls and offered them increases, asking them not to tell it to the Gentile gfirls; but the idea was scouted. -The last members\\' meeting was well attended and 20 girls pledged their services to the Organization Committee. They promised to spend every evening in going to the houses of the unorganized, and inducing -\"The decision of the thirteenth convention to amalgamate Locals No. 30, Alteration Tailors; Local No. 38, Ladies\\' Tailors and Dressmakers, and Local No. 65, Ladies\\' Tailors and Dressmakers of Brooklyn, was carried out soon after the convention. -\"Th e General Executive Board at the joint conference proposed that the Private Dressmakers, a branch of the Waist and Dressmakers, Local No. 25, should be a separate local and have the jurisdiction over the private dressmakers and take care of the organization work in their own trade. The proposition was agreed to, and the International Union issued them a charter as Local No. 90. The amalgamated union of the -\"By a ruling of Vice Presidents Lefkovits, Wander and Ninfo, Bro. Markis was elected secretary, while the writer of this was re-, tained as clerk to the secretary. -\"At the amalgamation Local No. 30 brought into the treasury $190 and Local No. 38, $424. Local No. 65 was in debt, which we paid. Thus the new union started with a capital of $614. -\"It took some time to harmonize and weld together the various elements. In this Vice President Lefkovits, who was appointed by the International to organize the trade, helped a great deal. Not until certain misunderstandings were removed did the organization work begin in earnest, and then everyone assisted Bro. Lefkovits in the best possible way. -\"Plans were formed to call a general strike in the fall season of 1917, and we worked untiringly toward that end. We should not forget the demoralization prevailing among the workers. They had lost their faith in all efforts to improve conditions in spite of their unbearable sufferings at the hands of the employers. -\"Gradually Bro. Lefkovits succeeded in imbuing them with the conviction that all doubt and mistrust must give way to renewed life and work for a clean and true union. Three mass meetings, then held, encouraged our work of raising the workers out of a sort of bondage, and little by little they joined the ranks of the union. -\"The agitation for a general strike was welcomed with enthusiasm. There was no other solution. Our leaders tried to avoid a strike. But while some manufacturers intimated their willingness to meet the demands of the union the majority of the employers ignored the agitation. -\"The general strike was called on September 22, 1917, and the workers warmly responded to the call and left the shops. Many firms settled immediately. Only a small number of employers remained stubborn. At the end of two weeks all the firms settled with the union. It was remarkable that not a single arrest was made, so well and orderly was the strike conducted. -\"The concessions won included a fortyeight hour week; a minimum wage of $30 for first-class workers and a minimum of $26 for second-class workers; an increase of 20 per cent for those receiving a wage above this scale; time and a half for overtime; two legal holidays; a week\\'s trial, and minor improvements. , -\"The strike was successful, even though it did not extend to the entire trade. The alteration tailors were unmoved, except the workers of the Franklin Simon Company, J. M. Gidding and several East Side stores. -\"The prestige of the union grew and there was general satisfaction at what had been accomplished. The union amassed a treasury of several thousand dollars in a few weeks and all went smoothly under the supervision of Vice President S. Lefkovits, for whom we all have a high regard. -\"But our employers cannot acquire the habit of living in peace with the union. It seems that a certain firm, Milgrim Bros., employing some 200 ladies\\' tailors, intrigued against the union, in having four disloyal workers come to work on -Saturday afternoons and Sundays. The violation was quickly discovered and the union decided that two of the guilty workers should leave the shop and two should be fined $50 each. The firm denied knowledge of the fact and insisted on these people returning to work, but the union could not concede the jpoint. -\"As it was the end of the season the firm seemed to have planned an attack on the organization. Two shop chairmen were discharged, followed by a lockout of all the -\"The shop was at one time considered a hard one to tackle; but this time all the workers proved loyal to the cause. -\"The strike lasted eight weeks. The firm resorted to every expedient in trying to lure the workers back. One of these was the provision of kitchen and sleeping arrangements; another was the employment of eighteen hired guards. It may be safely asserted that the strike cost the firm $40,000. -\"Although the strike had to be abandoned because of inadequate fininces, and after all donations from our own members, from the International Union, from the New York Joint Board of the Cloakmakers\\' Union and from other locals had been exhausted, our local union retained its strength and prestige.\\' When the spring season started the union was in full vigor again. A number of shop strikes were settled in a few days and others in a few hours. So far, we have not lost control over a single shop. We have under union control all the shops unionized in the last strike, with exception of Milgrim Bros. The receipts and expenditures for 1917 show our satisfactory financial standing. They were: Receipts, $12,192.89; expenditures, $11,522.43. -\"We are grateful, indeed, to our International Union; the Joint Board of the Cloakmakers; Locals 3. 9, 10, 17, 23, 25, 35, 41, 64 and Local^ No. 1, Capmakers* Union for their financial support in the Milgrim strike. Special thanks are due to the Furriers\\' Joint Board of New York, Locals 1, 5, 10, 15 of the International Fur Workers\\' Union, for calling out on sympathy strike their members employed in shops doing work for Milgrim Bros, and paying them strike benefit for six weeks.\" -\"Several years ago a movement had been started to amalgamate the former Local No. 38, Ladies\\' Tailors, and Local No. 3, Sample Makers and Piece Tailors. In the general cloak strike of 1916 the necessity for this was clearly demonstrated. We all remember how the Cloakmakers* Joint Board tried to induce the Ladies* Tailors, who were making samples for the cloak houses in strike, to join the strikers. -\"It is equally well known that as soon as the sample season comes to an end in the cloak trade the sample makers of Local No. 3 come to work in the Ladies* Tailors\\' shops, -while the Ladies\\' Tailors at the end of their season go to work in the cloak shops. Transfer cards are demanded by the respective unions in control of the shops and this causes friction among the locals. -\"Again, a sample maker or a ladies\\' tailor, after the season in his own trade is over often permits himself to accept a lower wage in the other trade, because he con« siders that a side line, and the interest of the worker in the other trade does not concern him. The active spirits at the head of both locals perceived this and were willing to join forces. To facilitate the process President Schlesinger advised the formation of a trades council to meet and discuss matters of common interest, so as to make the fusion of forces a success upon the convention stamping the project with approval. -\"This Trades Council has been meeting weekly. At a mass meeting of the membership of both locals the establishment of the Trades Council and the ultimate amalgamation of the two locals was ratified. -\"It is to be hoped that the general officers and delegates to the fourteenth convention in Boston will realize the necessity of reorgafiizing both locals under one charter.\" -This column is for letters and short articles of members and readers on carrent trade and labor topics.

Union activity cannot be shared in by all, and the unity of our organization is merely mechanical, kept up by artificial means. -If it were the case that smaller locals or branches have the aforementioned qualities, Locals Nos. 11, 3 and 64 would be model organizations and their existence as• sured. But those locals have no more fraternity, solidarity and activity, perhaps less, than Locals 1, 9, 23 and 35. The cloak pressers of New York once had two locals — Nos. 35 and 68. Did the members of Local 68 fare better than at present ? By no means. There was friction, and, to some extent, competition. -Not once have the sample makers of Local No. 3 regretted their separation from Local No. 9. The condition of the sample makers has not improved as a result of their having a separate union. The members do not feel such nearness to one another as the finishers, even though the finishers\\' local consists of almost 8,000 members, and their expenses have increased too. -I am surprised at the writer of the article in question. He surely knows the cry of the operators, in the recent dispute with Local No. 1, namely, \"Abolish the several locals in one and the same trade and city.\" It was this jurisdiction question that brought about the reorganization of Local No. 1. Now this writer comes and says that the only remedy is — smaller locals. Instead of centralization he advocates the idea of splitting up and breaking the strength of our organization. Imagine, for instance, that the 8,000 operators would be split up into sixteen locals. Similarly with the finishers and other locals. Now, naturally, when we talk in the name of democracy we must be so far democratic as to give every local autonomy, so that each local would have an executive board and by-laws according to its desire. The International Union cannot establish uniformity of thought. Can you imagine a worse situation? For instance, there will be in one shop twenty operators of ten different lo-cals, four pressers of four locals, five finishers of five locals, and everyone will recognize his executive board only. One executive board will decide one way and another board the other way. This, instead of uniting the workers in the shop, will divide them and create new barriers between one worker and another. -Let us now consider the financial side, which plays a large part in our organization. Does the writer know that all small locals, having even more than 500 members, barely exist? Not once are they anxious about their next month\\'s office rent. Even if their weekly dues should be 25 cents it would not pay, because according to the plan of small locals every local would have an executive board, financial secretary and other officers, and considerable expenses. -If the motive for the new plan has arisen because of the recent dispute with Local No. 1, is it because a big local is sometimes tempted to overstep the bounds of organization, and to discipline a local of this kind great courage, responsibility and effort are needed, therefore it is proposed to divide our strength into small locals to make it easier to control, and, if necessary, to discipline them? — if this is the motive, then it is in the first place cowardly. Secondly, what would happen if ten locals of finishers join and raise the cry, for example, that no finishing should be made by machine, or some similar unrealizable demand, and threaten to withdraw from the Toint Board if their demand be not conceaed? Then, instead of disciplining one local, the International would have to reorganize ten locals. Does not this show^ that the scheme of small locals is illogical? -If the idea is to establish a good control over the members, then instead of splitting them up into small groups it would be more advisable to do away with the present separate locals, separate offices, separate staffs and separate expenses, the total amount of which must be enormous. Instead of this, the membership department and finance department of all the workers in their particular branch of industry should be concentrated in one central body under the supervision of the Joint Board. This system would effect economy and efficiency. It would pay to engage a financial expert to install a modern system of finance and save much money. It would give us a possi-bility to introduce uniform dues, one membership committee, one grievance committee and one appeal committee on which all branches of trade would be represented; and instead of locals there would be trade branches. Every branch would have its executive board and elected representatives in the Joint Board. The branches would take up only trade questions. As for the financial and membership questions — these would be dealt with by the Joint Board. -This would give the Joint Board and the International full control over every local and would make it impossible for any local, for the sake of personal caprices, to dream of dictating terms to the central body or misuse the members\\' money in a desire to break up the union, as was the case recently with a group of irresponsible persons. The motto of our union is unity, integrity and not the splitting up of forces. -The first thing to be noticed in the ^bove correspondence is that Brother Cook has not read the articles on this subject in the February and March issues of the Ladies\\' Garment Worker; so that he has not a clear view of the proposition and of the indisputable causes making smaller locals an urgent necessity. -It is strange that Brother Cook, an active member of his local, should have overlooked this matter. We find that many local officers and active members are in the same boat, being either too busy or negligent to follow their own trade press and keep well posted on important general matters within the organization. -There are certain evils due directly to the unnatural size of some of our locals, namely, indifference and aloofness of the lar^e mass of members from the life and activity of their locals, the necessity of organizing and reorganizing every season and want of earnestness generally. Large locals are not a normal and regular thing in an organization. Where the local consists of thousands of members, there is no earthly chance for theni to get the floor and express their opinions at members\\' meetings. Many of our members do not always want to hear what other people have to say; they sometimes would like other people to hear what they have to say. At large meetings this is impossible, and for that reason they stay away. -Brother Cook argues that the present smaller locals do not show the qualities of friendship and solidarity and activity which they are supposed to have because they are smaller. He cites for example Locals Nos. 11, 3 and 64. -In regard to Local No. 11, Brownsville Cloakmakers, the local has issued a report and review of its history to the convention, claiming to have developed certain quali-ties and to have established a sound control^ over the Brownsville shops because of its smaller size, while if it had been swallowed up in the ocean of a big local there would have disappeared all the peculiar individuality and character of the local\\'s useful career. -As to the Locals Nos. 3 and 64, it must be borne in mind that these locals were established on the same principle as the big locals, namely, \"separate kingdoms,\" as Brother Cook calls them. They are not founded on that principle, which would give every member an equal opportunity to find expression, but rather on a kind of oligarchy or bureaucracy ruled from above by diplomats and officials. The success of such an organization depends on the ability and talent of the diplomats and officials and not on the will and enthusiasm and co-operation of the members. That is the chief trouble in all our locals, large or small. -My idea of smaller locals is based on the rule of the people, where the officers carry out the expressed will of the people and not, as they do at present, leaving everything to the officers. I mean locals which should gradually rise to a condition where at least fifty or sixty per cent, of the members should be capable of serving in official capacities. Now, we have not the human material from which to select officers. I agree that small locals founded on the principle of separate management and expenses must lead a poor existence. -Brother Cook paints a black picture of 8,000 operators split up into sixteen locals, each having compjete autonomy and its own by-laws and their executive boards and members in the shops being continually at loggerheads. But this shows that he has not even read my article but^only the heading: \"A Local Union Should Consist of Not More Than 500 Members.\" Discussing the question whether the smaller locals will maintain harmony among themselves and not seek to foster separate interests and separate policies, my article reads: -\"The duties and functions of the locals, the executive boards and Joint Boards would remain the same: namely, to improve conditions and strengthen the union. There is no need to change the present form of local autonomy. Every local should be free in strictly local matters, yet closely allied with the rest of the locals in the same branch of trade through a Joint Board, in all matters affecting the general interest. So far as the policy of the union, minimum scale of wages, maximum number of working hours, general strikes and other questions pertaining to the entire industry are concerned — these matters should remain, as at present, in the hands of the Joint Boards and the International Union.\" -Well informed union people know that by-laws must be in accord with the International constitution; that in an organization there can not be license to override the will of the majority, which is sometimes -It does not follow that twenty operators of ten smaller locals will work in one shop. That is purely imaginary, and even if they should it does not follow that they will not rather go hand in hand in their interest with their local executives and work in harmony rather than develop friction and conflict. -I have a diflFercnt picture in my mind; namely, that all trade questions, strikes, complaints and settlements will be taken care of by the Joint Board and the International; that the smaller locals need no separate officers and separate financial systems. Our Philadelphia Joint Board locals have one office and one financial system. There is no reason why the smaller locals in one industry should not have one membership committee, one grievance committee and one appeal committee. But the main aim of the smaller locals will be to attract the members to their meetings, by encouraging them to take the floor and express their views and by interesting them in responsible work for their interest. At present they are indifferent because they have nothing more to do than pay their dues and listen to a dry report. Such matters as the present high cost of living, cooperative buying for the members and their families, benefit features, educational clubs, local libraries and amusements can become -The work of a union is to educate its members not through outside educational influences but through union activity within, which would make them into better fighters in the economic struggle. At present this work is being done by a very few people; hence it is necessary to control the members from above, and we have not yet discovered the most efficient system of control. Many members continually slip away from all control. In smaller locals, properly organized, this control can be automatic — ^in every member\\'s heart. -The plan of smaller locals aims at uniting the locals in a strong bond of solidarity ^rather than to separate them. Experience shows that locals are apt to imitate one another in positive undertakings for the comnlon good, and some locals even unite for a common purpose to economize in expenditure, as, for instance, Locals Nos. 35, 9 and 23 are united in caring for the health of their membership through the Joint Board of Sanitary Control. -Above all, let no one compare small locals where the trade is organized to small locals where the trade is not organized, where the locals are engaged in a struggle for existence and cannot devote^ themselves to any kind of educational activity. Smaller locals would bring more solidarity between them, while at present every big local is a sort of \"independent kingdom.\" -contains editorials on the most important Problems in the Ladies\\' Garment Industry and the labor movement in general -Monthly Reports of the Activities of the Different Local Unions of the I.

To add another study to the already long list of contributions on the subject can be justified only on the ground that it furnishes facts which other studies have ignored. This we believe we have done. As to whether the information we have gathered will be of any service in throwing light on the subject of industrial hygiene must be determined by those who have labored for years in this field. -Lacking official authority to make the study, the work was frequently delayed in trying to gain the consent of employers to permit a survey of their establishments. In not a few instances this was refused. As to the employees, it is gratifying to be able to state that with hardly a single exception, they cheerfully submitted, not only to an examination, but also to a searching inquiry into every detail of their lives. -We welcome this opportunity to express to Mr. Frederick L. Hoffman, of the Prudential Insurance Company, our thanks for suggestions in making up the inquiry blanks; for assistance furnished in the analysis of the data and for the great interest he has shown throughout in the study. -To Dr. Kaufman, of the Phipps Institute Staff, we wish also to express our thanks for assistance rendered in making some of the physical examinations, and to Mr. Carol Aronovici for the preparation of charts. -The present contribution is an attempt to picture the industrial life of workers engaged in an occupation in which deterioration in health is a gradual process, as distinguished from occupations in which the chief danger is mineral poisoning or a traumatic accident. During the past few years there has been a great deal of work done having for its object the minimizing of accidents. In many instances the necessity of protecting working-people in this regard has been made obligatory by law. -In addition a number of investigations have been made, some under the auspices of the government, others by unofficial organizations, as to the condition of factories and working-places in general. This, too, has had a good effect in improving many existing evils, although the ideal is very far from having been reached. As a result of these studies made regarding industrial hygiene, and which have been for the most part inaugurated by the sociologist, the subject is becoming more and more important from the purely medical aspect. -Large business concerns are beginning also to appreciate the importance not only of maintaining the health of their employees, but of rejecting those who are physically unfit. -The major portion of our knowledge regarding the effect of certain occupations is based on mortality returns. Thus if a certain number of deaths from a given disease is recorded as being so many per thousand, and this is in excess of the general death-rate per thousand, it is assumed that this particular occupation exerts a harmful effect on the worker. -In some instances this conclusion admits of no doubt. In others — and this includes a large number of occupations — there are so many contributing factors outside of the employment itself that the occupation can be responsible only partially., -Another defect in our present knowledge regarding the effect of a given employment on the health of the worker lies in the fact that no distinction is made as to the exact nature of work done. Almost invariably the employ-ment is put down under a general heading, as, for instance, potter, hatter, tailor, etc. The use of such a comprehensive term should be avoided, if possible, as each of these occupations has many departments, between several of which no common characteristic can be said to exist. Thus in the pottery industry there is no relationship between the making of articles from potters\\' clay and their ornamentation by painting and gilding. Among hatters there is a wide difference in the character of the work performed in preparing the felt and the molding of it into shape: in the former instance dust is a factor to be reckoned with; in the latter, the work is done in a room saturated with steam. In the garment-making industry there are seven or eight different trade processes, several of which tend to exert a different effect on the workers. -The following illustration will serve to indicate one of the weaknesses of mortality statistics as furnishing a reliable criterion as to the exact effect of an occupation. The manufacture of hats has been classed among the dusty trades, and one in which the mortality from tuberculosis is unusually high. This has been ascribed to the exposure of the worker to organic dust. It is, therefore, interesting to note that the majority of the hatters who have visited the Phipps Institute Dispensary have been employed in the molding-room, and as far removed as possible from dust. And other instances might be cited to show that what seems to be the factor at fault really plays no part at all. -Then, too, the tendency in the past has been to study the effect of a given industry from the viewpoint of the occupation itself. While it is true that there has been an appreciation of the fact that in many occupations the home surroundings and habits of the work-people, poverty, age, and s.ex played a part in the deterioration of health, little or no attempt has been made to correlate these various factors. -It was a realization of these facts that led to the present study, the object of which has been to obtain as complete a picture as possible of a representative group of garment-workers. Not only was the working-place to be investigated, but also the worker, and as regards the latter, every effort was made to obtain every possible piece of information that would throw any light on the problem. -From the standpoint of preventive medicine, a clear definition as to what diseases should be called occupational is not essential. Preventive medicine concerns itself equally with the ill effects upon the health of workers, whether these effects result from certain industrial poisons or from certain entirely avoidable unsanitary conditions. In fact, from the standpoint of the conservation of the health of the worker, the alleviation of the condi-tions which do not cause specific diseases, but which have as their inevitable consequence the diminished bodily resistance, with greatly increased susceptibility to disease of all kinds, is of even greater importance than the dealing with the causes of specific industrial diseases — more important because it affects greater numbers. The number of workers employed in trades recognized as dangerous is but a small fraction of the vast number who are employed in the enormous variety of industries which in themselves are innocuous, but which undermine the health of the operators by the entirely avoidable unsanitary conditions under which they work, and the standards of production from the point of view of speed that prevail in certain industries. -SOURCES OF INFORMATION. It should be possible to meet the first requirement in a study of the mortality and morbidity rates of persons employed in the clothing industry from the experience data of — -5. Local and national census reports on occupational mortality. The reports of insurance companies and fraternal societies, failing to -tabulate their morbidity and mortality experience data according to occupations, a study of several hundred records of representative companies was made and proved the inaccessibility of these data, at least for the purposes of this study. -Even the mutual benefit societies to be found in a few of the factories investigated kept no records of the sickness represented among their beneficiaries, but only of the period and the amount paid out. With an adequate system of record keeping, this source of information, properly organized, should prove invaluable in a study of the health aspects or morbidity experience of a given industry. The records of The Workmen\\'s Circle, a fraternal organization representing the largest organized group of garment workers in America, were, with the exception of the tuberculosis sanatorium, which is tabulated separately, practically valueless. -The second source of information should be from the experience of agencies dealing directly with sickness and its prevention. -The United States is exceptional among the countries of the civilized world in that there is no national system of vital statistics. -The chief burden of filing certificates of death is imposed upon the undertaker, and it is hardly to be expected that, since no provision for fees has been made for them, as in the case of physicians and midwives in certain districts, the sense of responsibility and proper appreciation of the data provided will obtain. -The certificates of death constitute the basic schedule for the collection of mortality statistics, and upon the uniformity and precision with which the several items are filled out depends largely the comparability of the resulting data. -Up to 1910 the occupation was given no space in the death records used in Philadelphia, and even in the recently developed register the space invariably has been left open. -The importance of recording this information in available form has been recognized recently, and a new card-punching machine has been installed in the Department of Vital Statistics. This promises in the future to make this information readily accessible. -In the Department of Medical Inspection, moreover, but scant attention, up to the first of this year, was paid to the proper recording of the occupations in the tuberculosis report cards, and in the annual reports no classification of occupations or industries was made. In the recently developed records, however, this point has been adjusted and promises to obviate the present difficulty by establishing a source of comparative data. -The same situation is to be found in hospitals and dispensaries, and even where the occupation has been noted, it is usually too inaccurate to be of any value. -It must be remembered that, with the exception of phosphorus, lead, and mercury poisoning, few investigations of value have been made in this country into the vast question of industrial poisoning and occupational disease. That careful study carried out by competent authorities is urgently needed can be seen from the long list of physical defects to be found every day in our industries. -In England, where reports of certain occupations are compulsory, it is possible to secure, for example, reliable data as to the number of cases of lead poisoning. -The same facilities are afforded by the statistics of the \" German Industrial Insurance Institutes,\" which furnish not only the number of deaths from various causes, but also the number of cases treated, together with the age period and duration of the disease. Similar facts should be collected -in this country. This is all the more important when it is remembered that, even with the most complete statistics, it is extremely difficult to determine all the factors which influence the health and longevity of operatives. -Any initial study, therefore, undertaken in this country, purporting to establish this point, must bear the mark of the limitations already referred to. -This emphasizes the fact that not sufficient attention is given in medical schools to the effect of occupation on health. While the student is taught to inquire as to the occupation of the patient, the information is recorded, as a rule, in such a general way as to be useless. True, it cannot be expected that physicians should be acquainted with the infinite complexity of industrial processes, yet the comparatively small amount of time that would be required to obtain more detailed information as to the patient\\'s occupation would fully repay them. -Judging from the English statistics of illness, we must conclude that at all times in the United States about 3,000,000 persons are seriously ill, of whom about 500,000 are consumptives. Fully half of this illness is preventable. The lengthening and strengthening of life can be secured through medical investigation and practice, school and factory hygiene, restriction of labor of women and children, the education of the public in both public and private hygiene, and through improving the efficiency of our municipal, state, and national health service. -It is only recently that all the factors influencing health have been considered in relation to the individual, and, as far as we know, the Phipps Institute was the first to appreciate the importance of these data, recording complete information concerning the living and housing conditions and work process of each patient. -This study includes nearly 1000 workers examined indiscriminately while at work. Of these, 743 were studied intensively — 402 males and 341 females. It seemed best, in order to insure a representative group of workers throughout the city, to use the factory as the focal point, and for this purpose three distinct types were selected, namely, the modern standardized factory, showing the best conditions; the contracting factory, where average conditions prevail, and the sweat-shop, or lowest grade of factory, showing the worst conditions. -The places of employment of these workers were studied separately, with a view to ascertaining, in so far as possible, each factor and its bearing upon the health of the individual. -One of the most important factors in determining the physical conditions of workers as related to their occupation is to be found in the occupational history of the individual. The mere presence of an individual in a particular occupation, and the facts relating to his physical condition as revealed by a careful medical examination, are not conclusive proof of the influence of that occupation upon the physique, even though all other conditions surrounding the worker remain the same. Special emphasis was, therefore, placed upon the trade history of each worker. -A valuable contribution to the health history of industrial workers will eventually be derived from the records of school medical inspection, but this system is not, at the present time, far enough developed to contribute toward the physical histories of industrial workers. -Housing workers, on the other hand, have been devoting themselves to the structural conditions of buildings, but have failed to give us any basis upon which the effect of bad housing upon health could be reduced to measurable terms. In our own inquiry, we have made careful studies of the housing and living environment of all the workers examined, and these conditions have been related to the physical conditions of the workers. -As it has been frequently alleged that the factories with low sanitary standards also pay the lowest wages, and as the wage determines standards of living and health, our inquiry was amplified by a wage study according to trade process and character of factory. -Whether the evidence we have deduced in support of our conclusion is sufficient to stand the test of statistical verification along broader lines cannot be stated. The co-ordination of the factors we have endeavored to use, however, seems to us a fair basis upon which to judge the effects of trade processes upon health. -While in England the early victims of the sweating system were mainly English people, in the United States, and even in London at the present time, the immigrant population furnishes the vast majority of sweat-shop workers. In New York city the tailor trade was originally carried on by the English and Scotch, but about 1850 the Irish began to appear, and a little later the trade was taken up by the Germans. The sweating system practically began, however, in 1885, following the enormous immigration of the years immediately preceding. The Hungarian, German, and Austrian Jews had entered the trade as early as 1873, and soon afterward the Russian and Polish Jews appeared. By 1890 the Jews had gained entire control of the clothing industry in New York. The price of labor had fallen greatly, and a fierce competition reigned in all the larger cities of the United States, including New York, Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Chicago. In the same year the Italians entered the clothing trade in New York. Their entrance into the field reduced prices even further, and in addition they contributed the problem of home work. -Thus the clothing industry seems to have been the first resource of each of the alien races in turn, the more recent driving out the older immigrants, and all apparently using the sweat-shop system merely as a stepping-stone. -Passing over the element of race, there are traceable in the development of the clothing industry in this country three distinct stages: First, there was the journeyman tailor, a skilled mechanic who made up the entire garment himself, and who worked under fairly good conditions. The journeyman tailor has continued to perform a great part of the custom work, but his condition has steadily deteriorated, owing to the pressure of competition. -The second stage was the home shop, with division of labor, and for this, as for all subsequent developments, the large and increasing demand for ready-made clothing is largely responsible. While in 1870 probably less than 25 per cent, of the clothing manufactured in this country was ready made, in 1890 it was 60 per cent., and the proportion is considerably higher now. -An important factor in the supremacy of New York in the clothing business has been the prevalence there of the third method of production — the \"task\" system. Under this system the subdivision of labor and the economy of expert skill are carried to their extreme, and here the Jew, owing to his willingness to change his method of production, to use machinery, and to drive himself to the limit of exhaustion, has reigned supreme. The system originated about 1877, and practically took the place of the journeyman tailor in the coat-making trade. -It is an erroneous idea to suppose that sweat-shop clothing is necessarily poor in quality and manufactured under unfavorable conditions. On the contrary, overalls and working-men\\'s garments are usually manufactured in large factories under good conditions, while some of the worst features of the trade are to be found in the custom trade and in the manufacture of expensive garments. It was again and again stated before the Industrial Commission that no man in buying a custom-made suit, of the best and most fashionable tailor could have any assurance that it was not made in a sweatshop. The same thing may be said of all classes of women\\'s ready-made clothing. -With a few possible exceptions, work is more irregular in the clothing trade than in almost any other occupation. Months of feverish activity are supplemented by periodic unemployment, due to the seasonal character of the work. The rush periods begin in the fall, about the middle of August, and each period lasts from three to four months, with the uncertainty of work increasing in inverse ratio to the size of the shop. -As yet the method of lengthening the seasons of employment has been undertaken by few manufacturers. It is interesting to hear the uninitiated discuss the \"marvelous organization of modern industries.\" He need only inquire into the methods of steadying the seasons in almost any trade where wearing apparel is manufactured to discover proof of a most lamentable lack of efficient organization. So few are the efforts made in this direction that it becomes obvious business conditions have not compelled manufacturers to give sufficient attention to this problem. It would seem to be not so difficult to secure workers in the busy season as to compel manufacturers to devise means of prolonging their employment through twelve months. -For a better understanding of the facts relating to working conditions and their effect upon the health of employees a brief sketch of the business organization of this industry is here given: -men\\'s clothing are attended to by firms which make a special business of one phase or the other of the general industry. Few firms carry on the entire process of manufacture from the purchase of the material to the sale of the garments to the consumer. The most common type of manufacturer buys his cloth and trimming either directly from the factory or from a jobber and has them cut on his own premises. -The sponging is done on the premises when his business is extensive, otherwise he sends the cloth out to a firm that makes a specialty of sponging. When the cloth, lining, and trimming have been cut and arranged in lots and bundles, the contractor is called in. -The contractor undertakes the work of actually making up the garments. Generally he devotes himself to the making of one part of the garment only, as the coat, pants, or vest. -These differences in business organizations are not without their effect on labor. In the first place, the \"inside shop, \" or the type of factory manufacturing the entire garment upon the premises, means factory system, with regular hours, prompt and regular payment of wages, workshops built for this purpose, and in consequence a conforming to high standards in sanitation. -On the other hand, while in these shops the factory system reaches the highest development, for the most part a high degree of division of labor obtains, which confines the worker within a limited and recurring process. -There is here scope for the employment of workers possessed of less general all-round skill. The \"inside shop\" is likely also to use the contract shop as an evener, receiving excess work, so that in slack periods he suffers first. This means, of course, steadier employment for those engaged in the inside shops. -The concentration of the industry in the down-town or congested section of the city is primarily due to the dependence of the industry on foreign labor and its proximity to sources of supply. -The contractor, on the other hand, has a vital interest in his shop, and gives it the utmost supervision, which is not difficult in a small factory. He takes in learners and gets their labor cheap. His position differs from the foreman of an inside shop in that his income is not fixed, but is dependent on output and cheaper cost of production. Also, he is himself willing to work hard and long, demanding the same of his employees. Working for a number of wholesalers, he can have steadier work than a small inside shop, and as he is personally acquainted with his workers, he can reduce their number in slack periods without disrupting his shop, or get them back again when work is plentiful. -The \"inside shop,\" when very large and conducted in connection with a number of contractors, can frequently manufacture more cheaply. Moreover, it can keep its own employees continuously at work by leaving the contractor without work in dull periods. Notwithstanding the fact that these shops, as a rule, are superior places of work, the contract shop is not infrequently preferred by the workers for personal reasons. The absence of discipline and personal contact between \"boss\" and workers are the reasons given. In the inside shop a stricter discipline is observed throughout, smoking is prohibited, regularity and promptness are required, and this interference with freedom is resented by certain classes of workers. As one worker put it: \"I don\\'t like to have some one over me watching me every time I get up. I want to be free to move around as I please.\" -From the point of view of labor, the disadvantages of the contract shops are, in part, poor and unsanitary workshops, long hours, and the small scale on which they operate. In order to save rent, the contractor often locates in a building, or part of a building, not originally intended, and, hence often unsuited, for shop purposes. He is tempted to crowd in order to save room and rent, and his shop lacks necessary sanitary facilities, adequate ventilation, and the ordinary requirements for cleanliness. -These shops are scattered and numerous and so lose the incentive for high standards resulting from regular factory inspection. There are some contract shops, however, that are model establishments from the standpoint of sanitary conditions. In Germany and Sweden high standards are successfully maintained in the small workshops. -In its earlier form the \"sweating system\" was practically identical with the subcontract system, the difference between the price paid the contractor and the price paid the subcontractor or actual worker being considered as \"sweated\" from the normal earnings of the latter. Of late years, however, the tendency has been to reduce the cost by eliminating the subcontractor, without in any way changing the labor conditions. -The following definition of the sweating system is given by Mr. Henry White, formerly general secretary of the United Garment Workers of America: \"The term \\'sweating system\\' has a general meaning, but is specifically used to describe a condition of labor in which a maximum amount of work in a given time is performed for a minimum wage, and in which the ordinary rules of health and comfort are disregarded.\" (White: \"The Sweating System,\" Bulletin of the United States Department of Labor No. 4, p. 360.) -This definition brings out the three characteristic evils of the sweating system: (a) Low wages; (6) long hours, and (c) unsanitary workshops. In the last-named evil is implied a fourth — the danger to the health of the worker laboring under these conditions, and to the consumer from the use of sweat-shop goods. The final process in the manufacture of clothing in the sweat-shop is the removal of the grease, dirt, and vermin that have collected, but the less obvious accumulation of possible disease germs generally passes unnoticed. -The causes of the sweating evil are somewhat complex and even obscure. It has been found, moreover, that it is a serious mistake to regard the middleman or \"sweater\" as himself the cause, or even a contributing cause, of the evil. The typical sweater is little, if any, better off than his employees, and is himself a victim of the system. Another view is that the ultimate cause of the system is the weakening of the race through the bad sanitary and hygienic conditions prevalent in cities, which render the individual inefficient and incapable of competition with those who have lived under better conditions. This idea, however, fails to account for the fact that in the United States thousands of victims of the sweating system come from the agricultural communities of Europe, and for the further fact that only a small proportion of the children of sweat-shop workers are themselves found in sweat-shops. Nevertheless a leading cause of the sweating system is undoubtedly the lack of competitive ability on the part of large numbers of wage-earners — a lack, however, which is principally due to ignorance, absence of industrial training, and a low standard of life. -A second leading cause of the sweating system is the fact that in certain industries the general rule that the big shop can produce more cheaply than the small one does not hold good. The fact is, of course, largely dependent upon the former cause, for the small shop holds its supremacy only by reason of the oversupply of cheap and needy labor. -The large establishment, moreover, is far more subject to legislative supervision than the small, which maintains its economic position by driving down wages to the subsistence point, and below, by indefinitely prolonging hours and by wholly neglecting sanitary conditions. The large use of woman\\'s labor and the small amount of skill required in this highly specialized industry also contribute to the success of the small shops. The foreigner, moreover, ignorant of the English language, is at the mercy of some small contractor, probably of his own nationality, from whom he learns a single process of manufacture and by whom he is carefully guarded from the knowledge of any means of escape. -shop is the seasonal character of the trade. Outside of the two rush seasons of three or four months each, there is little work. If the manufacturer maintained his own establishment, this fact would be a serious inconvenience and loss to him, while it would be hardly possible for him to increase his working capacity rapidly enough during the rush seasons. By the contract system, however, he throws all the losses of the dull period upon the employees. Under it he can wait until the last moment to buy his goods, and can then distribute them broadcast to be made up in the minimum time. By means of this system a mass of unskilled labor is effectively organized for work when wanted, and is cast adrift readily when the work is over. -Aside from the three evils which we have seen to be inseparably connected with sweating, the main features of the system are, generally, minute subdivision of labor and the contract system, with a fixed piece price or wage. -It is interesting to note, in passing, that this type of workshop corresponds more nearly to the conditions under which that group of workers following this same trade in Russia have labored than any other, with the additional custom there, and formerly in this country, of boarding the workers in the home shop. Thus they become an integral part of the employer\\'s family life, assuming many responsibilities quite apart from the trade itself. The standard of life is very low, the workroom being used for sleeping quarters and all other needs and purposes. -A common variety of \"sweating\" is carried on in workrooms used especially for that purpose. These are connected with the living rooms of the \"sweater,\" in buildings which are not used for residential purposes. They have been found in rear tenements and over barns which have been condemned as unfit for human habitations. The machines in these shops are run by electricity, although occasionally pressing irons are found heated in ovens. As the size of the shops and the number of employees increase, the \"sweater\" becomes more and more an overseer, driving the laborers to the greatest possible speed for the longest possible hours. Although wages are still by the piece, only rapid work and long hours will enable the work people to hold their places in these shops, for the burden of expense which the sweater bears is comparatively heavy, and he is obliged by competition to turn out the maximum amount of work with a given equipment. -HOME WORKERS. The question of home work has not only had much attention in this country, but it has for a long time been recognized as an evil in many European countries. -Sir Thomas Oliver, in \"Dangerous Trades,\" page 98, cites the following conclusions as regards home work: \"Apart from the perils of starvation wages and excessive hours, one of the main facts brought out by recent investigations into home work is the grave danger to the health of both the worker and the community at large arising from the making of garments in disease-infected and otherwise unsanitary homes, and public opinion has been gradually ripening to the conclusion that legal restrictions of some kind are necessary to protect public health. Furthermore, it is beginning to be recognized that the application to outwork of the laws that regulate labor in the factory is a perfectly reasonable and logical extension, as outwork is practically an extension of factory work, or it may be more properly described as its \\'backwash.\\' Outworkers are employed mainly in the surplusage of factory workers — the unskilled and poorly paid work that the workshop rejects or that the pressure of a big order prevents her wholly overtaking. The low degree of skill required for the most part, and the consequent low earnings, have their inevitable result in placing the section of the industry in the hands of the very class of workers whose conditions most need supervision and control.\" -In recent investigations, as well as in earlier investigations in America and abroad, the testimony shows that whenever home work exists, much of it is done in the midst of unhealthy surroundings. -Home finishing is not confined to a cheap grade of garments, or to such as are made by contractors. It is resorted to by the makers of all grades of clothing, by leading manufacturers who maintain large inside shops, as well as by the small contractors. -Formerly almost all finishing was done in the homes, but the \"inside shop\" has now developed sufficiently to bring a large proportion of, but not all, the work within the shop or factory. This development has not, however, kept pace with the great growth of the clothing industry which would make it appear, as a consequence, that the actual amount of home work is increasing. -Among the Italians and several Hebrews this form of labor was carried on in the homes of a large number of the factory workers studied in this inquiry by other members of the family. -For a representative group from the sociological point of view, however, 20 home workers without factory hours were selected for intensive study. -The clothing industry is considered the largest field for home work connected with the sewing trades. The women engaged in home work are usually of foreign birth, Italians predominating, who have practically a -monopoly of home work. The married Italian women take up this work upon arrival in America, usually without any previous experience in the sewing trades, and continue it for years. -The evils begin in the small loft, from which are carried on the heads, backs, and arms of women and children heavy bundles of clothing and so transported through the streets. These usually weigh more than the children who carry them, and not infrequently the physical condition of women is such that the weight is a positive injury. -The influence of home work upon children of school age was investigated from the point of view of school attendance, and unlike the experience of New York, was found negligible. -In none of the schools located in the districts where garment workers resided, both home and factory workers, was any influence to be traced to school attendance and scholarship. -The Department of Health reports 2500 home workers (not classified) in this city to whom work permits have been issued; while this permit is required by the department for each worker, the laxity of manufacturers in demanding them is responsible for dozens of infractions of this law. -That the United States Government recognizes the danger of contagion through home manufacturing is set forth in the following, from a review of Professor Commons\\' testimony before the Industrial Commission (Report of Industrial Commission, 1901, vol. xx, page 31): -\"While neither the Federal Government nor any State Government has undertaken to abolish tenement home work when the work is sold to private purchasers, yet where the Federal Government is itself a purchaser of clothing, it has undertaken to establish this condition. Since the Spanish-American War, when it seemed to be clearly demonstrated that the contagion of measles and other diseases in the army was owing directly to tenement house manufacture, the War Department has inserted in its contracts with the manufacturers of military garments that all work must be done in a regularly organized factory, and no part of the work shall be sublet to contractors. -\"In several states clothing for the National Guard is usually purchased from the War Department, and is, therefore, protected by the specification of that department, but in those states where clothing is purchased by the state authorities there exist at present but few restrictions. -— Represents a perfectly dark hallway. The building from which this was ined ten small simps. The simps, being on the outside, were well lighted. The cways and stairs are a distinct menace in case of tire. -Because of the long periods of idleness, these workers make the most of the busy season when it comes, and by taking as many garments as can be secured, work unlimited hours and strain to the utmost to complete their tasks. There were instances where women said they worked from 6 or 7 a. m. to 9, 10, or n at night. -Generally speaking,many of the home workers are past middle age, and their husbands have reached the age when their earning power decreases rapidly. A considerable number, therefore, are unemployed during the entire year, or employed for only a small portion of the year. -This fact, taken into consideration with the yearly earnings for the majority of those men, indicates the inability of most of them to advance beyond a certain stage in their earning power. -Another factor is that the Italians, who are in the majority in this class, being unskilled in American methods of production, engage largely in outdoor employment. They work chiefly as common laborers, which is poorly paid at best and very irregular. -In Philadelphia, because of the delivery system employed to some extent by the manufacturers, a higher grade of home workers is employed. The home workers here are on a firmer economic footing, living in better homes, some owning their houses, and do not appear to be in great financial need. -It is not claimed that all home finishing is done under unsanitary or revolting conditions; yet the fact that it can be done under such conditions, and that much of it is so done, forces the conclusion that such a method of manufacture should be abolished in the interest of public health. -The Committee on Manufactures of the House of Representatives, in its report on the sweating system (Report No. 2309), gave as one reason to confining their labors to the clothing industry the fact that the dangers to the public welfare were more serious in that than in other sweated industries. -The conditions under which work by, say, 1000 people, is done in a factory, can be inspected frequently, but to attempt to visit that number of home finishers with any effect is useless. -FIRE RISK.— VENTILATION AND LIGHT.— DUST— WASH AND DRESSING ROOMS.— TOILET FACILITIES— CUSPIDORS.— DANGEROUS MACHINERY.— WASTE RECEPTACLES. -Taking up the various factors which may have a bearing on the relation of the physical condition of the workers to their occupation, we have to consider first the work place itself. -As this investigation was restricted to shops in which the garments are made up, no special attention was paid to distribution by sex, but all the workers found therein were examined indiscriminately. This fact will explain, for example, why it is that, contrary to the results reported in the United States Government Report on \"Men\\'s Ready Made Clothing\" (vol. 2, page 16), a higher percentage of men than of women was found employed in this industry. -To establish the relationship existing between the sanitary condition of the place of employment and the physical condition of the worker was an object of first importance in this study. It should be borne in mind, however, that the workers\\' frequent shift from factory to factory renders an accurate estimate of the influence of working conditions upon the individual in the course of a number of years impossible. -This investigation covered 43 factories, employing a total of 2098 workers. The most significant facts in connection with the inquiry into the sanitary conditions of the factories are to be found in the frequency of unhygienic conditions and the variety of defects and deficiencies which many of the factories presented. -These figures indicate that in the 43 factories examined, 422 defects were found, or an average of nearly 10 conditions prejudicial to health and safety per factory. -In this connection, however, it is to be borne in mind that the majority of the places we had access to were of the poorer type. Inasmuch as the study was made without the official authority of either the city or state departments of health, our entrance into a shop or factory was dependent on the willingness of the owner to have an inspection made. It is interesting to note that we had little trouble in gaining the consent of the smaller factory owners, and that absolute refusal to permit a survey was encountered in several of the very best type of shops. As to the working-people themselves, it was exceptional to encounter one who did not cheerfully submit to an examination and later to an exhaustive inquiry as to his or her industrial life. -In most instances there was no question as to the presence or absence of the defects noted, as they were perfectly obvious. The only factor involving the personal equation was that concerning ventilation, and even in regard to this we feel that our observation was at least approximately correct. -FIRE RISK. The safety of workers from the point of view of fire risk appears, then, to be seriously endangered by the conditions found to prevail in the estab-Fig. 3. — Shows ;i fire-escape lowered into a manure pit; the lower end is further obstructed by an abandoned wagon filled with junk. When first seen, the fire-escape was elevated. Following a report of the condition, the escape was lowered, but nothing was done in regard to Ihe other defects. -lishments examined. While it appears that only 22.2 per cent, of the workers were employed in places without adequate fire-escapes, the figures relating to the presence of fire risks due to obstructed exits, prevalence of smoking, locked doors, presence of waste and accumulation of debris, etc., indicate that 2062, or 94.9 per cent., of the workers were employed in the establishments presenting conditions of serious fire risks. -In view of the recent fires occurring in clothing manufactories in New York state, and the resulting overwhelming loss of life, it is to be hoped that these figures will bear special significance in pointing out the need for prevention in Pennsylvania. -If to the figures relating to lack of fire-escapes and fire risk we add the facts that 30 factories studied, employing 1515, or 69.6 per cent., of the workers, were without emergency provisions, and that 39 factories, with 1221 workers, or 56.1 per cent., of the total, no fire drills were held, the problem of fire prevention becomes alarmingly serious. -If the same proportion of fire risks exists throughout the entire industry in this city, the risk of life involved may be said to be a matter for immediate action on the part of the local authorities and the State Department of Labor. -While fire risks per se cannot be considered an element influencing health, invariably the conditions entailing fire risks arise from conditions of neglect and carelessness which in themselves represent a sanitary evil measurable in the reduction of air space, through the accumulation of storage, waste, etc., the accumulation and inhalation of dust, and the obstruction of windows and doors that might otherwise be used for ventilation. -It has been shown that the air breathed by the employees in a factory or workshop can be kept pure in two ways: (1) By constantly renewing from outside all the air of the room in which work is carried on. (2) By removing impurities locally, or otherwise preventing them from ever mixing with the air breathed. The former process may be distinguished as general, and the latter as local, ventilation. As a general rule, dust and fumes can best be dealt with by local ventilation or by other means, whereas impurities due to the emanations from the employees and lights burning must be got rid of by general ventilation. -The practical difficulties confronting efforts at adequate ventilation in the case of sedentary occupation are frequently pointed out; but the objection on the part of employees to proper ventilation depends sometimes on the absence of proper heating arrangements during cold weather. This -often leads to further vitiation of the air through the lighting of gas burners for heating purposes during the day. -Unfortunately, very little material progress has been made, even by experts, to give enlightened employers and labor leaders definite standards of ventilation and methods of securing it. And while much progress has been made in factory sanitation, the evidence is entirely conclusive that present conditions affecting health and life in industry leave much to be desired. -In the matter of ventilation it was found that almost one-half (19) of the factories examined, employing a total of 800, or 36.8 per cent., of the workers, were insufficiently ventilated. While no instruments of precision were available for a scientific test of atmospheric conditions in these factories, the presence of impurities, such as carbon monoxide gas, and humidity was apparent to even a lay investigator. The defects found were due, for the most part, to indifference and ignorance, as well as to structural defects, such as low ceilings, stationary windows, etc. -No doubt was left in the mind of the investigator, however, as to the possibilities of improving the ventilation of such rooms without any change in the structural conditions. -Had we used instruments in the measurement of air changes and impurities, we would have had the task of fixing standards consistent with the conditions under which this industry is carried on. -The Department of Labor should prescribe a standard of sufficient ventilation for any class of factories or workshops, and that standard should be observed in all factories and workshops of that class. -In regard to the lighting facilities of the shops examined, it may be said that, with one exception, all the buildings in which the shops were located had ample window space and furnished sufficient light. During the winter months, however, artificial light is necessary, sometimes, during the greater part of the day. There is practically no attempt made to so arrange the lighting facilities that the workers will obtain the light under proper conditions. And the same may be said of the natural light. Insufficient or improper lighting undoubtedly has much to do with the occurrence of headaches and eye-strain. -Dirt, rubbish, and a general appearance of dilapidation were characteristic of the poorer places. The amount of dust in the factories examined was variable in quantity. Dust produced by the trade itself cannot be considered, however, as being in sufficient quantity to greatly affect health. For the most part the dust was the accumulation of weeks and even -months, and such as might occur in any working-place, which was rarely, if ever, subjected to a regular cleaning. From an economic standpoint it would be to the interest of the manufacturer to insure cleanliness. During the process of manufacture the clothing lies about on the floor, and is being constantly trodden upon by the workers. In the manufacture of shirtwaists the shops are nearly always clean, and the garments, both incompleted and completed, are kept in boxes beside the workers. The reason for this is obvious. If white goods become soiled in the process of manufacture, an additional expense is incurred to have them laundered. There is no good reason why woolen garments should not be protected in the same way. On the one hand, the public would be protected against obtaining clothing which had been subjected to all kinds of unsanitary treatment, and, on the other, the manufacturer would be spared the expense of removing dirt and grease. -As lunch rooms were provided in only one out of a total of the 43 factories examined, and as most of the workers take the noon meal at the worktable in the workrooms, the importance of wash-room facilities is apparent. It was found, however, that only four factories had such provisions, and that 1313, or 64.3 per cent., of the workers were without such facilities. -The dressing room, as is well known, has the double function of giving privacy to the sexes, and when separate lockers are provided, renders the possibility of infection through the clothing negligible. -The use of separate clothing during working hours is a desideratum, and reduces the possibility of infection in the home to a minimum. -Notwithstanding the passage in this state of the Factory Act of 1909 and the Woman\\'s Labor Bill in the 1913 Pennsylvania Legislature requiring the provision of dressing rooms, in most of the small shops where an attempt to comply with the letter of the law is made, the \"room\" is nothing more than a makeshift arrangement, partitioned off in one corner of the general workroom, inadequate as to space and unsatisfactory from every other standpoint. Thirty-four factories without such rooms, although representing a large proportion of the establishments examined, affected the comfort of a comparatively small number of workers — 771, or 35.5 per cent, of the total. -The wash-room facilities, while not a necessity from the point of view of the sanitation of the factory, is an important factor in the promotion of personal hygiene. Our investigation showed that 37 out of a total of 43 -factories had no wash-rooms, and that in these factories 13 13 workers, or 64.2 per cent, of the total in the factories examined, were affected. -Pennsylvania for several years — since 1909 — has had upon its statute books adequate legislation covering toilet requirements. In section 9 of the Woman\\'s Bill, passed in the 1913 legislature, the following provision is made: -\"Every person employing or permitting females to work in any establishment shall provide suitable washand dressing-rooms and waterclosets, or privies, for their use, so located as to be accessible to such females. In any establishment in which males and females shall be employed or permitted to work, separate washand dressing-rooms and water-clbsets, or privies, shall be provided for each sex : and such washand dressing-rooms and water-closets, or privies, for each sex, shall be entirely separate from those provided for the other sex. The water-closets or privies provided for females shall be in the ratio of one for every twenty-five females employed or permitted to work. All water-closets or privies shall be properly lighted, and shall be separated from the rooms in which employees shall be permitted to work by partitions extending from floor to ceiling, and the compartments containing such water-closets or privies shall have sufficient direct outside ventilation, by window or other means. The entrances to the water-closets or privies shall be screened from the rooms in which employees work, and from the entrances to the water-closets or privies provided for the other sex, by screens or partitions at least six feet high. All water-closets or privies shall at all times be kept clean, sanitary, and free from all obscene writing or marking.\" -The lack of standardization and enforcement of these laws, however, is responsible for conditions of insanitation and unspeakable neglect, seriously jeopardizing the health and comfort of the workers. -It is a matter of much concern that we find 34, or more than threefourths of the factories, inadequately equipped in proper toilet facilities affecting 877, or 40.3 per cent., of the workers employed in the establishments examined. -The failure to provide separate toilets for the sexes constitutes a special hardship for the women. -In the eight factories where provision for separation of the sexes was not made, 139, or 6.4 per cent., of all the workers were affected. -The conditions of ventilation and lighting of toilets constitute the gravest of the many evils. More than one-half, or 23, of the factories had -along wall. As picture was taken by flash-light it does not indicate fact that women were doing fine -insufficiently lighted and poorly ventilated toilets, affecting 534, or 24.6 per cent., of the workers. -The merest essentials of cleanliness of toilets were neglected in 34 of the factories, surpassing even the most pessimistic expectations of the investigators. Almost one-third — 705 of the workers, or 32.5 per cent. — were affected by these conditions. -CUSPIDORS. The common practice of expectoration among male workers is well known. In only two of the larger factories was provision of cuspidors made to meet this condition, while in the remaining 41, with a working population of n 23, or 51.6 per cent., the situation received no attention. -The facts brought out in the course of this inquiry relating to dangerously exposed machinery cannot be considered final, since the investigators\\' limited technical knowledge of machinery would make apparent to her only the most obvious dangers. Thus, in only two factories, involving serious risk to 80 workers, were conditions found to require immediate attention. -The provision of receptacles for waste is a necessity, not only as a preventive in dust accumulation, but also against fire. -In 20, or one-half, of the factories no such provisions were made. It is worthy of note, however, that while the number of factories failing such provisions is large, the number of persons employed in them was only 302, or 13.9 per cent, of the total. -The relation of structural and hygienic conditions of the factories to the health of employer and employees will be discussed under the separate heading of The Relation of Working Environment to Physical Condition, which was the subject of careful investigation and correlation. -NATIONALITY.— CONJUGAL CONDITION— LENGTH OF RESIDENCE IN THE UNITED STATES AND LENGTH OF TIME IN THE TRADE.— AGE AT BEGINNING WORK. -In estimating the effect of this particular trade on the health of the workers, one must not lose sight of certain racial peculiarities. In sketching the evolution of the garment-making industry, attention was called to the present-day supremacy of the Jews in the trade. It is not surprising, therefore, that the majority of the people studied by us were of this nationality. -The following table shows the percentage of each nationality among the 402 males and 341 females intensively studied: -These figures show very clearly the preponderance of Jews, especially among the males; next to the Hebrews, the Italian women are most numerous. -The effect of racial composition of workers upon shop organization is also interesting, since it results in a tendency to organize the shops along the lines of one race. This is especially true in the smaller and contract shops, where often every employee is of the same race, and even in the large factories the tendency is to recruit the employees from the same race as the foreman, with the broad exception of the general employment of Italian women. -There is no industry with which we are familiar in which race traits count for as much as in the garment-making trade. Composed as it is so -largely of Jews, this race has contributed not a little to the rise of certain evils of which probably the greatest is the so-called \"speeding-up\" process. Piece work, to some extent, has brought this about. Dependent as his wages are on the amount of his daily output, the worker goes at top speed, and the Jew, beyond all others, possesses the capacity to drive himself to the extreme limit of his endurance. He does this largely because of an ambition to better himself, and to accumulate sufficient means to start in business for himself; and while but relatively few reach the goal of their ambition, the effort costs many of them their health. -The Italians, on the other hand, work easily, and while many of the women work overtime in the home, they rarely make any effort to drive themselves at top speed, as does the Jew, and the same is true of the phlegmatic Lithuanians. -CONJUGAL CONDITION. The only noticeable fact in the following tables is that, among the males, 251 (62.4 per cent.) were married, while among the females 242 (73.9 per cent.) of 341 were single, and in addition 21 were widowed. -Another factor which has considerable economic importance is the question of the experience of the employee. Workers in the garment-making trade are recruited almost exclusively from the newly arrived immigrants, who, as a rule, are without experience. Inasmuch as the work is finely subdivided and is readily learned, the employer is reasonably certain of being able to obtain, with little or no difficulty, an adequate number of workers. Because of the necessity of getting immediate employment, and because of his lack of f amiliarity with the work, the beginner works for a small wage. -That these workers are, for the most part, unskilled upon their arrival in this country is indicated in the following tables. These tables, which give the figures for the males, show how closely the trade life of the individual corresponds to the length of residence in the United States. The same fact is disclosed in the figures relating to the females. -Fig. 7. — Shows a dark and very filthy closet and a sink which furnished the only watersupply for the entire building. Picture taken after bad conditions were reported and evils remedied -four for both sexes the length of residence in the United States and the trade life are practically identical. Among the older workers the figures indicate that a few have had some experience in the home country. -* Those born in the United States are not included in finding averages. COMPARISON OF YEARS IN UNITED STATES AND YEARS IN TRADE. -* Figures in heavy type, those born in United States, numbering 33, are not included in the averages. -AGE AT STARTING TO WORK. The age at which they started going to work is shown in the following tables. As is to be expected, the great majority enter the trade under the age of seventeen, namely, 89 per cent, of the males and 71.8 per cent, of the females. -HEALTH ON GOING TO WORK— PRESENT PHYSICAL APPEARANCE.— HEIGHT, WEIGHT, AND CHEST MEASUREMENTS— RELATION OF TRADE LIFE TO PRESENT PHYSICAL CONDITION— MORBIDITY RATE AMONG GARMENT-MAKERS AS SHOWN BY HOSPITAL AND DISPENSARY EXPERIENCE. -HEALTH ON GOING TO WORK. So far we were able to ascertain as the result of a painstaking history of each worker, the condition of health was almost universally good for the entire group of both males and females. -According to these tables, only 2 (0.49 per cent.) out of 402 male employees were in poor health on going to work; 29 (7.2 per cent.) were in fair health, while 371 (92.3 per cent.) were in good health. -Among the females only 3 (0.79 per cent.) were in poor health; 13 (3.81 per cent.) were in fair health, and 325 (95.2 per cent.) were in good health. -An examination of the data recorded in the above tables gives a fair representation of the same people after a varying length of time in the industry. It will be noted that among the males, 242, or 60.2 per cent., are classed as representing a good appearance, as against 92.3 per cent, classed as healthy on entering the trade; 29.1 per cent, a fairly good appearance, as compared to 7.2 per cent, in fair health and 10.7 per cent, a poor appearance, as compared to 0.49 per cent, originally classed as being in poor health. -Among the females, 69.1 per cent, were found to present a good appearance, as compared to 95.2 per cent, classed as healthy on entering the trade; 24.9 per cent, fair as compared to 3.81 per cent, in fair health, and 5.8 per cent, a poor appearance, in comparison with 0.79 per cent, entering the trade in poor health. -The wear and tear of industrial life seem to be appreciably greater among the males than the females, although it is to be borne in mind that other factors may play a part; and of these, probably the most important is the fact that marriage removes the women from the trade. This is indicated in the tables where it is shown that the number of women remaining in the industry after the age period 15-19 steadily diminishes. -HEIGHT, WEIGHT, AND CHEST MEASUREMENTS. The figures given in regard to the height and weight and the measurements for the chest show that the group as a whole conforms to the average standards. There is nothing in these figures to indicate that the workers are physically inferior. On the contrary, the Italian women, and particularly both the Lithuanian men and women, are far above the average from the physical standpoint. -THE RELATION OF TRADE LIFE TO PRESENT PHYSICAL CONDITION. In the following tables are shown the various disabilities encountered at the time of the physical examination and the taking of the history: -An examination of the above tables shows that among the 402 males, 145 were negative and 257 had some abnormal condition present; among the 341 females, 135 were negative while 206 presented some abnormality. -Taken as a whole, the data indicate that there is a certain regularity in the increase of the proportion of persons affected by disease with the increase of the trade life, and the susceptibility of the two sexes is about the same — 63.7 per cent, for the males and 60.4 per cent, for the females. If, however, we take into account the fact that the same worker may suffer from more than one ailment, we find that for every 100 workers there are 230 ailments for every 100 female workers, and only 140 for every 100 male workers. In this connection it is to be borne in mind that the women are on the average younger and have a shorter trade life than the men. -Although the tendency to some physical ailment increases as the trade life extends, it is to be remembered that this same tendency to physical ailments, especially those of a functional character, such as indigestion and constipation, is true in regard to all classes of people as they advance in years. -The great frequency of \"colds\" — 19.2 per cent, among the males and 38.7 per cent, among the females — emphasizes the close relationship which exists between these acute infections and overheated and badly ventilated rooms. -The disabilities deserving of special notice are muscular strain, headache, tuberculosis, and inflammation of the eyes. These subjects are apparently closely related to the trade, although not peculiar to it, with the exception of conjunctivitis, which seems to be directly due to one of the trade processes. Later in the report the significance of these affections will be dealt with when their relation to other aspects of the problem is considered. -In order to get an idea as to the general morbidity rate among garment workers, the records of three large general hospitals were analyzed. Out of a total of 32,211 records examined, 1152, or 3.5 per cent., were classed as garment workers. Of this number 916 were males and 236 females. By far the greatest number of the records examined related to dispensary patients, and while these records are not always as accurately kept as one would wish, the information they furnish serves to indicate in a general way the degree and character of morbidity. -The figures relating to tuberculosis are not excessive. They undoubtedly represent all the cases in which the disease was in various stages of activity. Inasmuch as hospital statistics are based on a diagnosis representing the principal illness from which the patient is suffering, if he has more -than one complaint there is no way of telling how many latent or suspicious cases of tuberculosis there were. -Next to tuberculosis the conditions which are of especial interest are those apparently connected with the trade, namely, neurasthenia, neuritis, myalgia, rheumatism, so called, and eye-strain. It will be recalled that in the list of complaints given by the workers intensively studied several ailments were quite common, namely, muscular strain and headache. It is not unlikely that the tiredness or muscular strain and the headache so prevalent among those at work may be the forerunners of the conditions which eventually cause the worker to seek relief in a hospital. -Neurasthenia was noted among 16.2 per cent, of the males and 38.2 per cent, of the females. Bearing in mind that of these hospital cases, 81.4 per cent, of the males a nd 79.3 per cent, of the females were Jews, the diagnosis of neurasthenia cannot be altogether relied on, as this race is notoriously neurasthenic. It is quite likely, however, that fatigue may aggravate this natural tendency. -The number of cases of neuritis was quite high, especially among the males. Of 52 males suffering from some form of neuritis, it is interesting to note that 26, or 50 per cent., were recorded as being pressers. As pressers are often listed under the general term tailor, it is possible that even more workers in this trade process were involved. -As the diagnosis of neuritis was not always made in a neurological clinic, it is quite likely that in many instances the condition was an occupation neurosis rather than a true neuritis. In either case, however, the data serve to show that these painful conditions are not infrequent. -Among the males, myalgia and rheumatism, muscular and chronic, were also noted as being of frequent occurrence. Myalgia and muscular rheumatism probably represent instances of extreme fatigue of a group of muscles. Both conditions are closely related to the occupation neuroses. Chronic rheumatism is a very indefinite term which may refer to pain in the joint itself, or it may be in the muscles about the joint. -It is rather surprising that the number of cases of eye-strain is so small, especially when we consider the high percentage of workers who complain of headache. -In the group which we studied intensively it was noted that 19.9 per cent, of the men and 14.9 per cent, of the women had errors of refraction for which glasses were worn. -Other nervous disorders were noted among 2.3 per cent, of the males and 4.7 per cent, of the females. -OPERATORS— BASTERS AND FINISHERS— PRESSERS.— SKILLED WORKERS (BUSHELMEN, EXAMINERS, CUTTERS, FOREMEN). -In an occupation such as the one under discussion it is important to determine, as far as possible, the direct effect the employment may have upon the worker — and by direct effect we have reference to any injury for which the employment itself may be responsible. Occupations vary tremendously in this respect. Thus in those occupations in which the worker is exposed to traumatic accidents or to the influence of a metallic poison, such as lead, the effect is direct and unquestionable, and in the absence of proper safeguards such accidents are apt to occur independently of what the workman may do, although they are, of course, greatly increased by carelessness on his part. -In many occupations, among which may be classed garment making, there is nothing of the nature of an acute illness comparable with an accident. Usually it is a gradual deterioration of health that is produced. And, in determining the cause of this deterioration of health we must not lose sight of the various factors involved, namely, bad factory sanitation, the habits and home surroundings of the worker, poverty, heredity, age, and sex. -In the tables which follow the attempt has been made to ascertain the number of workers who suffered from ailments which reasonably could be ascribed to the work itself, although even in the case of these ailments, as will be shown later, other contributory factors undoubtedly exerted some influence in their production. -For a proper understanding of the tables it may be stated that the figures relating to \"arms,\" \"back,\" and \"legs\" refer to strain or undue tiring. The data relating to the eyes refer to inflammatory conditions, which in some instances are apparently directly traceable to one of the trade processes. -The following tables show the distribution of physical ailments, according to age, among the 402 male workers and the 341 female workers: -These tables show that among the males those with a long trade life form the majority of the workers, while among the females the number remaining in the trade after the twenty-fourth year rapidly diminishes. -Physical ailments were much more common among the males than among the females, the percentages being 25.8 and 14.6 respectively. The greater frequency of ailments among males is apparently due to the fact that they have a longer trade lif e than the females, and are thus increasingly liable to the harmful effects of the trade. -In the tables which follow the physical ailments are studied in their relationship to the various trade processes. -The major part of the sewing on a factory-made garment is done by power machines. All persons operating sewing machines are grouped under the occupation term \"operators.\" The character of the work done by the operator, however, varies greatly: it may be very simple or it may require a high degree of skill, as in the sewing of a shoulder seam or sewing in a sleeve. The majority of the workers in this trade process are males. It is in this branch of the work that \"speeding up\" is more prevalent than in any of the other trade processes. -The table relating to the males shows that the majority of the ailments referable to the trade process occur in the age groups 20-24 and 25-34 years. It is also to be noted that the arms and back are implicated most frequently. This is to be explained by the character of the work which brings these parts of the body into play. -The eye affections represent mild forms of conjunctivitis. Varying degrees of congestion of the conjunctiva are relatively frequent, and are probably due, partly, to artificial lighting, and partly to the fact that the workers are rarely so placed that the lighting facilities are used to the best advantage. -The number of females in this group is too small to draw any conclusions from. It does indicate, however, that young girls seem to be more susceptible to the strain of this work than the males in the same age group. Thus among 29 females from fifteen to nineteen years of age, 17.2 per cent, were affected, while among 54 males of the same age but 9.1 per cent, had physical ailments attributable to the trade process. -BASTERS AND FINISHERS. While the operator\\'s work is done entirely by machinery, that of the baster and finisher is done by hand. Furthermore, while males form the -This trade process consists in assembling the different parts of the garment and fastening them together with coarse running stitches. In like manner the canvas, hair-cloth, and padding used to give shape to the coat are fastened to the garment by the baster. -Buttonhole making, button-sewing, putting on labels and hangers are also largely done by hand. The basters and finishers comprise the largest group studied, numbering 328 in all — 266 females and 62 males. The following tables show the distribution of ailments by age groups: -It will be noted in the table relating to females that muscular strain referable to the back is the most common affection. As the women are apt to sit leaning forward, the strain of this constantly fixed posture is doubtless largely responsible for the number of these complaints. It must be borne in mind, however, that among women backache is not infrequently complained of. Among the male basters and finishers backache plays no part at all. -In comparing the operators, composed of both males and females, the males predominating, with the basters and finishers, also composed of both -males and females, but with the females predominating, we find that ailments attributable to trade processes occur in 16.3 per cent, of the operators and in 12.2 per cent, of the basters and finishers. The higher percentage of ailments among the operators may be ascribed to two factors: (1) The greater physical strain involved in operating and (2) the longer trade life of the men, who comprise the great majority of the operators. -The final step in the manufacture of a ready-made garment is the pressing. This is sometimes done with hand-irons weighing from 8 to 1 2 pounds. The heavier work, however, is done by an iron which is attached to a horizontal arm and is swung into position on the garment. The pressure is obtained by a foot lever which forces the ironing board up against the iron. Formerly the irons were heated over an open coal fire, and in a few shops this is still done. But for the most part the iron, instead of being solid, is hollow, and is kept constantly heated by means of a gas-flame within the iron. With the exception of the cutters, who are few in number, the pressers are the only ones whose work requires a standing posture. -Pressing is exclusively an occupation of males in the ready-made clothing industry. In this group, the third largest studied, numbering 108 workers, the physical ailments bear an interesting relation to the trade process. In fact, it is the one process in which the relationship between cause and effect appears to be reasonably certain. -In this table it is to be noted that 35, or 32.2 per cent., of the group are forty-five years of age or older, and that nearly one-half (44.4 per cent.) of the entire group have some physical ailment. -Muscular strain is noted more frequently in the legs than elsewhere, largely because of the standing posture and to some extent because the legs are used in working the lever of the pressing machine. The arms are also -frequently the site of pain. As we shall show later, the occurrence of neuritis and occupational neuroses is more frequently among the pressers than any of the other workers. -The ailment most common to the pressers was a highly inflamed condition of the eye — conjunctivitis. Out of a total of 108 pressers, this condition was noted in 24, or 22.2 per cent. That the eye condition is directly traceable to the influence of this trade process there can be but little doubt, although it is not clear as to which factor is at fault. The eyes may be irritated by being constantly exposed to the steam vapor arising from the dampened cloth or from gas fumes escaping from a leaking tube. So far as the distribution by age groups is concerned, there is no relationship between advancing age and the frequency of this condition. -In this group, 30 in number, are the bushelman (10), the examiners (7), the cutters (7), and the foremen (6). In addition to the foreman, each shop depending on its size will contain one or more of these skilled workers. -The bushelers may be changed from one kind of work to another, or be assigned to specially fine work. Often their duty consists entirely of correcting the faults of other employees. -In the small contract shops there are no cutters, this work being done in the main factory. This is a skilled process and requires an apprenticeship and special training. Cutting may be done with shears or a knife, but as a rule a large number of thicknesses of cloth are cut at once by means of an electric power knife. Such an instrument is capable of cutting 30 or 40 thicknesses of cloth at once. -Each shop, no matter how small, has a foreman. In the small shops the foreman usually works at one of the processes in addition to his supervising duties. -Among the women is a small group of 27, composed of 7 cleaners whose duty it is to pull out the basting threads after the garment has passed through the operating or machine process, and 20 buttonhole makers. Among the latter four complained of backache. -STRUCTURAL CONDITION OF HOUSE. -SANITARY FACILITIES OF HOME.HYGIENIC CONDITION OF THE HOME.— PHYSICAL AILMENTS AND LIVING CONDITIONS.— HEALTH OF FAMILIES OF WORKERS.— COMPOSITION OF HOUSEHOLDS STUDIED.— PERSONS PER ROOM BY NATIONALITY.— PHYSICAL AILMENTS AS RELATED TO PERSONS PER ROOM.— RELATION OF INDD7IDUAL STUDIED TO HOUSEHOLD. -To show that this or that occupation is inherently harmful it is necessary to eliminate all factors which can in any way be considered as being contributory. This cannot be done unless we make a thorough study of all the circumstances relating to the worker\\'s daily life. The danger of a bad working place may be offset by excellent living conditions. On the other hand, the working place may be ideal, while the home hygiene is as bad as possible. As more than half of the worker\\'s time is spent in his home, the influence of unsanitary surroundings cannot be ignored. -And by home hygiene is meant not only the character of the home and its environment, but also the habits of the individual. To obtain data of this character is not only laborious, but it furthermore requires an infinite amount of tact and patience on the part of the investigator. In the matter of completeness we believe that the data which have been gathered in regard to these facts are unique in the study of the health aspects of a given industry. -In regard to the terms employed, namely, good, fair, and bad, to designate the living conditions, it may be said that the descriptive data of home conditions gathered in this investigation were in sufficient detail to justify the broad classification adopted. The only error which is apt to occur is in the use of the term \"fair.\" Facts recorded under this heading might in some instances more properly be designated as good, and in others as bad. -STRUCTURAL CONDITION OF HOUSE. Beginning with the character of the house itself, and estimating its good or bad qualities on the basis of furnishing adequate light, ventilation, and proper conveniences, the following results were obtained: -SANITARY FACILITIES OF THE HOME. In the following tables the housing conditions, with special reference to sanitary facilities, are summarized for the 402 male and the 341 female employees: -It is shown that 63 of the males and 101 of the females secured their water-supply from the yard. The water-closet was located in the yard in 163 instances among the males and 169 among the females. -The most noteworthy feature is the large number of privy-vaults, namely, 18.7 per cent, for the entire group studied. It is almost unbelievable that a modern city, and one proudly designated as the city of homes, would countenance the number of open privy-vaults which at present exist. Although the number has been greatly reduced within the past few years by the activities of the Philadelphia Housing Commission, it is estimated that there still remain 20,000. -In estimating the influence of housing conditions one must not lose sight of the fact that two elements are involved: (1) The good or bad character of the house itself; (2) the manner in which the people live. In another study of housing conditions made by the Phipps Institute it has been shown that in some instances the house may be rated at 100 per cent, while the living hygiene may be o per cent. In other words, it takes two factors to make a slum — bad houses and bad tenants. -The following table shows the distribution of physical ailments according to living conditions among 402 males: -When we compare the figures relating to living conditions with those relating to physical ailments, we find the following distribution: -In addition to the examination into the physical condition of the 402 males, 341 females were examined with relation to their living condition, working environment, and trade processes. -The figures as given in the table show the following distribution of physical ailments according to the living conditions of the workers: -When calculated in percentage, the relationship between living conditions and physical ailments shows the following: -The above tables show that among the males only 184, or 45.7 per cent., were living under conditions which could be considered as clean, while among the females the number of those living in clean homes was 135, or 39.6 per cent. -Among those suffering with ailments no marked difference is apparent between those classed as clean, fairly clean, and dirty. In estimating the influence of unsanitary home surroundings it must be remembered that we are dealing with people actually engaged at work, and not as yet incapacitated. It is a fair presumption that prolonged living amid unsanitary conditions does eventually affect the health adversely. This is amply borne out by the fact that the general morbidity rate is, as a rule, higher under such conditions of living. The worker who today is apparently healthy, even amidst unsanitary conditions, may in a few months show evidences of failing health. -It appears that, as far as ascertainable, the large majority of the families were in good health. The only notable finding was tuberculosis, which was -encountered in the family in 40 instances: 27, or 6.7 per cent., out of a total of 402 male employees, and 13, or 3.89 per cent., out of 341 female employees. -COMPOSITION OF HOUSEHOLDS OF WORKERS STUDIED. This aspect of the problem has been studied from a number of viewpoints. -As this table indicates, there is no evidence of marked overcrowding in the group as a whole, namely, 1.2 persons per room. In individual -The following tables show the relationship existing between physical ailments and persons per room: -It is evident from the figures, however, that this method is not productive of conclusive evidence. Out of a total of 402 male workers, 120 lived under conditions necessitating the sharing of rooms on the basis of two persons per room and over, and 25 with three persons per room and over — in other words, 20.8 per cent, of the workers lived under conditions -which may be termed crowded, and 6.2 per cent, of the same group of workers were housed under conditions which averaged three or more persons per room. -It is a significant fact, however, that among those found to have no physical ailment, one-fifth, or 6.6 per cent., of the workers were living under very crowded conditions. On the other hand, among those suffering from tuberculosis only 3.9 per cent, were living under very crowded conditions. -An analysis of the figures relating to crowding in the homes of the female workers shows the following distribution: -These figures indicate that the largest amount of crowding was found among the workers, who, from the point of view of illnesses due to trade processes, were found to be practically free from ailment. As far as this investigation is concerned, it was not possible to trace the relationship between physical ailments due to trade process and the amount of crowding. -The analysis of the figures on crowding, as related to tuberculosis, indicates that there were no female workers living under conditions of three and over persons per room, and out of a total of 21 tuberculous workers, none were living under conditions necessitating a very serious amount of crowding. -Having considered the home environment both as to actual standards of sanitation and hygiene and intensity of room use from the point of view of crowding, there is little evidence pointing to the relation of these conditions to physical ailments which may be classified as \"occupational ailments.\" -The criticism made regarding unsanitary living conditions also holds good in respect to overcrowding. While those living under overcrowded conditions were apparently healthy at the time of investigation, it does not -alter the fact that such conditions are not compatible with health. To show the effect of overcrowding, if persisted in, on this particular group would necessitate a study of their health several years hence. A sufficiently large number of studies on the relationship existing between overcrowding and morbidity have been made already, and the data thus obtained points conclusively to the fact that such a relationship does exist. -As in the case of the men, room congestion is not a marked feature when the average for the entire group is taken, namely, 1.4 persons per room. -It is, therefore, seen that the females were living under conditions which made it necessary for 140 women to live in 100 rooms, while in the case of the males there were only 120 persons per 100 rooms. -With the growth of this industry and the migration of labor from one center to another has come a problem of housing persons living away from their families. In this city the problem has reached large proportions and constitutes a serious social problem. Rooming houses or lodging places are resorted to largely by this class of the population, and a proper regulation of these boarding places should receive the attention of the community both locally, and, as it affects immigration, nationally. -In this particular study the most serious evils — serious in relation to hygiene, sanitation, and morality — were found in the tenements and small separate rooms, where groups of men \"kept house\" together. The conditions of living are the lowest possible, precluding even the common decencies of life. -These tables show that 103 of the male workers examined lived in private families as lodgers; in other words, 25.2 per cent, of these workers were living away from their families. -In the case of the females, 84, or 24.6 per cent., of the workers were living with families other than their own. On the other hand, 87, or 25.5 per cent., of the families visited kept lodgers and boarders. -Under conditions where lodgers and boarders are kept the privacy of the family life is seriously interfered with. The average number of persons in the families with lodgers was 8.5 per cent, in the case of the families with female workers, and in the case of the males the average size of the family is 8.2 per cent. The average size of all the families visited was 5.7 per cent, in the case of the males, and 6.3 per cent, in the case of the females. These figures would seem to indicate that the female workers live under somewhat more crowded conditions than the males, and that the taking of boarders or lodgers helps to increase congestion. -NOURISHMENT.— RELATION OF PHYSICAL AILMENTS TO NOURISHMENT —AMOUNT OF SLEEP— RELATION OF PHYSICAL AILMENTS TO SLEEP.— USE OF ALCOHOL. -There is no phase of industrial life which is more important than the food question. It is almost axiomatic that health cannot be maintained or the strain of overwork compensated for unless the individual is properly fed. The prudent man feeds his horses regularly, and the harder he works them, the more oats he gives them. The human worker, on the other hand, is often indifferently fed in one of three ways: either he is irregular in his habits of eating, or he eats an insufficient amount, or he eats a poor quality of food. -In the following tables it will be noted that a record has been made as to whether the meals were regular or irregular, and also as to whether or not they were nourishing. -Among the males the percentage of those whose meals were irregular or both irregular and not nourishing is 23.3 per cent.; among the females it was 20.5 per cent. -RELATION OF PHYSICAL AILMENTS TO NOURISHMENT. The following tables show the relationship which exists between insufficient food and ailments attributable to the trade. -Thus of the total number of males (402), 58.6 per cent, of those with insufficient food had some ailment as compared to 34.3 per cent, who had sufficient food. Among 341 women, 32.3 per cent, with insufficient food suffered from some ailment, while only 15. 1 per cent, of those with sufficient food were similarly affected. -From these figures it is reasonable to assume that lack of proper food must have a decided influence on the production of fatigue and the lowering of the individual\\'s resistance. And this seems to be borne out by the figures relating to tuberculosis. -Among the males getting insufficient food, 18.5 had evidence of tuberculous infection, while of those getting sufficient food, the percentage was 1 1. 4. -Among the females the difference is even more marked, the figures being 17.7 per cent, for those with insufficient and 3.9 per cent, for those with sufficient food. -In looking over the diets of the workers one is struck by the want of variety in foods in most of the households. -The lunches as seen in the factories at noon hour consisted of sandwiches poorly prepared of sausage, bologna, or cold fried eggs, cucumbers, not even prepared, fruit frequently unripe, occasionally milk for the women, frequently beer for the men. In the households bread, meat, soup, and potatoes — among the Italians, macaroni, of course, and among the Russians, salt herring and tea — constitute the principal articles of diet. -Since the working capacity of the individual depends upon his nourishment, an abundance of cheap and good food is one of the essentials for a productive working class. -Special attention was given to the matter of nourishment in this study, and in most cases the chief faults to be found were with the want of variety, previously mentioned, and the irregularity of eating. It is not an uncommon thing for a worker to leave his home early in the morning without food and later take a lunch of simply bread and butter at the factory. -The observations made in this study point to the necessity for instructing the large body of workers in the choice, selection, and preparation of foods and encourage the hope that the teaching of the value of different foods and a training in marketing and cooking in schools may have an influence in the future. -This has a very important relationship to the individual\\'s health. It is not possible, except for short periods, for the worker to render proper service, on the one hand, or, on the other, to maintain health without the proper amount of sleep. \"Burning the candle at both ends\" may be ac-complished by undue hours of work, such as occur during the rush periods of the trade, or it may result from the worker staying up unduly late because of pleasure. In the following tables are recorded the average number of hours each worker believed he obtained. It is generally assumed that eight hours out of the twenty-four should be devoted to sleep. For the young working adult this is almost a necessity; among the older individuals less sleep is needed, as a rule. In the appended tables it will be noted that a very considerable number of those in the age groups 15-19 and 20-24 a dmitted to six or seven hours only. -It will also be noted that the bed-room was dark and incapable of proper ventilation in 40 instances — 16 among the males and 24 among the females. -In the above table it is to be noted that among the males not obtaining sufficient sleep 41.9 per cent, suffered from some ailment, as compared to 36.9 per cent, in which sufficient sleep was obtained. -Among the females the difference is very marked — 33.4 per cent, with insufficient sleep having an ailment as compared to 12.9 per cent, having an ailment with sufficient sleep. -Among the males the percentage of those with a tuberculous lesion having a sufficient and an insufficient amount of sleep is the same; among the females 13 per cent, with insufficient sleep had a lesion as compared to 4.5 per cent, with sufficient sleep. -Both the table on nutrition and that on sleep indicate that women are less resistant than men when food and sleep are insufficient. -The important bearing that these figures have upon the effect of work upon the health of the workers can hardly be overestimated. They point to the need for the extension of \"industrial hygiene\" into the home, a matter as difficult to attain and quite as frequently neglected as the conditions that are permitted to exist within the factory itself, whether dependent upon the employer or the employee. -The relation between personal hygiene, as shown by the figures dealing with nutrition and sleep, and the trade processes, with their influence upon the health of the worker, are inseparable, and point out the need for correlating personal and industrial hygiene. -To determine whether an individual uses alcohol to excess is extremely difficult. For the most part it depends on the individual questioned. While some freely admit to the excessive use of alcohol, the majority who use it will never admit that they are more than moderate users, although they may really be drinking to excess. The immoderate moderate drinker is very frequently met with. -In this study every individual was questioned as to whether alcohol was used. For the most part the data obtained are open to the criticism mentioned above. In one group, however, the admission as to excessive use seemed to be clearly substantiated. Among the Lithuanians the free use of alcohol in the form of gin and whisky was admitted frankly by many, and that there was every reason to believe this was apparent by its use at meal-time. -RELATION OF EARNING CAPACITY TO FACTORY CONDITIONS— WAGES OF OPERATORS— WAGES OF PRESSERS— WAGES OF BASTERS AND FINISHERS—COMPARISON OF WAGES PAID TO MEN AND TO WOMEN— INFLUENCE OF ENFORCED IDLENESS AND OVERTIME WORK.— HOURS OF WORK PER WEEK— PIECE WORK AND WAGE WORK.— VACATIONS.— SECONDARY EMPLOYMENT.— INSURANCE. -The manufacture of clothing allows of an extreme division of labor in the production of every garment. At the same time the various operations involved in the making of a coat, a vest, or a pair of pants do not stand out distinctly, and may be merged and performed by a single individual. -The needle, the sewing-machine, the pressing iron, and the shears are the chief implements of the garment-workers\\' trade. These tools indicate the primary division of labor into machine operators, hand-sewers, pressers, and trimmers or finishers, and for the purpose of this study this broad classification has been used. -In most industries the experience of years of work in a particular trade tends to increase the earning capacity of the worker. This is generally affected by conditions of the market, whether or not the trade is seasonal, the physical condition of the worker, and the method of pay in use — piece work or weekly wage. -These statistics of earning were collected under different conditions of industrial activity. Naturally, the earnings of employees were affected in varying degrees by lack of work or abundance of opportunities for employment. An accurate record of time worked for all employees was unfortunately not obtainable for any but time workers, and since payment by the piece is widely prevalent, it is a matter of serious inconvenience that many shops keep no record of hours. Likewise the employment of women beyond legal hours during irregular periods or at odd times is difficult to determine, as they do not remember how much or in what way overtime was worked by them. -It is not an uncommon thing for workers to begin their day at 3 A. m. during the rush season, and end at 7 p. m. One tailor testified that he knew many men who worked during the busy season six days and three nights in the same week, and that he had repeatedly seen men work thirty-six hours without any interruption or sleep or hardly any time to take their meals. Moreover, these long hours are much more exhausting now than they were twenty years ago, owing to the increased speed and exertion. -Wages vary enormously, frequently with no apparent reason but the greater or less need of the workers and their greater or less ability as bargainers. In one workshop several different prices for precisely the same work were found. -The rate of wages for piece work during the year 191 2-13, which was furnished by the superintendent of a large factory in this city, is shown in the following table: -Individually, however, for each process the rate is more finely subdivided; thus a vest finisher is paid from eight to ten cents per vest. Her output varies in rush season from fifteen to twenty vests per diem. -The three main subdivisions of the garment-making industry are operating, pressing, and basting and finishing. These three divisions represent the great majority of the workers, and a study of their wages gives a fairly representative picture of the trade as a whole. The other subdivisions are each represented by a very few skilled workers, who in some instances are paid a high wage (cutters, bushelmen), or by those who are paid a small wage for unskilled work (cleaners, button-sewers). -Taking each of the three main processes, we find the following distribution according to earning capacity and the sanitary condition of the factory: -When we come to analyze the relationship between the type of workingplace and the wages paid we find that, of 200 male operators, 60 are employed in good factories and 140 in places classed as bad. In other words, the workman is influenced in his choice of a working-place not by the character of the shop, but by other considerations, as we shall show later. In the good factory the largest group is comprised of those receiving from $5 to $9 per week; while in the poor factory the largest group is made up of those receiving from $10 to $19 per week. Among those earning $20 and over the percentage is higher also in the poorer type of workshop. -That the experience of the worker has a decided influence in determining the wage is shown in the above table. From this it is seen that 42.6 per cent, of those working in the good factories have had a trade experience of four years or less. On the other hand, in the poorer shops only 27.6 per cent, had a trade life of four years or less. As the trade life extends the number of workers with years of experience is found to be greater constantly in the poorer as contrasted with the good shop. -The charts relating to the female operators illustrate the influence that experience has on the worker\\'s choice very clearly. Inasmuch as the trade life of the females is much shorter than the males, and also because the beginners predominate in the large factory, more females are employed in the good than in the bad type factory. Although even in this small group the percentage of those with years of experience is higher in the,bad than in the good type factory. -WAGES OF PRESSERS. This group is composed entirely of males — 108 in all. The following tables show the relationship between the wages and the character of the work-place and also the relationship between the length of the trade life and the character of the work-place: -The table on p. 67 shows a slightly larger proportion of those making a small wage in the good factory, while of those making $15 or over per week the larger proportion is to be found in the poor type of working-place. \\' -The above table shows the distribution according to trade life; while there is a slight excess of those making $15 per week or over in the bad factory, it is not marked. -Among pressers there does not seem to be the same discrimination in favor of the poor place as was found in the case of the male operators. -This group is composed principally of women, numbering 266, while the men are 62 in number. The following table shows the wages earned in the good and bad type of factory, and the length of the trade life among the males. Except for those earning $20 or over per week, the bad factory is represented by a slightly higher percentage in those earning over $10 per week. -In the table showing the length of the trade life it will be seen that those with a trade experience of fifteen years or more predominate in the bad type of factory. -WAGES AND TRADE LIFE AS RELATED TO FACTORY CONDITIONS. 69 DISTRIBUTION OF WORKERS ACCORDING TO LENGTH OF TRADE LIFE. -In considering the female basters and finishers we note again, in comparing them with the males, the discrepancy in the earning capacity of the two sexes. While some of the males are able to earn $20 or more per week, the extreme limit noted for women was $14. A second point to be noted is the length of the trade life among the females: after nine years\\' experience -the number diminishes rapidly, whereas among the males the majority had an experience of ten years or more. -Owing to the relatively short time the women remain in the trade, the distribution in the good and bad type of factory is more uniform. But even here the bad factory has a higher representation both as to those paid the highest wage and those with the longer trade experience. -Owing to the limited number of people employed in the other trade processes, it would not be advisable to draw any general conclusion from their distribution as indicated by the data gathered in this inquiry. -The question naturally arises, why is the large wage paid to those working in the poorer type of factory? In the first place, much of the work is paid for by the piece, and the more the worker accomplishes the more he is paid. Experience counts for a great deal in the ability of the worker to produce sufficient work to obtain a high wage, and as the table on p. 69 shows, the number with years of experience is greater in the poor than in the good type of factory. In addition the small shop offers more opportunity for overtime work because of less stringent rules. -The reason that the experienced worker seeks employment in the poor type of shop is to some extent because he chafes at the discipline imposed in the large factory. Many workers have testified to this, stating that they would not work in a place in which the rules were strict in regards to the time of reporting in the morning and leaving at night. Smoking, which almost invariably prevails in the smaller shops, is, of course, absolutely prohibited in the large factories. Another personal factor also is the relationship which exists between the boss in the small shop and the foreman in the large factory. In the case of the former all are co-workers, and the boss is not considered as a taskmaster to the same degree as is the foreman. Furthermore, in the large, well-organized factory there are less opportunity and need for overtime work because of the larger number of workers employed. Thus, as the worker gains in experience he seeks a place which is to him congenial. And while many do serve their apprenticeship in the poorer places, by far the larger number enter the trade in the large factory. -That no very material difference in the average wage of the three most important group of workers exists is well shown in the charts II and III. In addition, these charts show very clearly the wide differences between the wages of the two sexes. -tributed among three of the processes, namely, operating, pressing, and basting and finishing. Among the males the workers designated under one or the other of these headings constitute 91 per cent, of the 402 males studied; among the females, 89.2 per cent, of 341 are employed in one of two processes, operating and basting and finishing. -As is graphically shown in the charts on page 71, the average weekly wage for men in the three main processes is essentially the same — $13.42 for the operator, $13.23 for the presser, and $13.42 for the baster and finisher. This wage for the particular individual is more or less dependent on experience, driving power, and age. -For women doing the same work the operator is paid $7.59 per week, as compared to $13.42 for the male; the female baster and finisher $6.95, as compared to $13.42 for the male. -The highest wage paid among the men, namely, $29.29 to foremen, needs no comment. And the same may be said of the wages paid to bushelmen and examiners. The number of employees involved is very small, and in both instances they represent skilled and experienced individuals. -The only process in which the female wage exceeds that of the male was in buttonhole making, and in this division the number of males (2) offers no basis for comparison. -In comparing the wages for age groups it is seen that the earnings of the male gradually increase up to forty-four years of age, when they begin to decline. This is probably due to a loss of efficiency caused by advancing age and the warping of faculties of initiative through the limitations of an habitual trade process. -Among the females the earnings for the different age groups differ very slightly, the maximum wages being paid in the age group from twenty to twenty-four years. Instead of rising, the earnings for the succeeding years are less, reaching the minimum at the forty-fifth year of age. -The average wage per week of the entire group of women is $7.11, as compared to $14.41 for the men. -The only adequate explanation that can be given is that the superior physique of the male and his longer experience in the trade enable him to accomplish more work. Doubtless, too, this trade does not differ from other industries in which men and women competing on an equal basis are unequally paid. -INFLUENCE OF ENFORCED IDLENESS AND OVERTIME WORK. Earlier in the report we called attention to the seasonal character of the trade. Early in the summer and early in the winter there is a lull in the industry, and during these periods the majority of the workers are either laid off entirely or work part time only. The following tables show the amount of enforced idleness during the year. The figures for both the males and females are pretty evenly distributed. -About one-fifth of each sex had steady employment all the year round — 19.65 per cent, males and 20.52 per cent, females. Nearly one-half of each sex were without work from two to four weeks; 14.17 per cent, males and 12.61 per cent, females were idle from four to six weeks, and 13.89 per cent, of the males and 11.72 per cent, of the females were idle two months or longer. When one considers that even when working at full time the great majority receive little more than a bare living wage, it becomes apparent that a complete cessation of work for a period much beyond two weeks is a serious matter. -HOURS OF WORK PER WEEK. Another bad feature of the trade, and one that results from the seasonal character of the work, is the fact that each period of slackness is followed by one of feverish activity. Partly because the worker wishes to make up what his enforced idleness has cost him and partly because rush orders hurry the manufacturers, overtime work is a fairly common practice, and this occurs most frequently in the poorer type of shop. While there is a law limiting the hours per week for females, namely 54, this is often exceeded. -Among the males it is to be noted that the distribution between those working for a weekly wage and those paid by the piece is practically the same, although as the trade life lengthens those doing piece work are in the majority. -Among the females those working for a weekly wage are in the majority in the age group 15-19, but for every age group beyond this those paid by the piece predominate. -Overtime work prevails only during the rush season, and, as a rule, after such a period the worker is laid off or works part time only. -Among the males 59.4 per cent, worked overtime. The amount of overtime work done by the wage group is slightly in excess of the piece workers, while among the females, 44.7 per cent, of whom worked overtime, the piece workers do the most overtime work. The average amount of overtime work for both sexes is about the same, namejy, about five hours per week for the wage workers and a little over four hours for the piece workers. It should be borne in mind that the legal limit for women is fifty-four hours, and that this was exceeded in 44.7 per cent, of the 330 women investigated. -Among the males there were 21 instances in which overtime work was notably excessive, namely, from sixty-five to seventy-nine hours per week. -Among the females there were 13 instances in which from sixty to seventy-four hours\\' work was done. -VACATIONS. Among the working class the taking of a voluntary vacation during the summer months is not a common practice. The margin between income and the necessities of life is entirely too small to admit of this. In this particular trade there is already too much enforced idleness to admit of many taking a voluntary rest. Still, even among these people a small proportion was noted in which a vacation was taken — among the 402 males, 46 (11.4 per cent.), and among the 341 females, 44 (12.9 per cent.). -The following tables show the number who follow a secondary occupation, and also the character of work done. Among the men 344, or 85.5 per cent., did nothing aside from their regular employment, while 58, or 14.5 per cent., were engaged in some other pursuit after working hours. It is interesting to note that 32, or 7.9 per cent., regularly attended night school. -Among the women there is a striking difference when compared to the men — only 84, or 24.7 per cent., were idle after working hours, while 257, or 75.3 per cent., did work of some kind in addition to labor performed in the shop or factory. For the most part the extra labor consisted of housework done on their return home in the evenings. It is to be noted, in addition, that 40, or 14.6 per cent., did sewing, and 29, or 8.5 per cent., attended night school. -The protection of trie workers against death, illness, old age, and unemployment is among the most serious of industrial problems that we have in this country. The extent of private insurance, while an indication of a consciousness among the workers of the need for self-protection and the protection of family, represents frequently only an insignificant asset, since the amounts in policies are barely sufficient to cover the cost of a serious illness or burial. The frequency of insurance, therefore, among workers does not actually represent adequate protection against the hazard of work and the unexpected problems arising out of illness and unemployment, whether due to causes for which the worker may or may not be responsible. -The above figures show that the frequency of insurance is 59.2 per cent, among the males as against 22 per cent, among the females. Information concerning the amount of insurance was very difficult to obtain and could not be relied upon. -The following tables indicate the kinds of insurance prevailing among the male and female workers studied: -DISTRIBUTION OF 402 EMPLOYEES IN THE PHILADELPHIA CLOTHING INDUSTRY BY ADDITIONAL KINDS OF INSURANCE CARRIED. -In the case of the males it was found that 56.71 per cent, carried life insurance and 51.26 carried sickness insurance. The amount of accident and unemployment insurance was negligible. -In the case of the females it was found that 21.9 per cent, carried life insurance and 3.2 per cent, carried sickness insurance. It is true that this failure of female workers to carry insurance is due in part to a lack of responsibility for the welfare of others; but the chief reason is that thenwages are lower and payment means more in proportion to income. The fact, too, that they are not a constant factor in industry affects the interest in insurance. -The fact that 85.8 per cent, of all the male insurance is carried in fraternal orders shows the strong element of race in building up these organizations. -Perhaps no better evidence is possible of the necessity of sick insurance and of its recognition by the American workers than the growing prevalence of sick benefits among the trade unions, which are, after all, organized for a very different purpose. -Throughout the experience of this study the workers anxiously questioned what would become of those found ill and incapacitated for work, and their alarm was communicated to the investigator, who was made to realize the need to understand that a sickness insurance law, even in one state, can do more to eradicate poverty, and is, therefore a greater social gain, than a dozen organizations for scientific philanthropy. -UNSANITARY FACTORY CONDITIONS— EFFECT OF WORK ITSELF.— WAGES.— LIVING ENVIRONMENT OF WORKERS: CHARACTER OF NEIGHBORHOOD; CHARACTER OF HOME; TUBERCULOSIS IN FAMILY; FOOD; SLEEP. -It may be stated at the outset that there is nothing about the occupation of garment making that is of itself conducive to tuberculosis. This occupation is one of many which are credited with being bad, but which in reality are not, much of the evil that is associated with them being the result of contributory factors which are not directly connected with the work itself. That many who follow the tailoring trade develop tuberculosis there can be no doubt, but as we shall show later, nearly all the factors which are held responsible for the disease involve, in one way or another, a large number of these workers. -In the present study 51 of the 402 males and 21 of 341 females were classed as being tuberculous. According to the figures shown below, the trade process does not seem to have any marked influence. The distribution was as follows: -In considering these figures it must be understood that they do not represent active tuberculosis of the lungs. With but few exceptions the individuals classed as having tuberculosis showed abnormal signs at one apex, such as diminished expansion, impairment on percussion, or abnormal breath-sounds. As is well known, these signs may occur in cases of incipient tuberculosis or in cases in which the disease is arrested, the activity having subsided years before. Based on physical signs alone, a distinction between the two cannot be made. In the absence of any symptoms it is assumed that the process is arrested. Such a lesion may, of course, become active at any time, and one is safe in saying that an individual with such -abnormal signs in the chest is in more danger of becoming definitely tuberculous than one whose chest is normal. -It would be impossible to state how many of these individuals had had latent trouble years before, or how many were just about to break down. -Inasmuch as the weight both for the different age periods and for the entire group was the average among the males, and slightly above the average for the females, it can be assumed that the tuberculosis was for the most part arrested or inactive. -The occurrence of cases of this type serves to emphasize the necessity of periodical examination of employees. By doing this the first evidences of the disease could be detected, and to the doubtful ones proper instructions for safeguarding their health could be given. The permanent arrest of tuberculosis is obtained, as a rule, in cases in which the disease is in its very incipiency. This is especially true among the working classes, who have no opportunity of sparing themselves on their return to work. When the disease becomes self-evident, its arrest is a difficult matter, and fatal relapses are only too prone to occur when work is resumed. Furthermore, in the case that is at the most suspicious the simplest precautions as to the mode of life are often all that is necessary, while active, manifest disease means enforced rest for an indefinite period. -In order to determine the morbidity rate among garment workers the records of three general hospitals were examined. Out of a total of 32,211 records examined, it was found that 1152, or 3.5 per cent., were garment makers. Of this number 916 were males and 236 were females. Tuberculosis was present in 7.3 per cent, of the males and in 4.7 per cent, of the females. -In addition to studying the records of the hospitals near at hand, letters were sent to all the principal sanatoria and tuberculosis hospitals of the country, asking for the number of garment workers treated during the past five years. The replies received covered a period of from one to seven years. Aside from several large city hospitals and five institutions to be specially mentioned, the average number of garment workers in these institutions was about 3 per cent. -Jewish Consumption Relief Society, Denver ... (7 years) 31.09 \" \" Workmen\\'s Circle, Liberty, New York (1 year ) 40.36 \" \" -old belief that the Jew enjoyed an immunity to tuberculosis has been pretty thoroughly dispelled since that race has become a part of modern industrial life and the city slum. In the five institutions dealing exclusively with Jews it is to be noted that from one-fifth to nearly one-half of the patients are garment workers. This fact taken by itself would indicate a tremendous morbidity rate for the trade. But when we recall that nearly three-fourths of the male and one-third of the female garment makers are Jewish, it becomes apparent that this occupation is followed by a larger number of the race than is any other line of work, and hence will have a very high representation. The same results were shown in the figures relating to the general hospitals of Philadelphia. Of the garment workers seeking relief for diseases of all kinds, 81.4 per cent, of the males and 79.3 per cent, of the females were Jewish. -An analysis of 6894 cases of tuberculosis — 4139 males and 2755 females — treated at the dispensary and hospital of the Henry Phipps Institute from February 1, 1903, to February 1, 1912, shows that 434, or 10.9 per cent, of males, and 191, or 6.9 per cent, of females, were engaged in the clothing industry. During the first seven years of this period the Institute received patients from all over the city of Philadelphia and the adjacent vicinity. Since the fall of 1910 patients have been taken from a restricted area which contains a large proportion of the Jewish population of the city. For the year 1913 a positive diagnosis of tuberculosis was made in 685 new patients; of this number 14 per cent, were garment makers. -In other words, any institution which treats a large number of Jews, no matter what the complaint is, will have a very high proportion of garment workers for the reason that the majority of the race are so employed. -UNSANITARY FACTORY CONDITIONS. If the worker\\'s trade life was confined to one factory or to several factories of the same type, we would be in a position to form a fairly accurate judgment as to the effect the sanitary condition of the shop had on the health of the employees. That this can rarely be done in the individual case is due to the fact that the workers shift from factory to factory — sometimes from a bad to a good one, and vice versa. Any one who has been in the trade for any length of time, however, is apt to have been subjected to all sorts of sanitary conditions. In the group which we have studied it was found at the time of the investigation that the ventilation was open to criticism in 19 of 43 of the shops; there were no wash-rooms in 39, and in 34 the toilets were either unsanitary or unclean. Cuspidors were provided in but 2 of the 43 shops. In the majority of the workshops there was little -evidence of any attempt at cleanliness, especially in unused portions of the room, where very often the dirt and rubbish evidently represented the accumulation of months. -We encountered but one instance in which the evidence was direct that tuberculosis might be transmitted from worker to worker in the shop itself. This was a small contract shop consisting of six workers. The presser had advanced tuberculosis with cavity formation. Investigation of the corner in which he worked showed that he. constantly expectorated on the floor. -Anything which lowers the individual resistance may cause to become active a tuberculous focus which was implanted years before. In this way certain occupations may play a part if the work is arduous in character, if the hours are unduly long, or if the work is carried on amid unsanitary conditions. -Garment making may be made arduous if the worker has to work at top speed. This is usually recognized as one of the bad features of the trade, and is most noticeable among the operators. Work carried on in this way leads to fatigue, and if this occurs constantly, may impair the individual\\'s vitality. -Working unduly long hours may bring about the same results. For women fifty-four hours per week are prescribed by law as the limit. In spite of this, however, we found that 148 out of 330 women employed in the factories worked overtime — four hours and fifty-four minutes for those paid a weekly wage and four hours and eighteen minutes for those doing piece work. Among the men the figures were nearly the same — four hours and forty-three minutes for the wage workers and four hours and four minutes for the piece workers. As the trade is seasonal in character, the hours per week during the rush season often greatly exceed these figures. In this way six weeks or two months of excessively long hours working at top speed could readily produce a breakdown in health. -very frequently when it is sufficient it is earned at the expense of great labor, while during the dull season the worker is either laid off entirely or works part time. As a result of this the wage per week varies greatly. Entirely apart from the uncertainty of what the wage per week will be, there is no doubt that the worker\\'s health would be less endangered if the work were evenly distributed throughout the year. -(a) Character of the Neighborhood. — We have shown that the length of the trade life of the workers studied coincided almost exactly with the length of time they had lived in this country. This means that the workers are recruited almost entirely from the newly arrived immigrants. These people, particularly the Jews, land with little or no money, and as a result are forced to seek the cheapest and poorest quarters of the city. From the very beginning of their trade life, therefore, they live amid unsanitary conditions. Later, if they prosper, they move to better localities, but for the majority at all times the neighborhood environment is apt to be bad. The fact that both the morbidity and mortality rates of tuberculosis are always highest in such localities needs no comment. -(b) Character of Home. — The type of house occupied by the 402 males was classed as poor and lacking in the proper sanitary facilities in 72 instances (17.9 per cent.). Among 341 females the home was classed as being structurally bad in 101 instances (29.6 per cent.). -As to hygiene of the people themselves, 184 of 402 males (45.7 per cent.) were classed as clean; among 341 females the percentage was 39.6 per cent. -In regard to overcrowding we find that the 51 male cases with abnormal signs in the lungs show the following distribution: less than 2 persons per room, 13.3 per cent.; 2 and less than 3 per room, 12.5 per cent.; and 3 and over per room, 8 per cent. -Among 21 females there were less than 2 per room in 4 per cent., and 2 and less than 3 per room in 7.8 per cent. There was no instance of 3 or more per room among the females. -While the data relating to housing conditions does not indicate a specific influence on the occurrence of tuberculosis in this group, they do point to a large proportion of unsanitary conditions which must, in the long run, bring about a deterioration in health. -(c) Tuberculosis in Family. — So far as this group is concerned, tuberculosis in other members of the family was encountered in 27, or 6.7 per cent, of the 402 males, and 13, or 3.8 per cent., of the females. The question of whether the worker is exposed to the disease in the home or has a family -history of tuberculosis is extremely important. When such is the case, it would be difficult to fasten the blame on the occupation. During the year 1913 there were treated in the Phipps Institute Dispensary 685 cases with a positive diagnosis of tuberculosis, and of this number 96, or 14 per cent., were garment-makers. Twenty-seven, or 28 per cent., of the 96 had a family history of tuberculosis. Furthermore, the social histories of patients with tuberculosis but following an occupation other than that of garment-making showed that in 108 instances one or more members of the family were employed as garment makers. It is thus seen that the worker is often exposed to the danger of infection in the home. -(d) Food. — In the figures relating to the question of food it was found that among the males 18.5 per cent, of those getting insufficient food had a tuberculous lesion, while of sufficiently fed only 11.4 per cent, had a lesion. -Among the females 17.7 per cent, insufficiently fed had a lesion, while of those getting sufficient food only 3.9 per cent, had a lesion. -(e) Sleep. — The amount of sleep obtained had no apparent difference so far as the males were concerned, the percentage being 12.7 per cent, for sufficient and 12.5 per cent, for insufficient. Among the females, however, there was a marked difference, a pulmonary lesion being present in 13 per cent, of those with insufficient, compared to 4.5 per cent, getting sufficient, sleep. -(/) In considering the question of intemperance we pointed out the difficulty of estimating an excessive use of alcohol from the worker\\'s word alone. To what extent alcoholism has a bearing on the incidence of tuberculosis in this industry is problematical. -EXPERIENCE OF FATIGUE ACCORDING TO TIME OF DAY— RELATION OF FATIGUE TO AGE OF WORKERS— RELATION OF FATIGUE TO TRADE PROCESS.— RELATION OF FATIGUE TO NATIONALITY AND NUMBER OF HOURS\\' WORK PER DAY.— EVIDENCES OF FATIGUE AS SHOWN IN HOSPITAL AND DISPENSARY RECORDS. -In considering the subject of fatigue as related to the garment-making industry, it is necessary to realize that we are dealing with a condition that admits of measurement only with the greatest difficulty. The present teaching regarding fatigue is that overuse of a muscle or group of muscles results in the accumulation of waste-products and the consumption of energy-yielding substances, such as glycogen and oxygen. These chemical changes are brought about by stimulation of the muscle. The more prolonged the stimulation, the greater the chemical change, until finally the muscle fails to respond at all. The loss of vigor in the contraction corresponds to the beginning of fatigue, the latter increasing and passing finally into exhaustion if the stimulation is continued sufficiently long. Furthermore, the accumulation of waste products and the consumption of substances essential for activity react on the nervous system, with the result that impulses are imperfectly transmitted from the brain to the muscles. These observations, while for the most part the result of laboratory investigation, have been shown to be true also for muscular exertion, as encountered in the performance of various occupations. Assuming that the individual is physiologically sound, and that he starts the day well rested from the previous day\\'s labor, the degree of fatigue experienced at the end of the day will necessarily vary for each individual. Work, as Dejerine has well put it, consists of four parts: (i) The getting started. (2) The automatic performance of the task. An individual in good physical condition who is thoroughly familiar with his work and who, in addition, has an interest in his task, practically works automatically. Brain and muscle are perfectly co-ordinated, and the work is done without conscious effort. (3) Voluntary effort. After a variable time the worker becomes conscious of his work, and this is probably the first evidence of fatigue. Work under these circumstances can be done efficiently and without harm. If persisted in, however, the fatigue becomes more and more pronounced, until (4) the stage of exhaustion is reached. -While muscular fatigue can be produced under the most favorable conditions, the tendency to fatigue increases in proportion to the number of unfavorable factors associated with the work or the life of the worker. These unfavorable factors are of three kinds: (1) Those related to the work itself, such as speed, piece work, overtime, monotony, and the noise of machinery. (2) Those related to the working environment, such as faulty ventilation, which leads to undue heat and humidity; faulty lighting, which induces eye-strain and headaches; and bad sanitary conditions in or about the working-place. (3) The physical status and habits of the worker. This phase of the subject has not received the attention it deserves. It must be obvious to any one, however, that an individual in poor physical condition will succumb to fatigue sooner than the one who is healthy. It must be equally obvious that the individual who is poorly fed, who gets insufficient rest, and who lives amid bad sanitary conditions will become a victim to fatigue sooner than the worker of whom the reverse is true. And if to these factors dissipation is added to the list, the deterioration of working efficiency is inevitable. -It must be remembered that this trade is one in which each group of workers is engaged in a single operation. This is paid for by the piece, or if a fixed weekly wage is paid, a certain amount of work must be performed. In both cases \" speeding up \" is a common practice : in one instance, to earn as much as possible, in the other, to accomplish a fixed task. That fatigue can be produced by the frequent repetition of a given movement or series of movements has been proved in the physiological laboratory. A realization of what this means in this industry must be apparent to any one who has witnessed the almost ceaseless rapidity with which the woman finisher or baster plys her needle or the operator sews sleeve after sleeve into coats. The number of times a day, week in and week out, that this same series of movements is repeated must produce fatigue if the relatively brief laboratory experiments can produce the condition. -In each case an effort was made to ascertain whether fatigue was experienced, and if present, the time of day when it was first noted. -These factors are correlated with those of race, age, sex, trade process, and working hours per diem. -EXPERIENCE OF FATIGUE ACCORDING TO TIME OF DAY. Of the 402 males studied, the experience of fatigue according to time of day was distributed as follows: -Among the men, fatigue is encountered most frequently as the working hours lengthen. Among the females the figures for the middle and the end of the day are practically the same. -RELATION OF FATIGUE TO AGE OF WORKER. The following tables show the relationship existing between the time of the fatigue and the age of the individual: -It will be noted that among the males fatigue is encountered most frequently up to the thirty-fifth year. For some reason the age group 25-34 shows the highest percentage. The high incidence of fatigue at this period among the males is not easy to explain. A possible assumption is that the great majority of the males are operators and pressers; the former process involves speeding up and the latter is laborious work, and in addition the workers are on their feet all day. As we shall show later, the pressers are more subject to fatigue than the others. -Among the females the table shows clearly that the younger the worker, the higher the percentage of fatigue. Thus in the age group 15-19 nearly one-half suffer from fatigue. This is not surprising, and quite what one would expect in young girls, many of whom are far from robust on entering the trade. -RELATION OF FATIGUE TO TRADE PROCESS. The following tables show the relation of fatigue to the trade process: -These tables are interesting as they show that among the males the pressers are most subject to fatigue. This is due in part to the laborious character of the work, and in part to the fact that the workers are on their feet all day. We shall point out later that occupational neuroses seem to be more prevalent among the workers in their trade process than among the others. -Next to the pressers the operators show the highest percentage of fatigue. This is due doubtless to \"speeding up,\" which is more noticeable in this process than in any of the others. -Among the women there is no noticeable difference in percentage. But if we consider the total number showing fatigue, we find that a little over one-half of those employed in each process experience fatigue. Inasmuch as the table relating to age and fatigue showed that the majority of those who tired from the work were among the young girls, it would seem that age rather than the trade process was the important element in determining fatigue among the women. -RELATION OF FATIGUE TO NATIONALITY AND NUMBER OF HOURS\\' WORK PER DAY. The following tables show the distribution of fatigue according to the nationality, and also the influence that the number of hours\\' work per day has on its production: -Although the numbers are not large, it is interesting to note that among those working nine hours or less instances of fatigue are much less frequent than in the groups working for a longer period. Thus, of 31 males and 8 females working eleven to twelve hours, nearly all suffered from fatigue. -The great majority of the workers were employed from nine to ten hours a day. As a race, the Lithuanians, both males and females, seemed to be the least affected. -In addition to ailments which seemed to be attributable to the trade itself, it was found that muscular strain was complained of by 78 of the 402 males and 47 of the 341 females intensively studied. Headache was noted among 43 of the males and 95 of the females. -The hospital records, already alluded to in a previous part of the report, also revealed some interesting data relating to fatigue. The condition most frequently encountered was neurasthenia. After giving due allowance to the laxity which prevails in the use of this term, and the large percentage of Jews represented among the patients, it is a reasonable supposition that in a great many instances the diagnosis was correct if the term neurasthenia can be used to imply nervous exhaustion. The condition was noted as having occurred in 147 of 916 males (16.2 per cent.), and in 90 of 236 females (38.2 per cent.). It is more than likely that among those who complain, from time to time, of muscular strain, headache, etc., while at work, the condition, in many instances, develops into nervous exhaustion sufficiently marked to be designated neurasthenia. It is claimed by some -that an occupational neurasthenia is not of infrequent occurrence, and that the nervous exhaustion can usually be shown to be due to some trade process. In many instances either the trade process itself predisposes to fatigue or the conditions under which the work is done contribute largely to that end. -In some cases the muscular strain either becomes chronic or the pain becomes sufficiently severe to cause the worker to seek relief. Among the hospital cases studied 40, or 4.4 per cent., of the males, 8, or 3.4 per cent., of the females, were designated as suffering from myalgia. In addition 41, or 4.5 per cent., of the males and 8, or 3.4 per cent., of the females had chronic muscular rheumatism. While the latter term should not be used, it is often employed to indicate painful affections presumably muscular in origin. -In addition to the affections noted above, the hospital records showed that among the 916 males 52, or 5.7 per cent., suffered from neuritis or occupational neuroses; among the 236 females 4, or 1.7 per cent., were so designated. While the majority of the cases were diagnosticated as having neuritis, it is more than likely that in most instances they had an occupational neurosis rather than true neuritis. Among the 52 instances encountered among the males, it is interesting to note that just one-half were pressers. If in each case the exact trade process had been indicated rather than the use of the general term \"tailor,\" it is quite probable that the number of pressers would have been even greater. It will be recalled that in the table showing the relation between fatigue and the trade process the pressers were most subject to that condition. Evidently in not a few instances the fatigue of certain muscle groups becomes sufficiently marked to constitute a true occupational neurosis. -In considering the relation of tuberculosis to the trade we considered in detail the various factors which might contribute to the condition. This analysis showed that the morbidity rate of tuberculosis was dependent on two general conditions: (1) The conditions under which the trade is operated, plus the working environment, and (2) the home environment and the general habits of the worker. -These two factors also determine to a great extent, the occurrence of fatigue. Briefly summarized they are as follows: (1) An irregular wage, overtime, \"speeding up,\" unhygienic working environment. (2) Unsanitary neighborhood, overcrowding, unhygienic housekeeping, insufficient and irregular meals, insufficient sleep, intemperance. -In making this brief report it should be understood that at the time this investigation was undertaken it was not the intention to consider in detail the ocular condition of these workers. As the work progressed it was noted by Miss Reed that many of the pressers seemed to be predisposed to \"red eyes, \" and at the suggestion of Dr. Landis I undertook the examination of a number of cases in order to determine the character and extent of this inflammation. After seeing several of these cases it seemed worth while at least to record the other ocular conditions encountered, although no exhaustive examination was attempted. In all, 21 cases were seen, too few for statistical purposes, but still sufficient to satisfy the original intention of the examination, and as the results and personal investigation of several of the shops determined, enough to convince one that many of these individuals were performing their duties under definite ocular difficulties. The 21 cases examined were all noted to have had \"blood-shot eyes\" at one time or another while at work. The examinations were made in the evenings at the Phipps Institute. -The only irritative conditions found were those affecting the lids and the conjunctiva; these were classified as follows: mild catarrhal conjunctivitis in 6 cases; blepharitis in 3; blepharoconjunctivitis in 1; hyperemia of the conjunctiva, including bulbar, in 8. In other words, only 3 cases failed to show some irritation of these structures. As to the ages of those examined, 9 were under forty, and of these, 3 wore glasses; 12 were over forty, and 8 wore glasses, but 6 of these for reading only. In 3 that were over forty and one under forty no facts concerning glasses were obtained. -The visual tests showed that but one man had normal vision with each eye, while but four had approximately normal vision with one eye. Five were doing their work with practically one eye; in two instances due to anisometropia, the one eye being highly myopic; the other three had cataracts, in two instances traumatic in origin. In the remaining cases, with the exception of two where the vision was not tested, the visual acuity varied -from one-half to one-seventh of normal. It should be stated that in two cases there were slight opacities of the cornea in one eye. -Few, if any, of those who wore glasses had availed themselves of the privileges of the many good eye dispensaries at their disposal, but had picked up glasses at some shop in their immediate neighborhood, and as a consequence were doubtless wearing glasses quite unsuited for their eyes. It is a fact long recognized by ophthalmologists, and in late years becoming more appreciated by the laity, that ametropic eyes or eyes improperly refracted are predisposed to just the character of conditions here cited, especially when reinforced by the other conditions surrounding these cases. -The several shops I visited — and I understand they were among the worst — were deplorable from the point of view of ocular hygiene. In certain instances long narrow rooms were lighted solely by windows from the ends; the walls were dark and dirty; and many of the men were working in the most unfavorable positions, and during the colder months adequate ventilation is inconceivable. -In their work the pressers use large irons heated from within by numerous gas-jets. How much of the irritation can be traced to the constantly rising heat and steam, as well as to the possible irritating effects of the products of combustion, it is impossible to say, but these undoubtedly constitute contributing factors, for conjunctival irritation is frequently seen in other trades where dust, heat, steam, and similar irritants are constantly present. -With these brief statements I think it may be assumed that three factors were probably present: (i) Errors of refraction or improperly corrected errors; (2) inadequate and improper lighting f acuities; (3) certain irritants dependent upon the occupation itself. -The first of these can be readily corrected, but unfortunately most of these workers belong to a class difficult to reach, even by the slow methods of education of one sort or another. On the other hand, certain trade and other conditions doubtless influence some of these men against the constant use of glasses. It is a well-known fact that many tradesmen believe that the wearing of glasses jeopardizes their chances for securing employment, and I know of instances where apparently this was the only excuse for the rejection of the applicant. Another possibility is that pressers, from the character of their work, would be subjected to the constant annoyance of \"steamy\" lenses. -The second condition, like the first, is amenable to correction, and should be given due consideration by factory inspectors. However, inspection that can overlook some of the other conditions existing in some of -The third condition, although it might possibly be improved, must be regarded as one of the incidents or risks of the occupation, such as is prevalent in all our trades or professions. Fortunately, the time is near at hand when adequate protection of the tradesman against injury will be appreciated as a valuable asset to all employers and employees as well. -CONCLUSIONS. A serious difficulty encountered in this study was the absence of a comparative material upon which to base conclusions in keeping with generally accepted standards. We are, therefore, forced to admit that whatever evidence was considered conclusive in the light of the data gathered is subject to such verification as an increase in the field of inquiry along the lines followed in this report may render possible, and the application of similar methods to other trades and occupations. -A general statement of the conclusions reached is herein given: i. With few exceptions, the condition of the factories left much to be desired in point of safety and sanitation, and compliance with the provisions of the state laws. -2. While the living conditions did not appear to have a very striking bearing upon the susceptibility of the workers to the effects of the trade processes as expressed in terms of trade illnesses, it is to be borne in mind that we were dealing with a group at work, and that the influence of bad home conditions might manifest itself at any time. -3. The effects of personal hygiene, nutrition, and sleep, however, appear to bear directly upon the extent of illness among both male and female workers, and especially among the females. -4. When we consider the trade processes we find that the pressers among the males were more susceptible to general illnesses that may be attributed to trade process, particularly a highly inflamed condition of the eyelids or conjunctivitis and occupational neuroses. This greater frequency of ill health among pressers increases with advancing age. -6. The illnesses resulting from muscular strain were found to be more common among the males than among the females, but this was due to the character of trade processes in which the two sexes are engaged. -7. \"Colds\" and other general ailments due to conditions of employment and low standards of living were found more frequently among the females than among the males. -8. It is clear, in so far as the evidence gathered in the present inquiry is concerned, that the earnings per worker are higher in the factories in which the sanitary conditions are below standards. Our analysis of the figures relating to trade life, however, shows that the trade life of the worker in the poorer shops is longer, and therefore it is to be presumed that a greater average experience prevails. The finer subdivision of labor in the larger factories would affect the need for wider experience and a consequent higher wage rate. -9. A larger proportion of female workers in those factories classified as bad, receive wages below five dollars per week and ten dollars and over than in the good factories. -10. The wages in the principal trade processes considered in this industry average, in the field covered, practically the same in the three processes — operating, pressing, and basting and finishing. -11. The highest industrial efficiency, as indicated by average wages among the males, is found between thirty-five and forty-four years of age, after which the average wage decreases. -These conclusions represent the principal evidence brought out by this inquiry, and suggest certain practical steps in the methods of collecting statistical data, the methods of factory inspection, and other lines of activity which are here presented. -A recent writer in the American Journal of Public Health has said: \"Industrial disease is a misleading term, used for convenience only, or through ignorance, to indicate certain pathological states, the result of insanitation in industry. Industry itself is never necessarily unwholesome. Industrial processes, it is true, are objectionable and crude, oftentimes, but bad industrial conditions are always remediable.\" -In European countries a great deal of careful investigation has been made concerning the influence of certain industries upon the health of those engaged in them. -We believe that it is legitimate for an employer to insist that every person who works in his factory shall be examined before he is given employment. But how many of these consider this an essential factor in production — not to mention its ethical significance? -On the other hand, we believe that employees have the right to insist that one of their number who has a chronic cough shall be examined for evidence of pulmonary disease if they are to continue work with him. -found in the army and navy. When a man applies for enlistment in either of these services he is first subjected to a careful physical examination, not with part of his clothing on, but with all his clothing removed. Work in the army and navy, so far as the development of disease is concerned, is no more dangerous than work in a steel plant, a brass foundry, or many another industrial plant. -In a discussion on industrial diseases held jointly by the American Association for Labor Legislation and the American Medical Association in Atlantic City in 191 2 the SurgeonGeneral of the navy said: \"We have been looking after occupational diseases in the navy, but entirely on the basis of military efficiency. There is no humanitarian factor in it.\" -Why should not a manufacturer look after the health of his employees entirely on the basis of industrial efficiency? -Chicago\\'s pioneer experiment through several corporations interested in the health of their employees, requiring periodic examinations of all employees, promises to be of unique value. If a certificate of health were required before entering a trade, the subsequent medical history of employees might be studied and the occurrence of diseases among them could be recorded and investigated as to their relation to the work and to the habits of employees when not working. -Some one will want to know what provision would be made, under such a scheme, for the employment of those men who present certain physical defects when they apply for work. Under such a system it might be possible for patients with heart and lung disease to be given suitable employment, and not set to work at tasks too great for them, as is now very frequently the case. Such an inquiry, undertaken in each industry, would be productive of much valuable information concerning the effects of industry on health. -For the best results such an inquiry — industry by industry — should be undertaken by the State Department of Health conjointly with the State Department of Labor as an integral part of its administrative program. -For the proper study of the effect of occupation on health each state should have an adequate body of field workers and trained physicians whose supervising authority in the interest of the entire community should be the central health authority of the state — the State Board of Health. -That such a system is logical and practical has been amply shown by the work of the Massachusetts Board of Health during the last nine years. It remains for us to recognize the fact that the inspection of industrial establishments by well-trained medical men under the supervision of a board -whose duty it is to study the health of the community in the broadest sense — the State Board of Health — means the promotion of public health. -The hygiene of occupation conducted within industrial establishments is an important part, but only a part, of the hygiene of the community. Moreover, with the exception of those occupations which are intrinsically dangerous to health by reason of the nature of materials involved, intelligent conclusions as to. the effect of work conducted in the industrial establishments cannot be reached without some knowledge of the home and community life of the worker. -1. The most urgent requirements for the needs of industrial hygiene in the United States are accurate and complete records of industrial diseases and industrial accidents, and voluntary or compulsory reports thereof should be made to either the State Bureau of Labor or the State Board of Health. -2. The forms or blanks required for compulsory or voluntary notification should be agreed upon by a national committee, and, as far as practicable, such forms should be uniform for all states. -3. The mortality and morbidity experience of life insurance companies by occupation should be made public. -4. The experience data of hospitals, dispensaries, workmen\\'s benefit societies, and the sickness departments of national and local labor organizations would also prove a valuable addition to the present very limited amount of trustworthy information regarding the morbidity in representative industries. -Here, too, the forms and blanks required for this purpose should be agreed upon by a national committee representing the hospital and medical associations of America. -Skip to main content Search UPLOAD SIGN UP | LOG IN BOOKS VIDEO AUDIO SOFTWARE IMAGESABOUT BLOG PROJECTS HELP DONATE  CONTACT JOBS VOLUNTEER PEOPLE Search Metadata Search text contents Search TV news captions Search radio transcripts Search archived websitesAdvanced SearchSign up for freeLog inFull text of \"ERIC ED540859: Three Short Courses in Home Making.

They are in no sense a complete outline of -the subjects with which they deal; rather, they indicate a few of the important phases of food Study; sewing, and care of the homo with which the girl in the elementary school should become familiar; The underlying thought for each problem should be, “Will this help \\'the girls to live more useful lives and will it lead to better conditions in their homes?” -The lessons are purposely made simple, and the plans are definitely outlined, so that tho inexpericncfed teacher will*bo able to get her problem wqjl in hand. The, experienced teaclyu* may find in them suggestions that will be of value in the fnrther development of her course. . \\' -The lessons were originally planned\\' for us? in the rural schools of the South.* During tho six months that they have heen in use, .however, the demand for copies of the outlines hns\\'hccn almost equally great from all parts of the country; hence, in so far as possible, * general problems have been \\'staled. In any case the teacher who desires to use the. course will necessarily have to adapt it ^o her own community, and it* is hoped that she may tie aide to do this with but little alteration. While conditions of living and choice\\'of foods differ in the various parts of the country, general principles of nutrition, rules of sanitation, and methods of cooking and serving ■ are the same for all.\\' • . . -Because of the short school year in some rural schools and the difficulty of securing time on the ^program for frequent lessons in homo making, each of tho courses* has heen limited to 20 lessons. So>no teachers may not be able to have a greater number of lessons during the school year, ahd they will find it well to carry the three, courses through three succcs^ve years. In other schools whero more frequent lessons can be given it may be woll to off er^ all three of the courses during one year. Tho courses in cooking and the care of the home can be combined to advantage, as many of their problems are -1 The original outliios *ere prepared in response to requeete received from southern Stale enperviem -I related.

Longer periods will be necessary for some of the lessons, such as the preparation and serving of a mcai. If no practical work is undertaken in the lesson, a 30-ininulc period % is suflicient. -In. addition to \\'the textbooks listed as sources of special reference lor the rural teacher, the following books bearing on home economics or on methods of teaching are suggested for the rural-school library.

The value of property must lie emphasized. Economy in the purchase and handling of house furnishings and. equipment must bo considetod. Instruction should he given in the care and arrangement of furniture and in the care of foods and clothing. Simple instruction m t ho care of babies should he given, since the children are generally responsible for t he cam of the younger members of their families. -In some of the lessons more subjects may bo suggested than the toachor will have tiyio to take up in a single period. In that case it will bo well for her to choose the subject which seems most vital to the immediate needs of tl»o community. In many cases sho may be ablo to giyp an increased number of lessons, Practico and drill in all of the processes involved in h-Jiisowifery are essential to successful training. • • • -* If a cupboard and table* have boon arranged for the use of rookery classes, most of the suggested work ran be carried out with the school equipment.

Have the girls arrange the furniture in the schoolroom. Discuss and demonstrate the euro of the stove by use of the school stove.. Assign each girl a time when she is to look after the stove on succeeding, days and grade her on her Work. Have each girl bring a report from home ns to what she. uTdoing to -help in the, ciuo of the home kitchen. Make a specific assignment for home work. * \\' . -What are the principal article* of furniture in the kjlchenf What miiflt be kept in a kitchen besides furniture? -It is of the utmost importance that cupl>oards and other places where food is stored he kept free from <lirt ami -scraps of food. Ants, cockroach*®, mice, and other posts infest dirty places where food is kept, and render a house unfit for human habitation. It requires constant care and watchfulness on the part of the housewife to keep cupboards clean. She must look over the shelves daily, wiping them off whenever they need it aiid giving them a\\'thorough cleaning at least once a week. -The housekeeper should know how to care for the various utensils and understand the simplest and heat methods of keeping them clean. Utensils should never bo put in the cupboards until perfectly clean and dry. If utensils have become discolored or badly coated with materials, they should he specially scoured whenthe dishes are washed. If something has been hurned in a kettle, the kettle can bo cleaned\\'by filling with cold water, adding washing soda, and boiling briskly for half an hour; after that a slight scraping ought to take the burned portion off. If not, it should be ladled again with soda water. If a kettle has been used directly over a wood lire and becomes blackened with soot, it should be rubbed off with • newspaper and then with an old cloth. Kettle^ should be dried well before putting away. With proper care they seldom become rusty. If an iron kettle has rusted,, it can bo rubbed. with kerosene and ashes, -then \\'washed in strong, hot, soda water, rinsed in dear hot water, and dried on the stove. If a kettle is very rusty, it should be covered thoroughly with some sort of grease, sprinkled with lime, and left overnight. In the morning it should be washed out with • hot soda water and rinsed in clear, hot watch A new kettle is generally rusty, and shduld/be greased\\' thoroughly inside and out ami let stand two days; then washed in hot soda water. -Soft chimney brick. can be used for scouring, iron Xtensils and steel knives and forks.. If iron pots and frying pans are scrubbed with it piece of soft chimney brick each, time they are used and then washed in hot Soapsuds, they can be kept in good condition. Tinware and steel knives and forks can bo cleaned by scouring .with ashes. Only fine ashes should be used on tinware. The brown stains on granite saucepans should always be scoured off. Coffoo and tea potfe should Jhe cleaned daily, the grounds removed, and the interior of the pots washed out thoroughly. \\'Hie tea kettle should be washed and driod, out over night and left open to air. -If school lunches are served or cooking lessons given at the school, it will be well to use the lesson to got\\' the cupboards in readiness.. ‘If *, 1 \\' it is impossible to do this at school, arrange to have such a lesson in -one of the homos outside of school hours. Be sure that the housekeeper is in sympathy with the work and will coopcraUvwith the plans. \\' -Assign each girl a task in the cleaning, scouring of the dishes, and arrangement of the cupboard. Set a definite amount to he -done and carry, out the plans, leaving a dean and neatly arranged cupboard J at the end of the lesson. / , -There are several points of\\' importance that must bo borne in mind if food is to be kept in good condition. Most foods change easily. Vegetables and fruits lose water, wilt, ami become unfit to eat. Flour and corn meal become moldy. Potatoes decay and sprout. Some foods, such as milk,, turn sour. Eggs become tainted and butter grows rancid. This spoiling can be prevented with proper care in the handling, storing, ami keeping of foods. -If foods are fresh and sound and kept cool and clean in every way, spoiling will not take place readily, because the microorganisms will not develop. If the food is roughly handled and bruised, decomposition will take place readily, for microorganisms develop in the bruised portions. Care must therefore be taken* to select food wisely, han<Ue it carefully, wash it if it is not already clean, put it in clean receptacles, ami keep it in a clean, cool\\' place. \\'All prtts„pans, and dishes in which foods are kept or cooked should be thorouglily cleansed and rinsed well, so that no fragments of food stick to them to . decay and to cause possible infection to the next food that is put in EveTy part of the kitchen and storerooms should be kept clean, dry, and well aired. Light is the best germicide and purifier known. -Covered receptacles should be secured for all foods. Those that . are mouse proof and insect proof are essential .to a well-kept pantry. All bottles and cans should bo neatly labeled and so arranged that each * one can be conveniently reached. The outside of the bottle or case . should always be wiped off after it has been opened and food has been removed from it. The shelves on which food cases are kept should be wiped off every day. If a supply of fruit or vegetables is kept on hand, the food should bo looked over frequently, and any that shows even the slightest suggestion of spoiling should bo removed. Broad shoujd be kept in a covered tin btyc, the box washed out once or twice a week, and frequently aired. -If cooking lessons are to bo given, it will b<\\\\ wcU to have this lesson in connection with the first lesson and to make it a means of arranging for the materials that are to be kept on hand and of determining how everything is to bo handled.\\' -Devote a large portion of the lesson to a discussion\\' of the necessity for care in the handling, storing, and keeping of food. If facilities permit, devote a few minutes to the putting away of foods that are to lie used in the next cooking lesson or school lunch, discussing the reasons for such care. -If one looks after the daily disposal of waste, there will bo no*offending accumulation of trash. Scraps of food that can be no. longer utilized for the table can be fed to the pigs\\' or chickens, but they should not be allowed to stand around alM gather flics. A covered pail or pan should be used for holding the garbage Until final disposal is made of it. Those portions of waste that are badly spoiled and will be of no value in feeding the stock should bo burned up at once. Piles of wpste vegetable substances, if suitable, should be fed to the stock, and if not, should be buried in a thin layer on the ground at some distance from the houso so that they may enrich the soil and not attract flies. ‘ -Utensils that have held food should bo thoroughly washed and rinsed with hot water or steam in order to prevent particles of food from adhering and becoming spoiled. Milk bottles and pans should always be thorougfdy sterilized with boiling water or steam after they have been washed. The garbage can should be boiled with water and soda each day and rinsed with hot water in order to keep it sweet and clean. -OKI papers that are badly soiled should be burned, but all others should be kept for use in cleaning the stove, starting fires, etc. Empty cans should be well washed and buried, so that they will not provo a breeding placo ftir flios. ’ It is well to pierce them through the bottom immediately after opening them’ so that they will not hold water. If not convenient to bury the\\' cans, they should be burned up. Dishwater should he emptied some. distance from the house unless there is a drain near the house. All Receptacles that hold water should be\\' carefully emptied and all depressions in the soil should be filled up to prevent mosquitoes. All waste water can -• Protection of. water supply .-*Only water from deep wells should be used for drinking purposes, because all surface water and water in shallow wells becomes dangerous through seepage from compost, pigpens, privies, and other places where decayed organic matter is accumulated. In order that the water be kept clean, the well must be supplied with a tight-fitting top, which need not be opened, and a metal pump te bring up the water. A well platform that allows water spilled on it to run back into the well is unsafe, for any filth carried on to the platform in any way will bo washed directly into the well. Rats, mice, and other animals get infp the well if the top is not tight, and these, in addition to being unpleasant, are liable to carry germs. \\\\ -Simple disinfectants . — Sunshine and fresh air are nature’s disinfectants, and should be freely admitted to every part of the house. Windows should be left open whenever possible. The windows in sleeping rooms should always beopened at night. The interior of the house should be kept perfectly dry. Decay does not take place in dry places that arc well aired. A damp cellar should be drained off, and the grounds around the house should be prevented from draining into thc^cllar. Coarse coal ashes should be used to -fill in around the house, on the walks, etc., to help secure thorough drainage. The fine ashes should be thinly scattered over the vegetable garden in order to restore the valuable properties they contain to the soil. Wood aShcs can be used as a simple disinfectant to cover decayed organic matter. Whitewash is a good disinfectant and should be frequently used both inside and outside the houso and on att outbuildings. Slacked lime is valuable as a disinfectant for use in the cellar or bam lot. Kerosene and creoline also make good disinfectants for frequent spraying of the barn lot. -Care of out-of-door dasets . — The privy should be so arranged that, it may be cleaned often and all excreta disposed of in a safe way. The building should be so well built that there will be no cracks for the constant adnrii&sion of flies. In a poorly constructed building, old paper can bo posted in the cracks to make the structure fly proof. After each using dry earth, street dust, or lime should bo sprinkled through the seat, then the scat should bo closed to prevent flics or mosquitoes entering. The top of the seat should be frequently washed, and both the seat and the floor in front of it scrubbed at least once a week. -It will be well to teach this lesson at a time when improvements are necessary in the care of the schoolhouse. The discussions in regard to out-of-door closets will have to be taken up at a time when the girls are alone wjth the teacher. -Discuss the disposal of tvaste, the care of garbage etc for the home and for. the school. Talk over the cafe of^Lte from Z school lunch and discutfe methods of keeping the school in sanitary condition. Follow this by general cleaning about the schoolhousl -Molt the fat slowly.

While it is heating and cooling, discuss the process of soap making, cost of materials, care necessary j n the making of soap and importance of its use. Get the other materials ready for the recipe and a box for molding the soap, and have the girls work together. After the soap has hardened and been cut, have the girls put it away on a shelf to dry. \\' 1 JV -Points to he remembered when a meal is to be served: The dining room must bo clean, free from dust and flies, well {tired, sufficiently lighted, and in gootj order. . • # -Die table must be perfectly clean and covered’ with a clean white cover (tablecloth, doilies, paper napkins, or oilcloth). A vase of flowers or leaves, or a small potted plant, arranged in tho center of the table, will help to make the table attractive. -The table should bo prepared with everything necessary for serving the meal, but only those foods plafccd on it that wjll not be spoiled with standing. If there is danger of the food attracting flies, cover it carefully. -Plates for everyone who is to partake of the meal should be arranged at oqual distances from one (mother, half an inch from the edge of the table. „ -The knife should bo placed at the right of Ihe plate with the cutting edge toward the plate and half an inch from the edge of the table. -The fork should be placed at the left of the plate with the tines of the fork turned up and half an incli from the edge of the table. -The spoon should be placed, bowl upward, at tho right of the plate, to the right of the knifo if it is to be used first, to the left of tho knife if it is not used until after the knife is used. It should bo placed half an inch from the odge of tho table.\\' Spoons and forks for serving should be placed at tho right of tho ono who is to serve. No ono at the table should have to use tho personal fork or spoon for serving either herself or othors. , -Cups and saucers should bo placed® tho right of the plate with the handle of the cup turned to the right. -Saifs and peppers should be placed in tho center of. tho table or at tho sides where they can bo conveniently readied. Individual salt dishes, if used, should be placed immediately in front of the individual plate. -N The chairs should be placed up to tho table after it is sot. Caro should be taken not to place them so close that it will bo necessary to move them when they are occupied* -• If possible, arrange to give this lesson before Lesson VIII in the •’ sories of “Twenty Lessons in Cooking” is given; then the-empliasis in that lesson can bo put upon what to servo, proper .combinations, etc., while this lesson gives the drill in tho arrangement and handling of dishes. •. « \\' -It is desirable to give tho girls thorough drill in table setting and table service, since much of tho pleasuro derived from eating foods depends upon careful attention to these processes. -Be careful to see that everything necessary is on hand to set the table nicely but simply. For class practice a small table can be set * for four. This will necessitate a table cover; five or mpre dinner -disl., a platter, one serving spoon, and one serving fork. If these h.ngs are not already in the school, they can probably be brought -lhive a diagram of the arrangement of an individual place at the table made on tho blackboard by somo of the girls. -The processes of table setting should be demonstrated With the dllions^ 8 haUd a “ d th ° W ° rk 8l *° Uld b<3 adapted t0 homo co »If there is no available table in the schoolroom, the desk tons can -of nkdim kn^ I th H° f0rm9 Used 8hould be givon-the convenience placing knives and spoons to the right, forks to the left and the -nJi? er80n Wh ° is t0 wait ‘ on table must be careful to see that ~ 18 in readiness before the meal is announced, so that she • °“ d° her work readily without subjecting those at the table W -• delay. She stiould have drinking water, broad, and butter (if used) at band, hot dishes ready for the hot foods, and clean dishes laid out ; for the dessert. She innst seo that her own hands are perfectly clean .and her hair and dress iii order. A clean, \\'neat apron will always improve her appearance. The room \\'should be clean and neatly arranged before the meal is served. -If the meal is to bo a family one and all are to sit-down at the table together, plated will be passed from one to another as they arc served, -. but it will still be well to have one person appointed to wait on the table. She can keep watch and bo ready to supply more bread, water, etc.,when it is necessary and to change the plates for the dessert course. She should riso from the table quickly and quietly j! m order not to disturb the others and should /ako her place again as soon as all necessary service has been rendered. -The following riiios should be observed: Always handle tumblers •from tho base, being careful not to bring tho hands in contact with i the upper edge. Kill only three-fourths full. . j -Cut bread in even slfces, pile neatly on serving plate, and place bn table, covering with a clean napkin or towel if flies aro bad or* there I is danger of dust. Place\\' dessert dishes at one end of tho table, or better still on a side tablo until time to use them, men carrying dishes to and from the table be careful not to put the fingers in contact with tho food. Learn to place the band under tho dish. In nico service a napkin is used\\' between tho hand and the dish or a tray is used if the dish is a small one. The tray, should he covered with a mipkin or\\\\loily. -When a dish is paasod, hold it at tho left of tho person to bo served’ low enough so that she can help herself readily. Be\\'suro that each dish of food is supplied with a spoon or fork for serving, and turn the handle of the serving spoon or fork toward the one being serve*!. -If a plate is to ho placed in front of a person, set it down from the right and remove it from tlie right. •. Never reach in front of others at the table. -When a course is finished remove all large dishes first; then the soiled plates, knives, and forks. Be careful to handle only a few dishes at a time and not to pile them. If another course is to be served, crumb the table, using a napkin and plate for the purpose and brushing the orumbs lightly into the plate. Fill the glasses and arrange tho dishes and forks or spoons quickly for tho next course. -men the meal is over tho chairs should bo moved back from Jthe table, the dishes neatly piled and carried to the -kitchen sink, the table wiped off, tho crumbs brushed up from the floor, and the\\' room aired. -Ivot this lesson bo a continuation of the previous one, puttim; emphasis on the motho.i of waiting on table. The some articles for setting the table will bo required that were in use in the last lesson. In addition to these the girls must bo careful to have clean nprons for the lesson on table service. -Have the tablo set as a review of the work of the last lesson; then have four or six of the girls seated at the table and go through the forms of serving one another to any simple meal upon which the class may decide. Family mc.al service should be explained and demonstrated first; .then service where there is one waitress. Have one girl art as waitress and serve all the others. Let them fake, turns in offering and plating food, removing soiled dishes, filling tumblcts, eto. -Rooms which are in constant use should bo brushed up and dusted every day.

This is essential to every room in the house if perfect health is to ho maintained. -It will be well to have Lesson IX given in one of the homes some day after school hour?L if possible. If that can not be arranged, the schoolroom can be uulized as the place for practice. -Devote Ivcsson VIII to a discussion of the methods of cleaning anti to various short tasks about the schoolroom. . Li Lesson IX have t he \\'•girls go through the entire process of cleaning a room. Assign some portion of the tosk to each one of the girls so that all of them can take part in the work. Supervise the work carefully, assign homo practice in the cleaning of rooms, and have each girl clean a room at home once a week for a month -As sooii as tfne is dressed in the ‘morning, tho windows in the bedroom should be opened to air the room jmd tho bedclothes should be separated and put on chairs. bcfoVo the window to air. Tho slo|>s should he emptied and tho chamber washed with cold water, using a special cloth. The howl should be washed in warm, soapy water, which should then ho poured into the chamber ami used for washing it. The toilet articles should ho washed, then tho howl rinsed and wiped dry. The slop jar should be washed out thoroughly, and* frequently tho slop jar and the chamber should ho washed out with chloride of lime or some other disinfectant. The pitcher should he ^filled with fresh water and all articles arranged neatly on the washstand. If towels arc. soiled, clean ones should be supplied. The .bed should be made carefully, the mattress turned, the first .sheet tucked under the mattress all around, and tho other covers tucked m at the bottom and two sides of the bed. The bed should bo kept free from wrinkles and smooth in appearance. The pillows should -be well shaken ami arranged at the head of the bed. The floor should be brushed up, the furniture dusted, and everything put in pli.ee. The windows should be left partly opened so that the bednm.n is well aired. A sufficient amount of fresh air is absolutely\\' essential in a bedroom,, and it is important, that tho room bo well aired out during the day and left with windows open at night. .1 .When the room is to be thoroughly cleaned, the framo of the bed should bo dusted and the bed made up. The window shade* should lie dusted and rolled up. Curtains should bo well shaken and covered if one has a dust sheet. All small articles on the bureau, table and shelf should be placed on the bed and the whole covered with a sheet..

The room should be ^wept. and duster! -As soon as dust, has settled, covers should be removed from the furniture, and the furniture, nigs, and all small articles shopld bo restored to their places. Shades should be adjusted and tho room left in perfect order. The broom and everything else that has been used in the wofk should be cleaned ami put back into place. -It may be possible for the teacher to give this lesson in her own bedroom or in the bedroom of some of the neighbors. Unless this is feasible the only way to have it effective is to have the girls report, each flay on tho work they do at homo. -Illustrate each process and give reasons for everything that is .\\' doin\\', hinphasizo the importance of the sanitary care of the bedroom, a regular time for doing the work, and the benefit of having each member of the family care for her own personal belongings and her own portion of the hodroom. -Directions for cleaning and filling the lamp.— A bright light comes from clean burners that allow a good draft. This means constant care on the part of the one that looks after the lamps. In tho daily J cleaning of. lamps, first dust tho chimney shade and the body of tho lamp. Wash tho chimney. If sooty, clean with newspaper bkoro washing. Next, turn the^wick high enough to show all the charred part; cut this off, making it perfectly e ven, then rub with a piece of -,hl “ l r hcr b arquRlnlwl w,th ,ho IMMtbllUta.

Fill the body of the lamp with oil within an inch of the top, leaving plenty of mom for tho pas that may he generated from the kerosene. The gas that is generated in a lamp that has been used many times without retilling may be a source of danger. £ -When lighting the lamp first turn (lie wick down, allowing the chimney to become heated gradually. If necessary to move the lighted lamp,. fiM-tuni. thq wick low. The flaring up ofdiicjla^e smokc-s the* chimney. IV. tioY leave a lighted lumpin a room where there is no one to watch it.

Do not till the lamps near the kitchen sUive. Do not li.rht a inat4*h while the oil ran is out. Never till a lamp while lighted or while near another one wlueli is lighted. If a lire is caused by kerosene, smother it with a heavy rug ox woolen garment. Do not attempt t4> put it out with water. \\\\ -It will he well to give this lesson just before some evening entertainment at the srhoolhouse. if there are no lamps at the srhoal have a few brought in from neighboring homes. Secure an old p i and cloths to use in cleaning. -Talk with t}ie girls about tho cost ami properties of kerosene and the danger of having a light near a can of kerosene. Explain the draft bjr means of which the kerosene can bo made to burn on the wick, and tho danger if the burner becomes clogged up and the draft cut off. Have the lamps taken apart, burners boiled, chimneys cleaned, and body of the lamps filled and wiped off. Then havoUhe lamps lighted to see that they burn properly. -Household pests an* annoying, dangerous to health, and distinctive to property. Hosts carry disease germs from one person to another ami fmmSothcr animals to huniitn beings. Absolute) cleanliness in every part, of the house is essential if the. place is he kept fret\\' from pests. As a rule, pests\\' flourish in dark, damp, dirty places. Hie housekeeper cun keep her place free from pests with tho proper, cure. Jf pests get started, the housekeeper should know how to exterminate them. . ^ -dipped, in kerosene, run briskly over all surfaces. Care must bo taken to have no lire in the house, while t his is being done. Windows should he* open and the room kept free \\'from dust. In four days this should he repealed, to kill any hugs that mav have just hatched. -(\\'ockrtwclits ami watirbugs. — A solution of 1 pound of alum to :> pints of water should he poured into all eraeks. Insect powder and borax are also elfeetive. Absolute elennli ness and freedom from dampness* are necessary if the house is to be kept free from roaches. -Oil of cloves or pennyroyal on pieces of cotton batting scattered about in the places where ants appear will drive them away. Saturating the nests with coal oil will destroy them. Food which attracts ants should he removed from places which they are apt to reach. „ -H<it$ aiul win are best exterminated by the use. of a trap or one* preparation like ‘’Hough on Hats.” Traps should be set nightly and slnniid bo scalded ami aired aft^r a mouse has been caught . Hat ttolcs may he stopped up by sprinkling with chloride of lime and then tilling. with mortar or plaster of Haris. -Mosquito* ft breed in sw mpy places or in old barrels or kegs or tin cans which hold stagnant water. Therefore, if the swampy places bo drained and the grounds about tho house kept free from stagnant water tho housekeeper will generally not bo troubled with mosquitoes. Empty barrels or kegs should he inverted and old tin cans should ’have a hole punched in the bottom so that, they will not catch water. All high weeds near the house should he cut down and destroyed so that they will not provide a dampplace to harbor mosquitoes. If it As impossible to get rid of all standing water, tho breeding of mosquitoes can bo checked by pouring ke/osono oil on the water. One ounco of oil on 15 square feet of water is sufficient. This will have to bo renewed at least onco in 10 days. Tho doom, windows, and ventilators of tho house shouhl be well screened as a protection against mosquitoes. -Flies are ono of tfio greatest carriers of typhoid and other germs and filth of all sorts. They can be gotten rid of only \\'when the breeding places are dostroyod and the flies killed as rapidly as possible. Materials that attract flies should not be oxposod in and about the house. The houso should be woll screened with wire mesh or mosquito netting to koep out the flies. A fly swatter should be kept at hand. Stables should be cleaned daily and the barn lot frequently sprayed with korosone, creoline, or limo. -These, house pets should be given frequent baths, the rugs on which they he should be brushed and shaken daily, and the floorswashed with soap and water and wipod with kerosene. -Moths are apt to devolop in woolen garments unless the garments are thoroughly shaken and absolutely protected by wrapping in newspaper and put away. Woolen garment^ that aro used only occasionally should be kept in a light, dry place, handled frequently, and hung in the sun occasionally. Moths or carpet beetles can be exterminated from carpets by applying keroseno ** -Give this losson at a time whon the girls aro asking about thd* household pests or when tlio school is suffering from some pests. It would bo well to have the lesson in tho spring just before .school closes, so. that the girls can put -into practice what they learn. It may bo desirable to dovote the efforts to tho destruction of one particular pest. For example, a fly crusade may bo inaugurated. -If there are posts in the schoolroom, discuss their habits, what seems to attract them, where they como from, etc. Havo girls report any pests they have at homo. Explain why they aro dangorous, toll how they can be oxtorminatod, and assign to each girl the extermination of one household post. Have her report oach day the success of hor offorts. Continue this work for sovoral weoks. -As garments and household linens are apt to become stained and thus lose their attractiveness, it is well to\" know remedies for tho mopt common stains and the principle upon which their removal depends. All -stains, should be removed as soon after they occur , as possible. Boiling water will loosen and remove coffee, tea, and fresh fruit stains. The stain should be held over a bowl and the -water poured upon it with some force. Cold water wiU remove stains from blood or meat Juice. Soaking will help in tho removal of blood • stains. Rust stains can be removed by wetting the stain wRfr lemon juice, covering with salt, and placing in tho sun. Stains from stove blacking, paint, and grass can be removed by soaking in kerosene arid washing well with soap and water. Ink stains can bo removed by soaking in water, removing as much as possible, then soaking in niiJk. Stains from cream and other, forms of grease can be washed out in cold water, followed with warm water and soap. -White cotton and white liften materials can be bleached by exposing while damp to the sunshine. If left out overnight the bleaching process is made effective by the moisture furnished by the dew arid frost. A stream of strain from the teakettle may also help the bleaching process. -Some colors are set by the addition of a small amount of acid to the first water in which they are soaked, while others are se$ by the use of salt. It is necessary to try a small amount of the material before dipping in tho entiro garment in order to be sure of results. Vinegar should be used for blues; use one-half cup to one gallon of water. Salt is most effective for browns, blacks, and pinks. In most cases two cups of salt to one gallon of cold water will be enough. -The towels used for drying dishes or the linen used for some school entertainment may have become stained with coffee, fruit, or some other substance. Make this the basis of a lesson and have the girls bring other things from which they Wish to remove stains. Each girl should havo an article from which to remove a stain. Let this lesson be preliminary to tho lesson On laundry work. % -Examine the various articles at hand from which stains are to be removed Discuss tho method of removal and hay© each girl Work on her own stain until it is as nearly removed as possible. -Dish towels should be thoroughly washed out at least once a day. Wash one piece at a time (cleanest first) £4 warm soapy water and rinse in clear Water in another pan. Hang up in the sun, if possibly so that the air will pass through*. Boil at least once a week in soapy water to keep fresh and white. Sunshine and fresh air are yaluabte* for the purpose of bleaching and purifying. -Wwh the school curtains in hot, soapy water; boil, rinso, and .blue slightly. A small amount of thin starch may be dosirable for the curtains. A thin starch can bo inado as follows: -Add the .-old water to the starch ind lard, stir until smooth, then add the boiline water sloyly , sturiuR constantly. Itoil for several minutes in order to cook the starch -Hang the curtains in the sun to dry, shaking well before putting on the line and In ding the edge over at least fi inches. Be sure to have a clean line. When dry fold carefully. A short time before *imninp, sprinkle well. -It mj*y be desirable to give this lesson earlier in tho course, if cooking lessons arc being given and dish towels are in uso, or if tile school curtains artf badly soiled. Other articles may be washed if Jimo and facilities permit. -Discuss briefly the need for laundry work and the general principles. I lave’ the girlh each take a turn washing the towels or curtains; examine tho articlo after it is washed and give careful direetidns for the boiling, bluing, and starching. While these process^ are being completed, have some of the girls prepare tho line. Have two girls appointed to bring the towels in off the line before they go • borne from school. . -To do good ironing it is necessary to havo a firm, unwarped ironing board. This should bo covered with some thick woolen matorial and a white muslin cover that is clean, smooth, and tightly drawn. The thick cover should bo tacked on, while, the \\'top cover should bo pinned so that it can be easily taken off for cleaning. A heavy holder should be provided for handling the’ irons. Irons should bo clean and smooth. Paper should bo kept at hand to keep tho irons clean and a piece of beeswax, sandpaper, or salt should bo provided for keeping them smooth. A small cloth should bo used to wipe off the iron after using the beeswax. A newspaper should be spread on the floor to protect any pieces that may haing down that far while being ironed. The* coareor towels should be ironed firet.Ks the irons grow smoother the longer they are used. Starched pieces should not be -ironed until the irons have become very hot. Every piece should be ironed until perfectly dry. If the article is first\\' laid smooth it will be easier, to iron it and keep it in shape. As soon as ironing fe complcfccd the articles should bo hung yip to air out well -Arrange to have the ironing lesson just as soon after the laundrv lesson as possible. It will probably be easy to borrow the necessary equipment from near-by homes. Each girl can be appointed to bring something that will contribute toward the equipment and oiks girl can be appointed to have the fire ready and another to put the irons on to heat before tho lesson hour. , -Call the girls together early in \"tho morning or at some other time previous to the lesson period and give them directions for sprinkling the articles to be ironed. When the class hour comes, demonstrate the method of ironing, folding, and hanging the articles and have the girls take turns doing the work. -Because young^irls are fond of little children and must often help their mothers with their baby brothers and sisters, they should know , w to c,ire for them. It is essential that they understand the following points: The little body needs protection. The head is soft and tho brain may bo injurod by hard bumps or pressing. The skin is tender and is easily irritated by the bites of insects, friction, etc. hacking, wiggling, etc., are necessary to the development of the baby’s muscles, but the baby should not be played with.all the timo for it is well for it to lie quietly a portion of tho timo while an\\'uke. It should not be made to sit up until ready to do so. A desire to creep should i>e encouraged. Standing or walking should not be taught the baby until it tries to do so for itself and then it must be helped verv carefully. ■ * J -The baby should have plenty of fresh air and should bo allowed to -spend much of its time out of doom. In cold weather the baby must l>o>wamily covered and sheltered from high winds. Its eyes should, always bo protected from strong sunlight. ^ ^ i -Regular hours should bo observed for sleep and the baby should bp put to bed early at night. If the house is not well screened, a mosquito bar should be put over the baby’s crib. Clothing should be light and looso, so that the body can move freely. -• Perfect cleanliness is necessary to keep tho.baBy’s skin in good condition. A daily bath should be given. A morning hour is usually the best time for bathiiig the baby, midway between the meals. -i ])ab y should be taught to use the chamber before the bath ami after the nap. Everything should be ready before the baby is undressed. The room should bo very, warm. The water should bo only moderately warn and should bo carefully tested, to make sure that it is not too hot. The towels and covers for the baby should be at hand The head and feet\\' should be washed first, and the body soaped before putting the child into the bath. Little soap should be used for washing the baby, for even the best soap is strong and apt to irritate the dol.cate skin. Tho bath should be \\'given quickly the body wiped very dry and covered is soon as washing is completed. -I he baby should be fed in small quantities at regular intervals and given plenty of cold water to drink. Not until 11 or 12 months of age should it bo given solid or semisolid food . Evon then milk should continue to form the basis of the child\\'s diet, and of this a considerable quantity should be used— about a quart a day from the twelfth month on. As tho child grows older a more varied diet will be neces-ments, pickles, preserves, canned meats, fish, pork, sausage, cheap candies, coarse vegetables, unripe and overripe fruits, stimulants, foods treated with a preservative or coloring matter, and half-cooked starches. , . -The teacher should talk with the girls in order to see what points in connection with tho care of the baby it.is necessary for them to know in order to do their work at home intelligently. . -It will probably not be possible to have anything more than a class ’ discussion of tho points in question, but the girls’ home experiences ought to make this discussion vital. If there is a nurse is the neighborhood who can be securod to give one lesson on the care of the baby, the teacher should supplement her own lessons with an additional lesson by the nurse. • -In connection with tho care of the baby tlib teacher will be able to secure help from bulletins entitled: -Infant Care Care of Children, Series No. 2, Bureau Publication No. 8, Children’e Bureau, Unitfid States Department of I.ahor, Washington, D. C. \\' -Pood for Young Children, Farmers’ Bulletin 717, Division of Publications, Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. . t ^ -It is of great importance that all children learn the value of prop* erty in an elementary wav. This will prepare them for the knowledge of the cost of living that is essential. They can learn that the cost of food can be decreased by keeping gardens and by proper choice, care, and handling of foods; that care of clothing will reduce this item of expense; and that the owning of ono’s own house and lot is something worth forking for in order to reduce the cost of rent. -The toucher wHl have to acquaint herself thoroughly with condi’tions in tho community so that she can talk intelligently with the girls, emphasize the right points, and give them constructive help. -Begin with a discussion of the cost of food ; how much tho children earn or spend during tho Week ; and why it is worth while to cook and sew well, and look after property. Continue such discussions from time to time in connection with other school work. * -It is well for one to* keop a written rocord of all money received and all money spent. Children should bo taught to do this as soon as they aro big enough to have money in their possession. ,A simple htllo notebook in which all expenditures are entered on tho rmht side and all rocoipts on tholeft side, with the balance drawn up each wcok or month will provejan easy and satisfactory method of keeping accounts. • If tho little gi\\\\l learns to do this with her pennies, she will be bettor ablo to take care of the moro important, household accounts when she is in charge ol a home. However, then) will be no good incentive for her to keep accounts unless she is endeavoring to savo for some good purpose. If she learns to save for the ifuturo purchaso of a book, a dross, or soino littlo treat, she will fool that her account kooping is worth whilo. As a housekeeper she will, appreciate tho importance of saving for somo future good to the family— a better house) school for the children, etc! -. introduce it at a time when the girls in the class are saving for some Sjxjcific purpose— material for a dress to bo made in sewing class, refreshments for a party for their mothers, a school library, or som* thing else that will be a pleasure and htalp iu school work. -Aftor discussing the possible sources of income of the girl and of her family , and\\'tlio means of increasing and taking care of that\\' income discuss simple methods of keeping accounts, illustrate th\\'cm on tlio blackboard, show how t<, balance tho accounts,.\\' and see that each girl has a small book for tho purpose. It may bet neccssary\\'to make or to rulo this book as a nortion o/ the class exerciso. -Closely allied to the housekeepers work within tho home is. tho care of the oxtenor of tho houso and its surroundings. It is absolutely ; n«cessftry that tho grounds ho kept neat ami clean. In addition to , this they should be made. attractive by tho careful selection of a few j shrubs rightly placed. While tho gardens at the rear of tho house • may bo planned solely for tlio pleasure and. uso of the family in ’ -I Pining the lawn at tho sides and front of tho house the neighbors and passers-by must ho considered. Tho grounds should Jio a picture of which the homo is tho center, the shrubs being grouped to frame > the picture. In order to do this, tho center of tho yard should he left open with an occasional tree or shrub, so placed and pruned that it will not hido the house. Shrubs and vines should ho plant od close to the houso to broak tho sovoro lino between the houso and. lawn and so utilized as to hido tho sheds. _ Tho arrangement and varieties of shrubs and vinos should linrmonizo both at iho front and sides of the house. One, two, or three kinds should bo chosen as a basis. -If a shrub is planted at ono corner of tho house, the samo variety should be planted at tho other end.

For this purpose a deep, fich soil is necessary and ever} square foot of space should be utilized. Every family should loam to mako use of an increased number of vegetables and fruits and to c ook them in a variety .of ways. No crops should bo allowed to go to vusto. Intensive .12-months gardening should be practiced. A family of five people could be entirely provided with vegetables from a garden less than 75 by 50 feet. -• With the exception of sweet peas, allflowers needed for picking purposes should bo grown in the flower borders ikthe back yard Sweet peas should bo planted in rows in the vegetable section. The attractiveness, as well as the usefulness, of tho flower borders do-• pends upon tho choico and arrangelnent of flowers. The flowers sliould.be chosen as to height of plants, color of blooms, and seasons of blooming. Tho tallest plants should be placeu at tho back of.the border; for a border G fcot wide none of tho plants need be over 5 feet\\'. -• There can bo a riot of colors if the flowers are arranged in-clumps of four to six throughout th6 entire length of the border. In a wollplaunod flower border some flowers should be in bloom each month. Hardy perennial flowers should predominate, with enough annual -<flowors to fill up tho spaces and hide tho soil. ‘A surprisingly large I , number of plants will bo needed. Perennial flowers should be startod in seed beds in March and tho plants transplanted into tho flower borders in October. Annual flowers should be started in flats in early spring and tho plants transplanted into the flower borders in April. * Tice well-tried, old-faAhioned flowers will give the best satisfaction.

The instruction given in the lessons should bo based on this knowledge. Possibilities for the improvement of accepted methods should be considered. Those foods should be used in the recipes which the children can afford to uso at home. Thoy should be encouraged to raise other foods in thoir gardens and to keep chickens, pigs, and cows. -Elementary principles of nutrition and sanitation should he taught. Simple meals should be planned with plain but well-cooked dishes. Variations should bo suggested and the value of a mixed diet emphasized, (\\'are should be taken not to waste time on points that are unrelated to tho homes of the girls, except as such points may be necessary to raise their ideals. -All the work should he carefully done. * Sanitary handling of food and care in storage of foods should be insisted upon. Careful attention should ho given to the dish washing, care of dish towels, etc., emphasizing -those points in sanitation, involved. The girls should be drilled faithfully in all points essential to the handling of anything that comes in contact with tin* food. -Proper methods of sweeping and cleaning should he employ\\'d and thoroughness practiced in every detail of the work. Thorough drill in these processes should he given. j -\\'flic order in which tlvc lessons are to he given will he regulated in part by the season of the year in which they occur, the locality, the foods obtainable, and any special local needs. However, care must be taken that the lessons occur in proper sequence*, so that the pupils will see the relation of one to the other and will appreciate the value of each. It may he necessary to combine two lessons or to give only part of a lesson. In some of the lessons more recipes are suggested than could he prepared in a brief period. In every case the choice of recipe wdl have to be made by Hie individual* teacher. Wherever possible, simple experiments to show the composition and ’ effect of heat on food should lie used. ‘ j -No attempt has been made to give a complete set of recipes. Those included are chosen to illustrate the subjects to he discussed j in the lessons. A few havo been, taken from the Farmers’ Bulletins and from circulars of. the Extension Service of the Department of | Agriculture. Tho others lnivo been carefully tested and used with satisfactory results. Tho teacher who desires to* make use of a greater number of recipes will do well to supply herself with one of j the textbooks listed. Level measurements should he used iu the preparation of all tho recipes and all the directions should he carefully followed. . -The first few lessons are more fully outlined than the others, furnishing suggestions lor methods*. of procedure that can also be adapted to tho later lessons. Tho teacher should have a detailed plan for every lesson, outlining her method of work, the leading questions for the discussion, and the borne assignment which she desires to make. -tfoods that are in common use are suggested for the lessons outlined. There will necessarily he exceptions to their use in different -Jocalitios. If foods used in the homes are harmful because of tile manner in which they imv prepared, the teacher should do aJl in her power to correct the custom, hut she mustvbo careful not to ho too radical. If the lessons given are not repeated by home inaeti.v, time will bo practically wasted. Simple meal service should bo introduced wherover possible, and ns much instruction on the furnishing and care of the kitchen should ho included ns time permits. -K.v the time the course is completed, the girl should be able to keep her kitchen in sanitary condition, and she should have a knowledge of food values and of the processes of cooking sufficient to provide simple, wholesome meals for her family. -For the teaching of food values, it will he helpful to secure the set of.l o food charts, that can be obtained for $1 from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D. -C. -1 ho State Department of Kducation or the State university, cob lege, or normal schools, through their extension departments, may issm« material that will bo of help to the rural teacher in planning her lessons. -The teachers will find. it helpful to secure and study the Farmers’ >£> Bulletins listed below.

Tho body uses foo,d t<> build and repair its tissues,, to provide heat and energy, and to rcgulato body processes. Foods differ from one another in their composition and in their ability to perform the work of tho body. . Thcso differences have led to the classification of foods into five groups, which aro spoken of as the five food stuffs or food principles. -Cooking .— While somo foods can bo used as they occur in nature, most foods are made more acceptable by tho application qf heat* Hoat softens the structure of vegetables and fruits, makes tender tho tissues of moat, prepares starch for digestion, develops flavor in.. \\' many foods, and destroys parasites and germs that may be present in food. The five food stuffs are differently affected by teat, somo require slow cooking, others require intense heat. Hence, it is neoessary to study cooking that each food may he properly prepared. -The stove.— A knowledge of tho construction of the stove and the methods whereby heat is obtained is necessary if one is to be a successful cook. For all stoves three things are necessary— fuel, a supply of oxygen, and a certain degree of heat, known as the kindling point, whereby the fire is started. The supply of oxygon is regulated by dampers and checks so arranged as to admit or cut off the draft of air . 1 -The creative dampers are doors or slides that come below the fire box. When open they admit the entrance of air, increase the draft and facilitate combustion. -The oven damper is a flat plate which closes the opening into the chimney .flue to decrease the drawing t>f the draft. When the oven damper is closed, the hoat from the fire remains in the stove and passes around the oven. ’ -, Chocks are slides or doors higher than the fire box, which, when open, allow the cold air to pass over, the fire, retarding combustion. -A stovo is also provided with means for disposing of the ashes soot, and the gases formed. AU parta of the sLo £e so a Zg3 that they can be kept clean. ■ -Thore should W provided for this lesson some fruit or vegetable season (from the homes of the pupils, if possible) that can be cooked by dry heat. Each child may be ahle to bring an apple or a teacher should be sure to hpve an oven that can be :°„ h ? tcd for bakm 8; .and to have the fire well started before the lesson begins so that the oven will be ready for use. If there is no -nln of a nnn? ° f ™ heS *\" d hot . can be arranged to surround the pan of applos m such a way that they will bake. -A lesson in geogtaphy and nature fetudy should bo correlated with tho cooking lesson to giye the pupils opportunity to study the source of foods and the reasons for cooking foods. -One of the pupils should write the recipes for the lesson on the blackboard before the lesson hour. -Wash the apples, core thorn, and cut through the skin with a knife so that the .™i« can expand in baking without breaking the skin.

Encourage them to bring a dish from home to take the results of their work home for the family meal if a school lunch is not served, or if they do not need a lunch. Give careful directions for washing dishes and supervise the housework carefully. ’ . . -(It may he necessary to go on with some other recitation before the baking is completed, in which case one member of the class should bo appointed to watch the oven.) -(Time the baking carefully and discuss more thoroughly at the close of the lesson ) How can we tell when it is done? -Home assignment — Pupils should prepare the baked dish at homo and report their work at the next lesson. -Water. All fluids and tissues of tho body contain largo quantities v of water, therefore water is regarded as ono of the most important foodstuffs required by the body.. Practically all foods contain somo water. The fresh vegetables and fruits provide tho body with a high per cent of water. -Water is a valuable medium for cooking. As it heats, small bubbles are formed which continually increase in number and size, but gradually disappear. Some time before tho boiling point is reached an occasional largo bubblo will rise to the surface and disappear. The water has then reached the simmering point, 185°, a temperature frequently inade use of in cooking. When many bubbles form and break, causing a commotion on the surface of the W;ater, the boiling point, 212®, has been reached. -Mineral matter ,— Mineral matter is\\' a second foodstuff that is needed by the body, but the amount required is vory small. Jjf aj -the diet. Fruits and vegetables, especially fresh green vegetables are comparatively rich in mineral matter. Mineral matter builds up \\' the bones and certain tissues like hair, teeth, and nails, and regulates the body processes by keeping the blood and digostivo fluids in proper condition. 4 r -Green vegetables .— The green vegetables hold an important place in the diet bccauso they contain valuable mineral salts. They also contain a high percentage, of water and considerable cellulose. With \\'s few exceptions they should be eaten raw, because, the mineral salts being soluble, are lost in the water in which they are cooked, and because the cellulose serves its purpose best in the orisp form, Cabbago is rendbred muoh more difficult of digestion by cooking. Spinach, beet tops, eto., are more palatable cooked. The delicately flavored vegetables should be-boiled in a very small amount of Water so that they need not bo drained. Thus the mineral matter will be rctame^when the vegetables are served. -There should be provided for the losson some fresh vegetables in season (from the home of the pupils, if possible), one that can be cooked by boiling, and one that oan be served uncooked With a simple dressing. r -Wash vegetables thoroughly, leaving in cold water to crisp, if wilted. Keep cool until ready to serve, then arrange neatly and drees with salt, vinegar, knd oil as desired, or prepare a French dressing as follows: -vll’ M b ‘\",.

If spinach is stirred constantly, no water. . Stor ^y vegetables should be completely covered with water, and -.trong-flavorod vegetables (tp turnips, onions, cabbage, and cauliflower) \\'should be cooked in a large amount of boiling water. -After vegetables have cooked for a few minutes salt should be added, one teaspooniui to each quart of water. -Cook the vegetable until it can be cialy pierced with a fork. Let the water boil away at the last. If neceeeary to ifirain, do so as soon\\' as tho vegetable is tender. Season with salt, pepper, and butted (ft teaspoon salt, } teaspoon pepper, and \\\\ tabled spoon butter to each cup of vegetable). -Discuss 4ho boiling of water nn<i its value in cooking. Have tho girls observe and describe the boiling of water. -If a new tin saucepan or other bright tin vessel is at hand to heat the water in, tho cjionges which take place as tho temperature increases will bo more readily apparent and tho girls will enjoy watching the process. , , -Emphasize tho cleaning of the vegetable, its structure, composition, and the effect of -Abe boiling water upon it. -‘ After the vegetable has been put on to cook, discuss the method \\'of seasoning or dressing the vegetable Which is to he served uncooked, and have it prepared to serve attractively on the plates. Especial emphasis should he placed on the use of fresh, green vegetables. -Continue the discussion of vegetables, having tho members of the* class suggest others that can bo prepared as a salad or cooked in the manner illustrated, writing the list on the blackboard for them to . copy in their books. • -When tho cooked vegetable is tender have it drained, seasoned, and served, and serve the uncooked vegetable atdhe same time. When ready for serving, have the pupils arrange their plates and • forjes carefully, then havo them all sit down but the two who pass the two vegetables. Be sure that the pupils eat carefully and n:ccly. Emphasize housework as on previous day. tyifiestims to serve as a guide in tho development of the lesson : -Potatoes a«a Source of Carbohydrates. The Choice, Cost, Care, Compos!t ion, Food Value, and Cooking of Sweet Potatoes and White Potatoes. Baked Squash, Steamed Squash* -( ‘^rbohydrates.—A third claAs of food Muffs required by the body is known as the carbohydrates or sugars and starches This class of foods is used as fuel for the production of heat and energy in the -. Potatoes. Potatoes are a cheap source of carbohydrates. They are also valuable for their mineral matter and for the Urge quantity of water which they contain. Three-fourths of thie potato is water. The framework of. tho potato has a basis of cellulose, which is an indigestible carbohydrate material. Potatoes havo only a smalf amount of cellulose. hdWever, and they are comparatively *asy of digestion. When dry and mealy they are most easy of digestion >vefct potatoes contain a larger per cent of sugar than whito potatoes and tho celluloao in sweet potatoes softens more quickly when cooking. When used for a meal, potatoes should be supplemented by some muscle-building food, such as milk, chcoSe, eggs, fish, or meat. -At some previous period the teacher should have discussed with the girltf the use .of potatoes and learn from them the various ways in which they cook them in their homes. She should \\'determine upon some recipes for tho lesson that will increase the variety of ways in which potatoes can be served and will improve the methods used. -cheapest and most commonly used in the community. The best methods of cooking and means of securing variety should he empha*>jzed. . 1 -Wash and pare potato*, boil, drain, dry, and mash (with a potato masher) iri the saucepan in which they were cooked. Beat them until very light and creamy; add hot milk, butter, and salt and beat again, reheat, and serve. Servos 6 to #. -Wash, scrub, and pare potatoes of uniform size. Parboil 10 minuloa, then put in , dripping pan with meat or on a rack in a baking jAui. -Cut cold boiled potatoes in one-fourth inch slices, season with salt and pepper put into a hot, well-greased frying pan. brown on oho side, turn and brown on the other mde. ° -Scrub, pare and boil potatoes 10 minutes in sal tod wato* drain, cut in halves lengthwise and put into a buttered baking pan. Make a sirup of sugar and water boil 3 minutes, add butter. Baste potatoes with sirup, put into a hot oven, cook 15 minutes, or until browned, basting every 5 minutes. \\' Serves 8 to 10. -Prepare squash aa for baking, put in steamer over boiling water, and cook.30 minutes or until soft. Then scrape squash from shell, maah. and season With butter salt and pepper. , ‘ , . * 1 -Wipe shell of squash cut it into pieces for serving, remove seeds and stringy portion place in a dripping pan, and bake in a slow oven three-quarters of an hour (until tender). Serve at once. v -Discuss the composition and structure if the potato. \\' Read over and discuss the recipes that are to be used. -Make . assignments for work. After the potato* have bepn put on to cook, have the class examine a raw potato, following the directions given . 1 . -If one of the recipes requires the use of tho oven, bo careful to hr.ve the potatoes for it prepared first and as quickly as possible. It may be. necessary to proceed with .another class, assigning one pupil to take care of the baking. Special attention should bo given to careful serving ojt tho potatoes. -Home assignment— Bofo^o the next lesson each pupil should be ablo to report that she has cobked potatoes at home, using the recipes . learned in class. . 1 -I and sudkCruits as Figs, Grapes, Muscadines, Apples, and Peaches. The I ^ Drying HRuits and Vegetables. -J< ruits impart pal stability and flavor to other foods and exerciso a favorable influence upon the digestive organs, though their food value is low. They contain a high percentage of w^ter and only a small percentage of nutrients. Most fruits are eaten raw. Raw fruits aro exceedingly valuable to the_ body because of the fresh | acids they contain.^ Cooking \\'softens the cellulose of the <|uit and, therefore, renders some fruits more easy of digestion. The cooking | of fruit is of value chiefly for the purpose of preservation. -The drying of fruits — Fruits are dried so that they may be pro\" served for use. Bacteria and molds, which cause the decay of fruits, need moisture for development and growth. If the moisture in fruits is evaporated, the fruits will keep indefinitely. Dried fruits and vegetables can be easily and inexpensively prepared, therefore the practice of (frying is feasible if one is so situated that the fruit or vegetable can be exposed to the hot sun in a clean, dry place. When dried fruits are to bo used? they must be washed thoroughly and soaked for several hours, or overnight, in water, so as to restore as much water as possible. They should\\\\ be cooked until soft irnthe samb water in which they are soaked. -Oanning and preserving . — Simple methods ofv preservation are % desirable in order that vegetables and fruits be made of value for a longer poriod of time than through their ripening season. Canning is one of the methods most commonly employed in the home, for it is easily done, and canned fruits will keep indefinitely. Fruit which is to be canned is first sterilized by boiling or steaming, in order to destroy all germs and spores. # This can be adequately accomplished by boiling 20 minutes, but a shorter time is sometimes sufficient, -All geons mast also be destroyed on the cans and on everything which comes in contact with the food in order to insure complete * -1 Jars, tops, dipper, and funnel should all bo placed in cold water, heated until water comes to the boiling point, and left in the water until just before sealing. \\' It will be sufficient to dip the rubbers into \\' ^ lc boiling water. After the fruit has been put into the can, it must he sealed so that it . is perfectly air-tight. . In order to do this, it is* necessary to haveteood tops, with hew, pliable rubbers, and to fit them tightly. -When the jar is to be filled, it should bey placed on a board dr wooden table, or on a doth wrung out of hot water r and filled to overflowing. -Sugar is not essential to sterilization and is used only to improve the flavor. .Both fruits and vegetables can he. canned without sugar^ However, fruits canned with a large amount of sugar do not spoil readily, for germs develop slowly in a thick sirup. -Methods of mnmng .— The simplest method of canning is the ppenkottlo method employed for small, watery fruits, sudi as berru^s, grapes, tomatoes, etc. The fruit is boiled in an open kettle (which permits of the evaporation of some of the water in the. fruit) and transferred at once to. a sterilized jar which is immediately sealed. The openkettle method of canning is not satisfactory for those vegetables containing only a small amount of acid, nor is it satisfactory for all fruits. A safer method and one that, secures moro complete sterilization without serious change of flavor in the fruit is that known as . the cold-pack method. Aftpr being transferred to the cans the vegetable or fruit, is subjected to an additional period of heating of considerable length, or to three periods of briefer length on three successive days. If the threo periods of sterilization are used, tho process is known as the intermittent method. -Tho single process method is described in the recipo for canned boots. x riie intermittent process proves ^moro satisfactory for canned beans. -.The teacher should ascertain what, fruits and vegetables are most abundant and scloct those that the ol&ss can provide for canning. -kach girl should he asked to bring some vegetable or fruit, some granulated ^ugar, and a jar in which to can her fruit. If the school does not possess enough kettles or saucepans in which to do tho cook*ing, kettles or saucepans may ho borrowed from tho homos. -Only one fruit or one vegetable should be taken up at a time, fo* the preparation necessarily varies slightly and the different methods will prove confusing. It is not necessary to confine the choice of fruits and vegetables to those mentioned in the recipes included. Tho teacher will find it necessary to base her instruction on tho products of tho particular time and place of the lessons The principles of canning should be taken up at somo other period, if possible, that the cooking losson may be devoted entirely to practical work. -Scald and peel the tomatoes. Boil 20 minutes. Sterilize the jare, covers, arid rubbpm. St^pd jare on a cloth in a pan of hot ^ater. Kill jare with hot tomatoes, being careful to fill to overflowing, and to expel all air bubbles from the jar. Adjust rubber and cover. Seal. Allow to cool. Test, label, and .set away in cool, dry, dark, place. -Squeeze the pulp of the grape« out of the skins. Cook the pulp 5 minutes and then mb throi^h-arin^^ that is fine enough to hold back the seeds. Put the water, skins, ami p*fp into the preserving kettle and heat slowly to the boiling point. Skim the fruit and then add ther sugar. Boil 15 minutes. Put into jars as directed. -Use firm, solid fruit. Peel and cut in half. If cling-stone peaches are used, they may bo canned whole. Fill each jar as the peaches are peeled and add water 96 that they will not discolor. When the jar is entirely tilled , put on the rubber and the lid, but do no fasteu the lid down . Then place the jar on a rack or folded cloth in a laige kettle that can bo closely covered. Put in enough water to reach up several inches oh the jars, cover the kettle, and bring the water to the boiling point. When hot, lift the lids and add sugar, if it is to be used, from one-fourth cup to one cup of sugar for each quart of fruit. When the boiling point is again reached, boil for 10 minutes; Fasten down fhe lids and boil for 10 minutes longer. Set in a place free from drafts. On two successive days return the jars to the kettle and boil for 20 minutes. Do not loosen the lids alter the jars have been scaled. -Boil the beets until they are throe-fourths done and the skins come off easily. Remove thojftins and pack the beets in a jar carefully. Cover with boiling water, to which one tablespoon of salt is added for each quart, put the top on the jar, but do not fasten it down. Place the jar on a rack or a folded cloth in a large kettle that can he closely covered. Pour enough water into the kettle to reach within 2 inches of the top of the jar, cover the kettle, bring^to the boiling point,* and boil 15 minutes, then fasten the hd on securely and boil for one and one-half hours or two hours. Put aside to cool in a place that is free from drafts. As the water around the jar boils down replenish with boiling water, never with cold. -Wash and string fresh, tender beans. Put into & sack or wire basket and dip into boiling water for 10 minutes. Drain, cool slightly, and pack in jars, within 1 inch of the top. Add one-fourth teaspoonful of salt to cachr pint jar and fill with cold water. Put on the rubbers and lids, but do not fasten the lids down. Then place the jars on a rack or folded cloth in a large kettle that can be closely covered. Pour enough water V lto the t0 reach »P within 2 inches of the top of the jars, cover the kettle, bring to the boiling point, and boil for 15 minutes. Then fasten on the lids and boil for 4$ minutes.

It will give the girLs an interesting problem. -Preparation of White Sauce to<Scrve with Vegetables, and Serve such Vegetables as Lima or Butter Beans, peas, Onions, Okra, Cabbage, Collards, Corn, Beets, -Pats and oils . — Butter and cottonseed oil belong to the class of foodstuffs known as fats and oils. They increase! the fuel value of those dishes to which they are added. \\' -^ Fats supply heat and energy to tho body in concentrated form, hor this reason they should he used in limited quantity. Fats undergo several changes during the process of digestion, and the excessive use of fat interferes with the digestion of other foods and throws a large amount of work upon the digestive organs. Cooked fats arc more difficult for-the digestive organs to usd* than uncooked fats. Other foods cooked with the hot. fat arc rendered difficult of digestion. -, Vegetables . — Vegetables should be usfed when in season, as they are always cheapest and at their best then. They keep best if in a cold, dry, and dark place. • , -It is necessary to cook most vegetables, because they contain cellulose^ and raw starch, which are indigestible. In old or exceedingly large vegetables the cellulose may be very tough; hence long. -caking is necessary. They should be cooked only until they are tender. Longer cooking may destroy. the flavor, render the vegetable difficult of digestion, and .cause the color to change. In vory young vegetables the cellulose is delicate, and if young vegetables do not contain much starch they may be eaten raw. -When cooked vegetables are served they are usually seasoned and dressed with butter or oil (for one cup vegetables use $ teaspoon stilt, $ teaspoon pepper, and \\\\ tables)>oon fat or oil), or a sauce is prepared to serve them. -It may be well to have a preliminary lesson devoted to the simple experiments with flour, liquid, and fat, in order to determine the best method of combining white sauce. Howeveiy if the lesson period is of sufficient length a few of these experiments can be per/ formed in connection with the lesson. -There should he provided for the lesson some vegetable that is improved by serving with white sauce, and sufficient milk, butter, or ot her fat, flour, and salt for the sauce and the experiments.

Oatmeal, Cracked Wheat, Hominy Qrits, Corn-meal Mush, Rice. Fruits to Serve with Cereals — Stewed Prunes, Stewed Apples, or Apple Sauce. -The term “cereals\" is applied to the cultivated grasses— rice, wheat, corn, rye, oats, and buckwheat. They are widely grown throughout the temperate zone and are prepared in varied forms for use as food. Cereals contain a high per cent of starch and a low per cent of water, with varying proportions of mineral matter and fat. In addition to these four foodstuffs already studied, cereals contain H small amount of another foodstuff known as protein, a musclebuilding material. For tho most part the cereals contain a largo amount of celluloso, which is broken up during the process of preparation for market and requires long cooking before ready for use by the body. Tho digestibility of the cereals depends upon the amount of celluloso which they contajn and tho thoroughness of cooking. Cereals are palatablo and they are valuablebocauso they can hti blended in various ways with other substances in cooking. They are beneficial to tho body bocauso they act mechanically on the digestive organs to stimulate*, them. Tho cereal is made more attactivo by serving a fresh or cooked fruit as an accompaniment. -The coroals should be discussed in a nature study or geography lesson, and two or throe kinds that arc commonly used should be brought from the homes by the girls. If cereals are not commonly used as breakfast foods, the lesson can bo a means of introducing them. Some girls should bring, a littlo milk and sugar to serve with the cooked cereal. Apples or prunes should be brought to cook and servo with the cereal. • -Bpil JO minuUM, stirring constantly, then cook slowly,. preferably over water at SOTes°sfx a \" d ° ne \\' h f h ° UrB l0ngCr; thQ flavor is deve| 0P^ by ‘ longer cooking. -Boil 10 minutes, stirring constantly, then cook slowly throe hours longer, preferably over water.

Meat, fish, poultry, eggs, cheese, milk, cereals, legumes, and. nuts are classed as protein foods. -f rhosc foods which serve sploly as fuol for the body — providing heat and energy — are classed under two groups: The carbohydrates (sugar and starches), which the body is. able to use in relatively large quantities; and the fats ’and oils, which the body can not use in such large quantities, but whic]i yield a large amount of heat and energy. ’Protein also serves as fuel, though tissue building is regarded as its* special function. Sugars and starches are abundant in fruits and vegetables. Fats and oils are found in meats, fish, milk, %nd in some vegetable foods. Heat-giving food may be stored in the body as fatty tisspe.\\' -Minoral compounds must be\\' present in our food to help iif the regulation of the body processes and to enter into the composition of \\' ihe structure and the fluids of the body. Mineral compounds are best supplied by the fresh green vegetables, fruits, and milk. . • -Water is absolutely essential to the body and is present in large quantity in many foods, and is combined with many\\'other foods during the processes of cooking. # -One or more of the foodstuffs sometimes predominate in a single food. For example, rice is almost entirely carbohydrate; buttek -almost pure fat. Occasionally we find a food that contains all the \"« five groups of food principles. Milk is an example of such a . food \\' and milk contains all five food principles in such proportion as to : supply all the nourishment which the baby needs during the early months of its life. As the baby grows older, foods rich in carbohy\\' drates must be added to the diet in order to supply a sufficient amount of energy for activity. Wheat contains all that the body -Ohmce r offond . — Our diet must be carefully chosen to give a needed variety and to properly combine the foods so. that wo may have the right amount of all the foodstuffs. Each meal should contain sdme protein food, some fats or carbohydrates, some mineral matter, and water. All five forms of foodstuffs must occur in tho day’s diet. Ther greater part of the Water whifcb the body needs should be taken • between meals. . , ( -^Fanners’ Bulletins: No.142, Principles of nutrition and nutritive valued ; No. 712, School lunches; No. 808, How to select foods.

Discuss simple combinations for the different meals, using dishes already prepared in the course and creating an interest in other recipes to be prepared in the succeeding lessons. -Experience has shown that some foods are more acceptable at one timo of day than other foods, and that foods , are more pleasing in certain combinations than in others. The choice of food will also depend upon the season of the year. For example, a breakfast is made up of simplo foods that are not highly seasoned nor subjected to elaborate methods of cooking. A fruit, a cereal, and bread, with j possibly eggs or meat, are served at breakfast. A beverage, usually hot, is^ajdded to breakfast by most people.’ -Fundamentally, dinner consists of a hot meat or other protein dish with one or two vegetables. Soup, salad, and a sweet dessert are often served with the dinner. The soup is served before the meat \\' course and the salad and dessert follow the meat course. The dessert may be a fruit, a cooky, or other pastry, a pudding or a frozen dish. 1 -Lunch or supper may be a very simple meal, consisting of a soup with crackers, one protein dish (eggs, milk, or meat) with bread and stewed fruit, or a salad with a simple dessert. -See Farmers’ Bulletins: No. 717, Food foi; young children; No. 808, How to select foods; No. J, What the body needs. -The table should always be neatly set with individual places arranged for each one who is to partake of the meal. /Each place should bo wide enough for a plate with a knife and spoon at the right and a tork. at the left. A tumbler should ‘be placed at the point of the knife and a napkin at the left of the fork.Everything placed on the table should be perfectly clean, the napkin should be neatly folded, and all tho articles should be uniformly arranged to give a neat appearance to the table. . A flower, or plant in the center of the table will add to its attractiveness. Salt, pepper, sugar, vinegar, and anything of the sort that may be needed with the meal should be arranged noar the iccnter of tho table where it can be easily reached. Fresh water should be poured into the tumblers just before the meal is served. The bread, butter, etc., can be placed on the table several miputes before the meal is announced, but the hot dishes should be placed immediately before the family ia seated. -If hoss° n VI, entitled “Setting and Clearing the Table” (as outlined in the course on the care of the home), has been given, this lesson can be devoted to what to serve and how to serve it, or this lesson can precede the lesson on table service. The manner of serving can be demonstrated in the next lesson in connection with the courso in the care of the home; -Simple equipment for family service will be required if the form of serving is to bo taken up. For class practice a tuble\\'for four can be arranged. This will necessitate a table cover, five or more dinner plates, four butter dishes or plates, four tumblers, four cups and saucers, four knives, four forks\\', four teaspoons, four napkins, a platter, -ono serving spoon, and one serving fork. -biscuss meal service both from the standpoint of choice and combination of foods and from the method of sorvicc. Have the class plan one meal, then go through the form of serving that meal at a table. In the absence of a table the top of the desks cah be used for a table. Later in the course the teacher should plan to combine this • lesson with a cooking lesson and have the food served, In each cooking lesson suggestions for the service of tho.food should be made and each cooked dish should be carefully served. . Interest in this lesson may bo increased by Rowing the children to make original menus, hnd,if they are having some lessons in drawing, simple menu cards may be planned and executed. ’ -Care, Cost, and Pood Value of Milk. Value and Use of Sour Milk— Cot; u 8 e Cheese, Clabber. Rice or Cornstarch Pudding (Plain, Caramel, or -Milk contains all the foodstuffs which the, body requires, and there■\\'“fqre is capable of sustaining life for comparatively long periods. It is one of the most important protein foods, but it contains so small-a per cent of carbohydrate (milk sugar) that for the adult it must he supplemented with carbohydrate foods. For the baby, milk is a perfect food, and it is a valuable adjunct to the diet of all children. One quart of milk should be allowed for the diet of each child daily after the twelfth month. The diet of the adult can well be supplc; “cntcd by the use of milk. The greatest care should be exercised to protect milk from dust and dirt, forit is easily contaminated and may j be the moans of carrying disease germs to the body. The Changes j which milk undergoes When souring do nob\\' render it harmful to the body. For many people buttermilk is more easy of digestion than sweet milk, because \\'of \\'tho changes produced bysouring and the absence ; of fat. Sour milk is of value\\' in cooking, producing a tender bread which can readily be made fight by the addition of soda— one teaspoon of soda to 1 pint of sour milk that has clabbered. -In the preparation of cheese, the whey is separa\\'ted from the curds, thus extracting, most of the water, sugar, and salts, and leaving a substance rich in protein and fat. Cheese is of value in cooking, for it increases the food value of those fopds to which it is added. -The teacher should make inquiries a few days in advance to bo sure that 1 quart of sour milk can bo secured, and whon it is brought, she should examine it to see that it is in proper condition to make cottage cheese. She should arrange to have about 1 quart of sweet milk brough t and such other supplies as are necessary for tho pudding. -. ’ Opportunity can be found to discuss tho use of left-over cereal by the preparation of the rice pudding, if tho teacher provides somo cold cooked rice for the lesson. In the absence of cold rice, the cornstarch pudding can be prepared. -Heat sour milk slowly until the whey rises to the top, pour the whey off, put the c^rd m a bag and let it drip for six hours without squeezing. Put the curd into a bowl and break fine with a wooden spoon; season with salt, and mix intoa paste with a little cream or butter. Mold into balls, if desired, and keep in a cold place fit is best when fresh.)\\' ‘ -See Farmer’s Bulletin Wo. 363, The Use of Milk as Food; No, 487, Cheese and its .

While cheese is draining, make assignments and have tho rice or cornstarch pudding made. -Discuss food value of milk and its use in cooking. Discuss the food voluo and purposes for which skimmed milk and sour milk can be used in cooking. -Cream soups .— Tho strained pulp of cooked vegetables, greens, or cereals, with an equal portion of thin white sauce, is the basis for cream soups. -A binding of butter and flour is used to prevent a separation of the thicker and the thinner parts of soup. This is combined as for white sauce and poured into the rest of the hot liquid just before the soup is to be Berved. The soup should not be allowed to boil after the .vegetable pulp ap,d milk have been combined, but kept hot oyer -water. The acid present in nearly all vegetables is very apt to produce a curdling in the milk if too high a temperature is maintained after they are combined. -Two -tablespoons of flour to each quart of soup is a good proportion to observe for thickening all vegetable soups that are not of a starchy nature; half that amount will be sufficient for soup prepared from a very starchy vegetable. -Attractive cream soups can be prepared from left-over vegetables ami a combination of flavors may give good results. -Accwmpanirnen&s.-^Tisp crackers, croutons, soup sticks,* or bread sticks fire served as accompaniments with cream soups and are valuable because they necessitate thorough mastication, thus inducing, the flow of the saliva and aiding in the digestion of the starchy ingredients of the soup. -\\'Hie teacher should secure a vegetable that the girls have for use in their own homes as a basis for the soup, and crackers or bread to serve with the soup. -If dried peas are used, they should be put to soak the night before ami put on to cook early in the morning. * -It will be well to have the cooking of the carrots begun before the lesson period.

Though lacking in carbohydrates, they furnish material for building up the muscles and provide heat and energy to the body. If cooked at a low temperature, eggs are very -easily and very completely digested.

They build up the \\' muscular tissue, furnish host and eiieigy, are more stimulating and strengthening than any other food, and satisfy hunger for a greater length of .time. For the mbst part, meats are a very expensive food. One can not perform more labor by use of a meat diet than on a diet of vegetable fbods.,,. Those who use largo quantities of meat in . their diet suffer from 4 many disturbances of the system. Hence, meats should form a, very small part of the diet.

A half hour before opening the morning^ession or a portion of the morning or noon recess may be sofli\\'eient to pui the meat on to cook and to prepare the vegetables. When the second class period is called, the vegetables should be added to the partially cooked moat and the dumplings made. It would be well to serve tho completed dish at the lunch period. There should be as much discussion of the kinds of meat, their food value, and methods of cooking as time permits, but it may be necessary to complete these discussions at some other class periods. -Should it be possible for the teacher to give additional lessons oh -meat, it may bo well to devote one lesson to the preparation and cooking of poulti a v« directions for which can be easily secured from reliable cookbooks. -Peas, beans, and lentil^ which are dried for market contain a high percentage of protein, carbohydrate, and mineral matter.

It would be well to serve the dish at the lunch period. Have the corndodgers prepared to serve with the baked beans or cowpeas. -Cakes, Cakes made with fat resemolo other batters, except that the fat, sugar, and eggs are usually larger in amount and the texture of the baked batter is much finer and more tender. -When preparing cake, first get the pans re.ady, greasing them with the same kind of fat that is to be used in the mixture, or sprinkle with flour, or line with greased paper. Make sure that the oven is at the proper temperature. For a small cake the oven should be hot enough to brown a small piece of unglazed paper or a tablespoon of flour in three minutes. Bake a small cake 20 to 30 minutes\\'. When done, the cake will shrink from the sides of the pan; the crust will spring back when\\' touched with the finger; the loud ticking sound will cease; a needle or straw will come out clean if the cake is pierced, and the crust will be nicely browned. When the cake is removed from the oven, let it stand in the pan about three minutes, then loosen and turn out gently. Do not handle while hot. Keep in a clean, ventilated tin box in a cool, dry place! -Cocoa.— Chocolate and cocoa are \\'prepared from the bean of a tropical tree. This bean is rich in protein, fat, carbohydrate, mineral matter, and a stimulant called theobromine. The seeds are cleaned, milled, and crushed into a paste in the preparation of chocolate.\\' In the preparation of cocoa much of the fat is removed and the cocoa is packed for market in the form of a fine powder. Cocoa is more easy of digestion than chocolate, becauso it is less rich. Though the amount of cocoa used in a \\'cup of the beverage is not large, when prepared with milk it serves as a nutritious /ood. It is slightly stimulating as well, because of the theobromine present and because it is served hot. -Coffee and Tea . — Coffee and tea have no food value when prepared as a beverage. They contain stimulating properties that are harmful to the body if taken in lurge quantities, hence they should be used, with discretion. They should never be given to children or to. those troubled with indigestion. If carelessly prepared, both coffeef fend tea may be decidedly.harmful tp the body. Coffee should not be boiled for more than eight minutes. Tea should nover be perimtted to boil. Freshly boiling water should be poured on the |eaves and left for three minutes. It should then be strained off -Bogin the lesson period with a discussion of the methods of preparing cukes and put the cake in the oven as soop ns possible. While it is baking prepare the cocoa. If the cocoa is not to bo served for some time, it can be kep\\'t hot or reheated over hot water. -\\\\ cast broad is made light by the presence of a gas produced by the growth of yeast in the sponge or dough. Yeast is a microscopic plant which grows in a moist, warm temperature and feeds on starchy materials such as arp present in wheat. A portion of jho starch is converted into sugar (thusjdeveloping new and pleasant flavors), and some is £till further changed, giving off the gas upon which the lightness of t he bread depends. If the yeast is allowed to grow too long a time or the temperatdre is very Jiot, a souring of the dough may result. This souring can be prevented by kneading the dough thoroughly as \\'soon as it has risen well or doubled in bulk or by putting it in a very hot oven to hake when it has reached this stage. If tho dough becomes chilled, the yeast will not grow so well, and if the temperature of tfye dough should become hot \\'the activities of the yeast would become arrested. ^ b iling temperature will destroy the growth of the yeast. -Yeast develops in a natural state on the hops and other plants. It is prepared for market in the form of dry. or moist cakes. The moist cakes must be kept very cold. For home use a liquid yeast is often prepared from, the dry cakes. This has the advantage, of being more active. * \\' -When the yeast has been added to a batter ittis spoken of as a sponge. When the batter has had enough flour added so that it can be handled it is called a dough. If the bread is to be made in a few hours, the yeast is made up at once into a dough. If it is to stand overnight, a spofige is often started first. More yeast is required for quick rising. Under ordimmy circumstances one yeast cake is sufficient for 1 quart of liquid. Thorough kneading and baking are both essential to the success of the bread. -Arrange to\\' have the class meet th© afternoon before to\\' start tjne. sponge^and come early in the morning to care for the dough. Begin the study of flour, yeast, and bread in a previous class period, cor* relating th© work -with geography, nature study, or some other subject* ^ lather .whit© or whole-wheat flour m&y be ^ped for th© breads. -At n.» »i put a dry yeast cake to soak in a cup of warm water.

Mix thoroughly and knead it into a smooth dough, and continue. until it is soft and elastic. Return dough to the bowl, moisten, cover, and set in a moderately warm place for the night. Re sure that the place is free from drafts, In^hc morning knead slightly; divide into loaves or shape in biscuite; put into pans for baking; cover and let rise until double iu bulk. Bake large joaves\\'50 to GO minutes. Biscuits will bake in from 25 to 35 minutes, for they require a hotter oven. (Makes 4 loaves i. It is of utmost importance that all yeast breads be thoroughly cooked. -Fut tfte hot water or milk, salt, sugar, and fat in\\'a bowl; when lukewarm add the yeast softened iu the lukewarm water, then the flour gradually, and when stiff enough to handle, turn dough out on floured board-and knead until soft and elastic (20 minutes i.

(Makes 2*loaves.) -See Farmers’ Bulletins j No. 380, Bread aiid bread making; No. 807, Bread\\' and bread making in the home. * -If the class is large, prepare two or three bowls of sponge, so that all can have some experience in stirring and kneading. Do not make too large a quantity of bread to bake in the oven uiilfcss arrangements can be made to do some of the baking at the near-by home of one of the girls. Use the bread for the school lunch or divide it among the girls to take homto. -At sonic previous timo tho teacher should talk over the plana for the dinner with the girls. It will ho well to let them ask tho members of the school hoard or other people interested in their work to partake of tho dinner. They should decido on the menu with help, and suggestions from the teacher. They should choose foods that they can bring from their homes. The main course of tlic dinner should consist of such a vegetable dish as baked beans, cowpeas, an qmelet, or macaroni with whito sauce ami grated cheese. To accompany it there should be potatoes and a fresh green vegetable, such ns spinach or cabbage niul a hot bread. -A simple dessert which tho girts know how to make shoA.be chosen: One duty should bo assigned to each girl and she (mould he entirely responsible for that portion of the work. Tho toachor should supervise all the work carefully.. -\\' Tho girls may be -able to make, simple menu cards for the, dinner. The work, of making the, cards can be taken up in a drawing lesson. -Melt the butter, add the flour and seasonings, combine thoroughly, then add the hpt milk slowly. Separate the eggs; beat the yolks, and add the white sauce to them. Peat the whites until stiff and cut and foM them carefully into the yolk mixture so that the lightness is all retained. Turn into a greased baking dish and bake in a moderate oven 20 to 30 minutes. Serve hot. Serves 6. -Break the macaroni in 1-inch pietes and cook it in a largo amount of boiling water salted 30 to* 45 minutes., Drain it well when tender and pour cold water through it. -Orate the cheese, break up the bread crumbs, and add. two tablespoons melted butter to them. Make a white fauce of the fat, flour, Reasonings, and milk.

Serves 8* -Food value and cooking. The use of peanuts in candy. Peanut c<K>kies, or peanut, molasses, or fudge candies to be made for a special entertain* ment. -Sugfir is valuablo to *tho body as a source of heat and energy. \\' While it is easy of digestion, it is very irritating to the body if taken in largo quantities, and hence it should be taken in small quantities and preferably at meal time or with other food. Two or tj^rcc pieces of candy taken at tho end of tho meal will not be harmful, but candy eaten habitually between meals is sure to produce harmful effects in the body. Large quantities of candy are’ always disturbing to the body. , . -Sugar is present inTmany -fruits and some vegetables. Milk contains a good per cent of sugar. In preparing foods to which the addition of sugar seems desirable, care should bo taken not to add it in large quantities. -As it is desirable to have a discussion of sugar and its value to the body, the preparation of cookies or candy for somo school function or Christmas party can bo undertaken in conjunction with this lesson. The lesson should bo given at a time when it will mean most to tho girls. The work should be so planned that the girls will learn something of the principles) of sugar cookery as well as the specific recipes they are using, ’v. 1 h . -(Yearn the butter, add sugar and welbbeaten eggs.

The girls should be encouraged to learn to sew, both to improve their own homo conditions and to give them suggestion for a possible means of livelihood. -If sewing machines are available and aro jn use in the homes represented in the school, it is well to have lessons given in machine sew\\' ing and to have tho long seams run by machine. If the girls can not have sewing machines in their own homes, tho lessons given should . be limited to hand sewing. In sonic schools it may bo necessarv to simplify the lessons; in others an increased number of articles may bo prepared in the time allotted. Should the apron and -cap not l>e needed for the cooking class, an undergarment (petticoat) can well be substituted. -The teacher should have a definite plan of procedure in mind for each lesson. The lesson should be opened with a brief and concrete class discussion of the new work that is to be taken up or tho special stage that has been reached in work that is already under way. Though individual instruction is necessary, it should not take tho j place of this general presentation of subject matter, which economizes , time and develops the real thought content of tho work. -New stitches can be demonstrated on large pieces o( muslin with long darning needles , and rod orblack Germantown yarn. \\'Hie muslin may he pinned to the blackboard with thumb tacks and tho ** stitches made large enough for all to see without difficulty. A variety of completed articles should bo kept on hand to show additional application of points brought out jn tho. lesson. Each class may be givon the privilege of preparing one artido to add to this colj lection, and a spirit of class pride and valuable team work thereby developed. ‘ -\\' During the lesson, posture, neatness, and order should be emphasized. Application can bo secured, by making tho problems of interest. Care must he taken that none of tho work demands unnecessary eye strain. Each lesson should be closed in time to have ono of the members of the class give d brief summary of the steps that have been covered. -Since the class period for sewing in tho rural school will necessarily be brief, the girls can bo encouraged to continue their work at some other period. However, no work outside of the class period should be permitted until tho pupil has mastered the stitch and can bo trusted to do the work in the right way. Thp privilege. of sewing can be made tho reward for lessons quickly learned, home practice can be assigned, or the class can meet out of school hours. All outside ^^.^practice must be carefully supervised, the pupil bringing her work to ,.the teacher for frequent inspection. • j -If it is possible to keep on hand a permanent equipment for Bowing, the following should bo provided for a class of 12: -Tho teacher who is to give lessons in sowing should secure a helpful elementary textbook on sewing or some bulletin that deals with the\\' teaching of sewing. Such bulletins are issued in some States by the extension departments of tho State university, college, or normal schools.

Discussion of hemming. Hems folded on sheets of paper. „ -A hem is a fold used to finish a cut surface, .made by twice turning over the edge of a piece of cloth toward the worker, and then sewing it down. In turning a narrow hem the first fold must be less deep than the second, v in order that the hom may lie smoothly. If the hem is a wide one, the first fold cap be much less deep than the second. -The teacher should have interested the children in tho sewing lessons before the first meeting of the class, and each girl should be asked to come to class with the box in which to keep her materials and such other equipment as is required. If tho school is to furnish the equipment, tho .teacher should bo sure that there is an ade(juato amount on hand. -It will probably be necessary to have towels hemmed to bo used m the cooking classes at school, and the girls shoukl be interested in doing the hemming. If some of the girls want to hem towels for use in their own ^ojnes, it will be desirable to allow them to do so. Flour or meal sacks will answer. It may bo well to have the , gu)a«ach hem* toy cl for home use as well as for school use, in order to impress them with the desirability of having hemmed dish towels for daily use. The towels can be planned. during this lesson and the girls can arrange to bring tho material from home, if they are to provido them. It will be well for the teacher to have material • for one or two towels already on hand. Plain paper will answer for the practice folding of the hem in tho first lesson. ^ -hands should be for the sewing lesson. Each giriahotrii aspect her own hands and show them to the teacher. -When sure that all the girls have their hands in proper condition for sowing, the teacher should look over their supplies with them -Noxt sho should tell them what their first work is to be, shew the material for the towels, and discuss with them the best method of finishing the ends of the toweJs. (See Lesson II ) -Before turning the hem the girls should make a canlboard ruler’ from heavy paper and notched to indicate the depth of the hem. -1 fow mum tes should be devo\\'ted to practice ra measuring and turning a hem the desired depth on a sheet of paper.

The canvas should bo pinned to the blackboard, where tho class can see it easily. -As soon as class is called, supplies are at hand, and hands are in proper condition, the teacher should demonstrate tho basting stitch, with a large needle and thread on the square of canvas that has been fastened on the wall.

The dimensions of the finished bag should be about 12 by 18 inches. -The girls should get out th\\'e materials they have brought, for their bags and determine upon their size and shape. It will not be noceasory for them to make bags of uniform shape and size. Tho teacher should help them to use their material to the best advantage. The material should \"be straightened, pulled in place, and measured care^ fully. ^ When the bags have, been cut out, the sides should be \\'basted up. * •* -Running is done by passing the needle in and out of ‘the material at regular intervals. Small, even stitches and spaces should follow consecutivoly on both sides of the material. The stitches should bo much shorter than for basting, the length being determined largely ty (^he kind ,of cloth used. * * --When running is combined with\\'a back stitch, two or more running stitches and one back; stitch are taken alternately.

After the seams have been overcast, she should discuss with the»girls the depth of the hem that they expect to use and the method of turning and basting it. The girls should turn and baste the hems, using the cardboard measure for securing the depth of the hem. If the bags are deep enough to admit of °a heading at the top, a deep hem (about 2£ inches) can be made and a running stitch put in one-half inch (or -more) above the edge of the hem t^ provide a casing or space for the cord. If it *is necessary to take a* narrow hem, the hem itself can be made to answer aS space for the cord ; in this case the hem should bo made abput one-half inch deep. # -The teacher should review briefly with the girls-\\'the method of .making the hemming stifch and the running stitch, asking them to describe these stitches and to demonstrate them on the large square of canvas before the class. The basted hems should then be sewed down with the hemming st itch. -After the hem is finished the girls should run a basting thread around the bag to mark the location of the running stitch that is to be half an inch above the hem. They should measure for this carefully with the cardboard rule. -If there is not time to do all the hemming in the class period, the ‘ hemming stitch and the running stitch (t lint is to provide space for the ‘draw string) should be assigned \\'for outside work,\\' and each girl should bring in her finished hem at a designated timtf before the next class period. \\' -« Preparing^ cord pr other draw string for the jag.

I have taken for granted that the reader knows nothing whatever about the material and have explained each progressive step in the various operations throughout in detail. These directions I have supplemented with -The method of using wire forms as a base on which to build up the finished piece is original with myself as far as I know, as is also the development of color work in cement. The chapter on the latter as well as those on Garden Furniture should appeal strongly to the professional as well as the layman inasmuch as there is a large and growing demand for this class of work. -The amateur craftsman who has been working in clay will especially appreciate the adaptability of concrete for pottery work inasmuch as it is a cold process throughout, thus doing away with the necessity of kiln firing, which is necessary with the former material. -The textures which can be obtained on articles made of concrete, as described in the chapter on aggregates, in many instances are far superior to those which can be obtained with any other materials, as they have a distinct characteristic of their own and are full of life and sparkle. -If the reader derives as much pleasure as the author has done in experimenting with the material and in making the various articles described throughout the following pages the purpose of this work will have been accomplished. -Fig. 64 — Plaster Case Being Cast on INIodtl over Clay. ... ;g Fig. 65— Model in Position to ha\\\\e Upper Half Covered -Few people realize that anything of an artistic nature can be made from Portland cemsnt. Most of us are used to looking upon this material as fit only for heavy work, such as foundations for buildings, bridge abutments, piers, etc. It is not remarkable, then, that the layman does not knowthat cement if used properly can be made to compare more than fa\\\\orably with ornaments made from other and much more expcnsixe materials; for even those who are in the trade, and ^\\\\•ork■ nig with it every day, know nothing of the -wonderful and endless ^\\'ariety of artistic effects -which can be procfuced with Portland cemei-it. -The author for se\\\\-en years has followeil the Portland-cement co)-icrete indiistr\\\\\\' n-iore or less closely, and for the past two years has dc\\\\-otcd his entire attention to it. Some time ago he started experimentiiig with concrete pottery, and the experiments coi-iducted along this line ha-\\\\-e developed some very ii-itcrestlng and practical results. -The method of n-iakii-ig cement pottery is simple when understood; and if the craftsman follows the directions as given in the following chapters, he will find it easy to produce results Avhich are fully worth while. Each step in the operation from the raw materials to the finished product will be explained in detail, including the -Portland-cement mortar has peculiar characteristics of its own. It is unlil<;e clayTherefore in modeling it has to be worked differently. In modeling clav one can form it into any shapie, and it ^^■ill remain there, for the reasopi that it is more or less sticky, and the various particles of M\\'hich It is made up cling or adhere to one another, and thus hold the entire mass together. Portlandcement mortar, of ^\\'^•hich cement pottery is made, IS composed of a mixture of sand or marble dust and pure Portland cement mixed together in ^-arious proportions. This mixture is wet down with water, and then by turning o\\\\qv and troweling, IS made into a plastic mass called cement mortar. It is next to impossible to model in this material, for the reason that unless it is placed in a mold or a form is used to hold it in shape, while in its plastic state, it ^^\\'ill fall down. The first step then in cement pottery work is to make the form. -There are se\\\\\\'eral methods of making forms. One is to make wire frames on which to build up the cement mortar, and another is to make \\\\\\'(\\'ooden or pilaster molds. In the latter method the cement is handled in an entirely different manner from that used for the former. 7 he use of wire forms is the simpler when there are but one or tv,-o of the same shape of articles to be made. When a quantity of one kind is to be made it pays \\\\\\\\ell to spend some time m making a Mooden -or plaster piece mold, as it can be used over and over again, whereas when wire forms are used a new form has to be made for each article, whether of the same shape or not. -The best material for making wire forms is No. 20 Clinton wire lath having about a half-inch mesh. This can be procured at almost any hardware store. When buying it ask for galvanized wire lath, as this is better and easier to work with than the ungalvanized. If not familiar with this -material the accompanying illustrations will gi\\\\\"e a good idea of Mhat is to be used. The only tool necessary is a good strong pair of tinners\\' shears for cutting the wire, or better still, a combination wire cutter and nippers, as this will answer for two purposes. In the accompanying half-tone illustration. Fig. i, are shown two complete frames, one for a square and the other for a -round piece of pottery. The latter form is composed of a round piece for the bottom and a long narrow piece for the sides. (See Fig. 3.) -To make a wire form 5 inches in diameter by 4 inches high: First cut a piece of the wire lath large enough on which to lay out a 5-inch circle. Hammer it out until it is perfectly flat, and then place the point of the dividers in the intersection of the wires near the middle of the piece. Set -the dividers to a 2jj-inch radius, and scribe the circle. A piece of red or black chalk is best for this purpose, as It will make more distinct marks. Now take the wire cutters and cut the wire directly at the marks, and you will have the bottom of the frame complete. -The diameter of the bottom being 5 inches, the piece necessary for the sides of the frame will ha\\\\\\'c to be three times this length, or 1 1; Inches. -Make it 17 inches long, thus allowing i inch for lap, and j _. inch of surplus wire on each end, as indicated at a — a. The height of the finished form is to be four inches. Cut the wire lath to 4,\\'S inches, leaving a series of wire strands half -an inch long at the bottom as indicated. No-w take this piece which has been prepared for the sides and coax it into a circle by placing a straight edge (a piece of wood or metal having straight edges) successi\\\\-el)\\' along each of the meshes and pulling up on the free enci of the Avire lath as indicated in ¥\\\\g. 4. After the piece Is fairly well formed, lap the ends over, thus forming the circle, and secure them firmly to the main body of the sides by turning the free ends of the wire around the strands of the wire mesh, using the nippers to clinch them tightly. After ha\\\\\\'ing completed the side the bottom is placed in position, and the half-Inch lengths of wire left at the bottom of the sides are used to wrap around the -bottom and secure it In place. It is not essential to have this frame absolutely round or true, as it is used merely as a surface on which to build up the cement. The cement when once in place can be trued up by methods which will be explained in the next chapter. The square frame ^^hich is also illustrated is made in a similar manner. Care -must be taken, however, to get the corner lines perpendicular to the base, for if this is not done it will cause trouble later on Avhen truing up the sicies. -In cutting the wire lath for the sides of the rectangular frame, as indicated in Pig. 6, do not forget to make it at least two inches longer than -the sum total of the four sides. This will allow plenty for the lap and for the wire strands which are to be used for securing the ends in place. Of course, one need not confine himself to round and square forms, as innumerable sizes and shapes of frames can be made up, such as octagons, hexagons, etc., as well as forms for \\\\\\'ases with gracefully cur\\\\-ed outlines, as sho«\\'n in the accompanying illustrations. -The next chapter will treat of the method of applying the cement mortar aiul the forming of the finished pottery. -I he next step is the co\\\\-ering of the forms with the cement mortar. Ihe first operation is the application of a roughing or scratch coat. The mortar for the scratch coat should be made of one part Portland cement and two p>arts of fairlv fine, clean sand. This is known as a i-to-2 mixture. I he cement and sand should be thoroughly mixed together while dry, and to this mixture before wetting should be added enough plasterer\\'s hair to bind the particles together. Goat\\'s hair is the best to use. It can be procured at almost any plasterer\\'s or mason supply dealer\\'s. It comes in matted bunches, which should be pickeci apart and the hair separated before adding to the cement and sand. The M\\'hole should then be M\\'ct down M\\'ith ^^•ater and thoroughly mixed. Be careful not to get the mixture too wet, for if so it will not hang to the forms. The proper consistenc\\\\\\' is tliat of a stiff paste. Probably the best tool to apply this mortar to small work is an ordinary table knife; for large work a regular mason\\'s troAvel or float may be used. Take as much of the mortar as can con\\\\-eniently be handled on the end of the knife, and commencing at the bottom of the sides of the frame, force the mortar «el] in between the meshes of the form. Continue this ojieration until the entire sides of -the frame are covered. Then turn the frame bottom side up, and cover the bottom in Hke manner. The rougher the surface, the better. Do not do anything to the inside of the frame as yet. After having completely co\\\\ered the frame as described above, let the mortar set or harden, so that it will be securely cemented to the wire frame. In about four or five hours the mortar \\\\y\\\\]\\\\ ha\\\\c hardened sufficiently, so that the form can again be handled with safety. -The finishing coat can then be applied. The mortar for the fmishmg coat can be made of a number of different ingredients, all of -ixliich will produce a different result as far as texture and color are concerneil. d he method of apphiiig the fuiish coat, ho\\\\\\\\\\'e\\\\er, is the same in all cases, dherefore to start with, we will make the mortar to be used for the finish coat of the following mixture : I part of Portlantl cement and 2 pai-fs nt marlile dust. 1 his mixture \\\\\\\\ill produce a fairb, light surface A^-hen drietl OLit, and one -which is full of sparkle. It should be mixed to the cimsistency of a hea\\\\\\'v paste as before. The method of applying the finish coat and forming the jar to the tlcsired sliape is as folloAAS: -First cut a piece of wood, say \\' i inch thick, into a ciixle ha\\\\-ing a diameter about -^s or \\' _. iiur, larger than the greatest diameter of the rough coat, which is already placed in the wire form. Now with a pair of di\\\\-iders find the approximate center of the bottom of the rough-surfaced con-. -Crete frame, and put a small hole through the mortar at this point as Avell as at another point near the circumference. Take the circular piece of wood and drive a nail through its center, and m turn place this nail in the hole already made in the center of the bottom of the rough-co\\\\-ered form. Now turn the jar over, letting it rest on the circular piece of wood, as shown in Fig. 7, and you will note that the wood projects from 3/16 -to J\\'4 of an inch all around the rough coat. The finish coat must be built out as far as this. Before going further drive a nail or tack lightly into the wood through the hole which was made in the bottom of the jar near its circumference, as indicated at u, Fig. 7. This ^-s\\'ill hold the jar to the circular wood form, so that it will turn «ith it. As shown in the illustration, the head of the nail in the center of the circular piece of wood -should project beyond the bottom, and a niche should be cut in the working board for it to fit in. The head of the nail will then act as an axis around which the wood and jar can be re\\\\-ol\\\\-ed. -The next step is to make a template or forming strip for the outside of the jar. In this case the jar has perfectly straight sides, therefore all that is necessary is a straight piece of wood. It should be made one inch or more longer than the -distance from the working board to the top of the finished jar, and should be mounted on a frame, as shown in the illustration, Fig. 8, so that it will be perpendicular at all times. The cutting edge of the forming strip should be beveled oft as sho^^•n. After making this, all of the tools necessary for the forming of the jar are complete, and the putting on of the finishing coat can be commenced. -scratch with a sharp tool, such as the teeth of a saw blade, the rough-coated jar, and then thoroughly ^\\\\■ash off M\\'ith a brush and water any h)ose particles of ccnient that may be present. Then, as M-as done in placing the rcnighing coat, take as much of the already prepared finishing coat as can be held on the end of a knife blade, and commencing at the bottom of the jar build out to the edge of the circular piece of wood \\\\\\\\\\'hic!i acts as a guide for the forming template. -Co^-er the \\\\\\\\-hole surface with the finishing coat, graduall)\\' building It out to the i-equired thickness. Xo\\\\\\\\hold the template Hrmly against the circular guide, and at the same time re\\\\-ol\\\\\"e the jar. By so doing, all surplus cement will be cut or scraped oft h\\\\ the edge of the upright template, thus gl\\\\ Ing a perfectly smooth and true surface to the jar. After this operation It ^^■\\\\]\\\\ be found that the top of the sides of the jar are left In rather a crude, rough state. To even these up and to obtain uniform height, nail a piece of «-ood, as Indicated by the dotted lines at (/ In Fig. S, to the upright template, and at the proper cle^■ation to scrape the top of the sitlcs to the desired le\\\\el. -Again place the template in position against the edge of the circular ^\\\\■ood guide at the bottom of the jar, and start re\\\\-ol\\\\-ing the piece. The projecting piece of «ood a, which has been attached to the upright template, will strike the high spots anti cut them off. Thin dn\\\\\\\\-n u\\'lth \\\\\\\\ater the -mortar used for the finishing coat until it is a Httle more of a paste than was used for the sides, and fill in the low spots on top of the jar. Keep revolving the jar and adding mortar until a perfectly smooth, e\\\\\\'cn surface is obtained. -be scratched and A\\\\\\'ashed as was the outside surface before starting to ]a\\\\on the finisli coat. ILning the outside surface as a guide, it is an eas\\\\matter to true up the inside without any further tools than a thin straight edge or a long table knife. But if one feels that he cannot make a true enough surface, another strip of wood, as shown at b. Fig. 8, can be attached to piece u, -which has already been secured to the upright template, in which case the distance c should be the same as the desired thickness of the finished walls of the jar, and the distance d should be the same as the desired inside depth. Then by placing the template or forming tool as shown in Fig. lO ancl re\\\\\\'olving the iar, a true surface will be obtained. It will be found that the lower end of the strip h while re\\\\\\'ol\\\\\\'ing v.\\\\ the jar has formed -a ring at the bottom of the jar, from the surplus cement mortar which has fallen from the sides. This ring acts as an excellent guide for truing up the inner surface of the bottom. If there is not enough surplus cement iii the bottom of the jar to true up the center portion of it, add a little more and tamp or tap it down until it appears about e\\\\-en with the ring around the sides. Then -take a piece of wood with a straight edge and a trifle smaller than the inside of the jar. Let this rest on the ring at the bottom, as indicated in Fig. II. Hold the template stationary, and re\\\\\\'olve the jar. With a little coaxing and by tilling up the low spots as they appear, with a thin mortar, a perfectly smooth surface will be obtained. Having completed the inner face of the bottom, -turn the jar over and let it rest on its top. Remo\\\\-e the round wood guide which is secured to the bottom by nails, and then scratch the cement surface which is now exposed and wet It down. Now add or lay on the finishing coat, and true it off by means of the same template and former as was used for finishing the top edge, only adjust the strip 11 so that it will allow of the desired thickness of finish to be given to the bottom of the jar. -Now, as far as the iinish and form of the jar are concerned, it is complete. Having gone through the operations necessary for the completion of a round jar, it will be easy to build up a square or oblong piece, as the operation is practically the same, the only difference being in the forming and finishing. Here instead of using a round wood guide or form and re\\\\-oh-ing the piece, a square or oblong guicfe, as the case may be, is usetl and the template or former is held against it and mo^-ed along, thus cutting off the surplus cement mortar antl gi\\\\\\'ing a smooth surface to the sules. -7 he last two chapters described the method oF making mdi\\\\\\'idual pieces by means of modeHng or building up on wire frames. 1 his is perhaps the quickest and easiest \\\\vay when there are but icw pieces of a kind to be made; but wlien a inimbcr of duplicate pieces or one design are rci|uired, it IS too slow a method to be useil lor Ciunmcrcial purposes. therefore, \\\\\\\\iien a number of liuplicate pieces are wanted, it is best t(i make up a regLilar mold Into wiiich the concrete oi\\' l\\'i)rtland cement mortar is poured m a liquid nr almost liquid state. I hesc molds are usuall\\\\ made of plaster of Paris. The method of making them or course tliffers according to tlic design ol tlie piece to be cast, but \\\\\\\\hen one has mastered t!ic method of making one or two designs, it is eas\\\\\\' to make others, for the reason that the general principles are the same throughout. -In all mold work the first thing requireil is a pattern or model of the piece ^\\\\•hich is to be produced. If the design is an original one, having relief \\\\\\'\\\\-ork, and is to be reproduced from a dra-vving, the first thing to be done is to model it in clav, and from this clay model the phrster mold is cast. -the model can be made of wood or any other material. In many instances, it is desired to reprntliice articles of a more or less ornate design, ^\\\\hich one has already in hand or which one can procure, such as metal or china ornaments, vases, jardinieres, etc. In this case, the mold can be -A plaster mold of a simple piece, such as a square pot, can be made according to the following directions: The model for this can be made of wood. The dimensions indicated in Fig. 12 are used merely as an example; any other dimensions can be used, as the piece can be made as large or as small as desired, or it may he made oblong. When the «-ood model is put together, it should be \\\\^\\'ell shellacked and oiled. Use fairly hea\\\\y oil or \\\\\\'asellne. This is done to pre\\\\\\'-ent the plaster from sticking. Now place the model on the working board, which should also be oiled, and -strips of wood shaped as indicated at C, and lightly tack these in position on the corners in place of the clay. Shellac and oil the faces ot these strips. The bf)\\\\is now ready to receive the -plaster, which should be mixed as follows: Enam\\' cled tin or Iron ware makes the best thing to mix plaster In, as it is easily cleaned. Place a handful of plaster in voiir tin, and add plenty of water to -it; mix it up until it is of the consistency of a thin paste. Dip your hand into this and scoop the plaster up and throw it on the sides of the model. Cover the sides completely, and keep adding plaster until the sides of the model are co\\\\\\'ered with at least \\'4 inch of plaster; if thicker, no harm will be done. This operation will ha\\\\\"e to be done quickly, for if not the plaster will set o\\'\" become hard in the tin before you can use all ot it. When it has once set before it is used, it has to be thrown f)ut and another mix made. -The piece will now appear as indicated in the plan A\\'iew, Fig. 14. Let the plaster ^^hich has been deposited on the sides i and 2 set for about im or ] i; minutes, and then i-em()\\\\-e the strips ./ and B. Cut holes about \\' 1 of an inch ilceji into the plaster on the surfaces formetl b\\\\\\' the strips ,/ and B. These are called joggle holes, and are pro\\\\-ided so that the plaster mold when Imisheil will tit together properly. Shellac and oil the faces of the plaster as weW as the sides 3 and 4 of the \\\\\\\\\\'()Oil model, and proceed to deposit the plaster on these as was done on the sides i and 2. Care must be taken in all of the above operations not to mo\\\\-e the model from its original position on the working board. The model and plaster sides should now look as shown in Fig. 15. Before remo\\\\\\'ing the plaster sides le\\\\el them off to the height of the model. Xow lift the whole up from the working board. If care has been taken in oiling all sides of the model, a slight jar will -loosen the plaster from it. Then pull apart, as indicated by the arrows, the two plaster sides of the mold. -Lay these aside, and then proceed to make the core or the part of the mold which forms the hole or the inner sides of the box. This is made as -follows : It will be noticed that in the wooci model of the box, which is shown in Fig. 12, a slight taper is given to the inside. I\\'his taper is pro\\\\\\'ided so that the core will draw out more freely than if the sides were perfectly straight. Place your model on the working board. Shellac and grease well the inside of the box, and then mix -the plaster as before, and pour it into the inside of the box. Level the top, and let the plaster set for 10 or 15 minutes. Now turn the box upside down and tap it gently. This will loosen the plaster core, and it will fall out. If the core should for any reason stick to the sides, the wood model should be opened a little, so that the core -can be taken out without injuring it. The core will then be in one piece, as indicated in Fig. 17. It should now be smoothed up nicely, and all corners and edges should be made round. Where a marked taper has been given to the core, it might be, if well oiled, used solid in the mold when casting the cement. -kno\\\\vn as a piece core, as this can be rem()\\\\\\'ed more readily, and Is less liable to break the cement on remoA\\'ing than is the solid core. To make a piece core, cut the solul core shown in -saw. If the saw binds or sticks, a little water applied to the blade \\\\^-ill obviate the trouble. Mark the pieces thus cut i, 2, 3, 4, as indicated, -care being taken to get the proper numbers on the right pieces, as this is the rotation in which they are to be removed from the cast. Piece number I, which is a decided wedge in shape, should be taken out first, and it is well to pro\\\\ide in the top of this piece, as well as in the other pieces, a straight round hole in which a screw eye of suitable size can be screwed. By passing a piece of wood through the eye of the screw, the piece can be easily pulled out from the mold. -After ha\\\\-ing cut the core and fitted it together nicely, as shown in Fig. 17, put it back into the A^\\'ood model. If necessary, tie a string around the pieces to hold tiiem in place. Also before putting the core into the mocfel, place in the bottom of the model a thin strip of wood; about \\'s of an inch thick will be thick enough. 1 his will allow the core to project \\'s of an inch abo\\\\e the sides of the model, as shown in Fig. iS. Taper this \\'sinch projection of the core as sho\\\\Mi, and then place in position, on the outsitle of the model, the outside plaster molds which ha^-e already been made. Tie a string around these to hold them firmly In position. -Now secure bv means of brads, or fresh plaster, strips of \\' 2-Inch ^-ood around the outside mold, as indicated, about \\'4 of an inch from the top. Taper the edges of the plaster mold from the point where the wood is attached to the top as indicated. This can readily be done by cutting the plaster y\\\\-\\\\t\\\\\\\\ a knife. -Joggles or holes should be made in the top of the outside plaster mold, as well as in the top of the pieces of the core as indicated. These will help greatly in holding together as well as in assembling the various pieces of the mold. Now secure to the strips by means of tacks a ^-^-inch -Strip of heavy cardboard around the entire outside mold. Shellac and oil well the entire inside of the inclosure thus made. Now mix your plaster as before, and pour it over the top of the core, the model, ancl the top of the outside plaster mold. The cardboard sides and wood strips already attached will pre\\\\-ent the plaster from running down the sides. Smooth the plaster off le\\\\el with the top of the cardboard, and let it set or -harden. When hard turn the whole upside down, and by gently jarring, the piece just cast will come off freely. This piece is called the case. It will have the form shown in section in Fig. 18, and is used as shown in Fig. 19, for setting up -the core and outside plaster mold in A\\\\hich to cast the cement box. In fact, it forms part of the mold. -Before casting the cement box it will be well again to shellac and oil all parts of the plaster mold which will come in contact with the cement. -I hen set up the mold as shown in Vig. 19, care being taken to bind the outside form firmly toijetlier by means of string. I\\'he mold is now read)\\' to recei\\\\e the cement mixture, which should be made as follows: Take i part of Portland cement and 2 parts of marble dust, il a fairlv light coloi\" is desired; if not, 2 parts of any good clean fine sand will do. INJix these thoroughly together while dry, and then add enough water to allow the whole to be mixed to the consistency ol a hea\\\\\\'y cream. Let it be thin enough so that It will pour freeh\\'. Pour this mixture in the openings a, b, < , d, between the outer plaster mold and the core, until the mixture is flush with the bottom of the core. Lift the mold and gently jar it. This \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ tend to settle the cement, and ^yill also force out any air that may be in the mold, and thus a\\\\\"oid the trouble of air bubbles or \\\\oIds in the finished cast. Ihe cement already deposited in the sides will settle, more or less, under this treatment. Now fill the remaining portion of the m()ld flusli \\\\\\\\ith the top of the outside plaster sides and jar the mold again. Ixepeat this o]ieration until the cement v>\\\\\\\\\\\\ settle no more. Wipe oft the top of the mold with a straight edge, tlius remo\\\\ing any surplus cement, and giving to tiie bottom of the box a good e\\\\-en surface. Then place the mold in a level position, and allow it to stay there \\\\\\'\\\\\\'ithout moving for from 24 hours to 48 hours, the longer the better, as the longer it is allowed to remain, the hardier the cement -will set. After having set for the above-mentioned time, the piece can be removed from the mold. The method of doing this is as follows: Turn the mold over into the position shown in -Fig. 18; tap the case A around its edges; this will loosen the case, M\\'hich is then removed. Now take the screw eye and insert It in the hole in the piece I of the core. Pull this out, and then repeat the operation in pieces 2, 3, and 4 of the core. -Cut the string which binds the sides together, and then pull them off in the direction indicated by the arrows in Fig. 15. -If care has been taken throughout all of the abo\\\\-e operations, the result will be a perfect cast. The next step is the curing of the box. This is a simple operation. All that is necessary is to soak it well with water. This can be done by placing the cast directly in water, and letting it stay there for one or two days, or it can be sprinkled or dashed with water three or four times a day for two or three days in succession or longer; the longer the process is kept up, the better the result. By the application of plenty of water, the product produced will become as harci or harder than stone. -The method of making plaster molds for circular objects is somewhat similar to that described for making square or oblong molds in the last chapter. Instead of making the outer mold in two pieces, however, as described for square work, it is always better to make three pieces, as illustrated in Fig. 2 1, for the reason that in making three pieces the liability of ha\\\\\\'ing an undercut or o\\\\ cr-hang on one of the hal\\\\ es of tiie mold is entirely obviated. ^Vhen two pieces onh\\' are made, unless the mold is cut or parted exactly in the middle there will be an undercut on one piece of the mold, which would pre\\\\-ent the mold from Ireelng itself from the finished cast. By referring to the dotted lines in Fig. 21, the meaning of an undercut will be made clear. The distance u is less -than distance b, and so the part c cannot be removed. The method of maknig this outer mold is the same as was used for making the outer mold for the square form, excepting that as above stated there are three pieces instead of two to be made. -\\\\\\'arious steps in the construction of the outer mold are clearly shown in Fig. 22. Shellac and oil the edges of each section before casting the next. The sides of the concrete or cement cast, if the object is of any size at all, should be at least one-half inch thick, and therefore the core, which is to be composed of four pieces, as shoA^n in Fig. 23 at ./, B, C, D, should always be at least one inch -the core is to secure a box and tit it up as indicated in Fig. 21;. Ihe tapered center of the core D, shown in Figs. 23 and 26, should be made first. -clieese clcith nr mosquito netting \\\\\\\\-hich has pre\\\\-ioLisly been dipped in a thin \"mixture\" of phister of Paris. After ha\\\\ ing prejiaretl the spindle as -above, a temphitc should be cut from a piece of tin and secured to the box as shown in the phin \\\\ie\\\\v, I-\\'ig. 26. \\'!1ie tin template should be mount-cd on a piece of wood, to give it strength, and the wood in turn should be secured by small nails in posltinn on the box as shown. I\\'his template -should be set the proper distance from the center of the spindle, so that on turning the spindle the center of the core produced will be of the exact size and taper desired, as indicated at D, Fig. 23. -After having secured the template in the proper position mix up some plaster of Paris, as previously explained, and pour or throw it on the partly built-up core, at the same time turning the spindle by means of the handle. The plaster thus added will adhere to and partly harden on the spindle. Keep adding plaster and turning the spindle until the plaster is built out to the template, which will cut or scrape it off and form it into a perfect cone. To smooth the surface of the cone, cut away all of the plaster that has adhered to the top of the template, and \\\\\\\\lth your hand, which has pre\\\\-iously been wet with water, rub the surface of the cone as It is being re\\\\ol\\\\ed. Now remove the template and shellac and oil the cone well with either heavy oil, \\\\-aseline, or lard. -The next step is to turn up or form the outer portion of the core. A template should be made for this and secured to the box, as was done for the center of the core, care being taken to locate it In the proper position from the center of the spindle, so that the diameter of the outside of the core win correspond to the desired diameter of the Inside of the finished piece to be made. -oiled, and keep turning the spindle until the plaster has been built up and scraped off by the template and the desired form produced to the outer sur-pig. 27— A Concrete Vase of Bold Design— Greatest Diameter 37 in. Height 42 in. — Executed by L\\'Ibal & Co. -face of the core. Smooth the surface off, as was done with the inside of the core or cone, and shellac and oil It well. -Now remove the whole from the box by lifting up the tin strips i and 2 in Fig. 25, which hold the spindle in place, and part the inner core D from the outer section of the core by jarring the end of the wooden spindle lightly with a hammer. The next step is to cut the outer sections of the core, which is now in the form of a continuous ring, into three pieces. This can be done with an ordinary wood saw; the thinner the blade of the saw, the better. Use water on the saw blade while cutting, as this will prevent it from binding. Be sure to cut the sections as shown in Fig. 23. The section yj must be wider on the inner circumference than on the outer, as shown. Now assemble the three pieces, into ^\\\\hich the outer section of the cone has been cut, around the Inner section of the core D, so that they are again in the same position as shown in Pig. 23, fastening them firmly together with string as indicated. -Then place the core as assembled in the box again, care being taken to get it Into the same position as before removing from the box, securing it In place by placing the tin strips i and 2 over both ends of the spindle as before. Shellac and oil well the outer portion of the core again and then set in place on the box a tin template mounted on wood and shaped to correspond to the outer section of the finished piece, as Indicated in Fig. 28. -throw on the plaster and turn it up until it is built out to the template and shaped into the desired form. Smooth it off with water, and then shellac -and oil. Remove the v/hole from the turning box, tap the end of the wood spindle, and if care has been taken to shellac and oil all of the parts as directed, the center of the core will fall out. To remove the outer part of the core, first take out the smaller piece yJ by forcing it toward the center. The rest of the core will then collapse, and we will have left a plaster model of the box, as shown in F^ig. 29, which we are to cast in cement. Oil the outside of this well, and then proceed to -After ha\\\\-ing made the outer mold, proceed to assemble the parts as shown in Fig. 31, and cast the plaster case, as was described in the last chapter for square objects. Use a clay belt around the outer mold as shown to prevent the plaster from coming down too far. The spindle must be cut flush with bottom of plaster model. Before casting the case be sure to shellac and oil all parts which come in contact with the wet plaster used in casting the case. After having re-moved the case assemble the parts again, using the case as a base as shown in Fig. 32. Cut the spindle flush with the core. The mold set up in this position is ready to receive the liquid cement mixture, which is poured the same way as already explained in the last chapter. -One need not confine themselves to straightsided objects, as molds, for pieces embodying curved outlines, etc., can also be made by following the general directions gi\\\\\\'en for the molci just described, the only difference being in the shape of -the templates used. It will therefore be unnecessary to go into details as to how to make a mold for vases shaped as shown in Figs. 20, 27, and 33, as the illustrations, which show the various steps, will make it clear to one who has followed the previous directions closely. It will be noticed, however, that there is quite an undercut at the point a in the vase shown in Fig. 22>, owing to -the mouth of the vase being of a smaller diameter than the greatest inside diameter of the piece. The main thing to guard against, therefore, in making the mold for this piece is the core. Care must be taken to ha^•e the distance B shorter than the diameter of the inside core or cone C. If this is not done, it will be impossible to get the core -out of the finished cast. It might be well to state the progressi\\\\-e operations in the making of this mold. They are as follows: First, make inner core or cone. Second, build up outside part oj core. Third, remo\\\\\\'e outside part of cf)re and cut into pieces as shown. Fourth, reassemble core and place in spinning box. Fifth, build up and turn plaster model of piece to be cast. Sixth, rcmo\\\\\\'e all pieces from spinning box and cast outside mold. Seventh, cast case. -There are but few materials that lend themselves to garden ornaments better than concrete, Like stone, it seems to harmonize with the surroundings and gives a dignified and massi\\\\-e appearance to the whole theme, which is most pleasing to the eye. This is particularly true if gooil. -As a usual practice, concrete ornaments are cast in plaster or glue molds. If the piece is at all complicated the making of the mold in which -it is to be cast Is rather an expensi\\\\\\'e operation, especially so when there are but one or two pieces of the same design to be made. -The author has designed and made several \\\\ases shaped as shown In Fig. 34, which have been much admired. The method used In making them Is simple and somewhat novel, Inasmuch as it embraces a combination of casting and model-i]Tg. A description of how these vases are made may be of interest to those readers who are apt at making things and who wish to beautify their ia«ns or gardens at a minimum expense. -By closely following the Instructions gi\\\\-en in the detailed descriptions of the ^\\'arious operations used in the making of the vase Illustrated, the -The first thing to do is to make the outer mold, as shown in Fig. 35. This can be made of heavy cardboard or very thin, pliable wood. In the design shown the greatest diameter is 12 inches, therefore the length of the piece of cardboard to be used for making the outside form must be at least 36 inches long. Make it 38 Inches. This -Avill allow a lap of 2 inches, as shown. The height of the vase is 6jj inches, therefore the piece should be 38 inches long by 6^1 inches high. Form this into a circle and secure the ends b\\\\means of pins or by sewing them together witii string. Now cut out a circular piece of cardboard 12 inches in diameter as shown at A, Fig. 35 ; this is to be secured, by se^^\\'ing, to the bottom of the outside mold, thus forming a circular box 12 inches in tflameter by 6^2 inches high, as shown in the illustration. The next step is to make the -core, or that part of the mold which forms the inside sides of the vase or the hole. By referring to Fig. 36 It will be seen that the core is 6 inches in diameter by 5 inches deep, therefore the piece of cardboard necessary to form the core must be twenty inches long by 5 inches high. This will allow a lap of 2 inches, the same as was gnen to the outside part of the mold. Form a circle of this piece, as shown at />, and secure the ends in lil<e manner as were those of the outsiile mold. -No«\\\\^!th mucilage or glue secure small strips of hea\\\\y paper to the bottom of the outside of the core, as shown. \\\\ hen place the core in the bottom of tlie round box, as indicated in Fig. 35. Locate it ()\\\\ er the 6-inch circle, which has previously been drawn on the inside bottom of the box, as shown at ./, Fig. 35, and secure it in place by gluing do\\\\^n the small pieces of paper which \\\\va\\\\z already been attached to the outside of the core. No\\\\\\\\\\' nil the inside of the core \\\\^-ith dry earth, or, better still, sand. This is done to pre\\\\-ent the -core from collapsing when the concrete is placed in the mold. Before placing the concrete the outside mold should also be bound around with heavy twine, as shown in Fig. 37, to prevent it from bulging. Now insert in the sand or earth, in the center of the core, a wooden plug about ^\\'4 inch in diameter, as shown at a in Fig. 37. Taper it as shown, and shellac and oil it well so that It will draw out easily from the concrete. Let it project about 2 inches out from the core. This plug will form the drainage-hole in the bottom of the \\\\ase. The mold is now complete, but before Idling it with concrete it should be placed on a workingboard, which should be at least 18 inches square, as shown in Fig. 37. The next step is the preparation of the mixture. In this case, owing to the fact that the piece is to be modeled, no stone should be used. The mixture should be composed of 2 parts of good clean sand, not too coarse, and I part of Portland cement. Mix the sand and cement together thoroughly while dry until a good uniform color is obtained throughout. Now add enough water to this so as to make it of the consistency of putty or fairly stiff dough. Work it up well so as to procure a uniform consistency through the whole mass. Now place this mixture, in its plastic state, in the mold, ramming or tamping it down lightly as you place it in. Fill the mold flush with its sides, and level it off as shown at J in Fig. 37. Do not disturb the mold, which is now filled with the mixture, for at least -two or three hours. After having set for the above length of time the concrete will be hard enough to allow of the removal of the outer mold, and the sharp corners of the concrete, shown at A in Fig. 38, can be roughly cut off by means of a sharp tool such as the edge of a good strong ls;nife or a mason\\'s trowel. The next thing to do is to make a template, or former, with which to model -or shape the vase. This Is done as follows: First procure a piece of fairly heavy sheet tin or zinc and draw on it an exact outline of the bottom half of the finished \\\\ase, as indicated in Fig. 38. Now cut a piece of i-inch thicli wood, as shown, and nail to this the tin template, as indicated. Hold the bottom part of this template firmly to the working-board and against the side of the concrete cast, as shown in Fig. 38, and by gradually working it back and forth around the piece the superfluous cement, which is still in a soft state, -will be cut or scraped off of the cast and a good uniform outline will be produced around Its entire surface. Now remove the plug a by means of gently twisting and pulling. Then place another working-board on top of the cast, as shown in Fig. 39, at A, and then lift the piece up, at the same time firmly holding the two working-boards against it, as shown, and reverse the whole into the position indicated by B in Fig. 39. Remove -the board which is now on top, as wqW as the cardboard disk which formed the bottom of the mold, and proceed to model the upper part of the cast in the same manner as «as explained for modeling or forming the bottom of the piece. A detailed drawing of the template to use in modeling the top is sho\\\\A\\'n at A in Fig. 41. It will be noticed that the distance from the bottom to the top of this template is i inch sliorter than the template used for forming the bottom of the vase. This -portion in Fig. 39 represents the superfluous cement which is to be cut away from the top of the cast before starting to use the template to form -the finished outline of the vase. The square edges which will be left on the ring by the template, as indicated at a in Fig. 41, can be rounded off by hand, with a pointing tool or knife, as shown at b. The body of the \\\\-ase is now complete, and it can be set aside to harden. Do not -attempt to remo\\\\\\'e it from the working-board for at least eight to twelve hours, for, as yet, it is in a soft state and must be handled carefully. -First procure a piece of wood and cut it into a triangle, as shown at A in Fig. 42. Make the two sides marked i and 2, 7 inches long. Now lay out the outline of the handle on this piece of wood, as shown by the unshaded part at B, closely following the dimensions given. The dotted lines -on the two ends of the handle shoM\\' a projection of about vs inch. This length is added to the handle in order to insert it into niches or holes which are later to be cut in the sides of the \\\\\\'ase for this purpose. A piece of wood should now be cut out to conform to the outline of the shaded portion shown in Fig. 42 at B. 1 his should be -made of wood 2 inches thick or should be built up of two i-inch boards, as it forms the inner part of the mold for the handles, which are to be 2 inches wide. Secure this piece, by nails, in position on the triangular piece of wood, as shown at C in Fig. 42, and then nail lightly to the outside of the triangle strips of wood as shown. Be sure to have them lap as indicated. The tops of these strips should also be on a level with the top of the solid block a, or a distance of 2 inches from the inside bottom of the triangular piece, as shown In the cross-section at D in ¥\\\\g. 42. Shellac and oil the inside of the mold well to prevent the concrete from sticking. -Now secure four pieces of steel wire i 8 to 3/16 inch in diameter and from 13 inches to 14 inches long, and bencf them to the shape shown by the hea\\\\\\'y dark line in the plan drawing at B, Fig. 42. Lay these to one side ami then start to fill the box or mold for the handle with a mixture composed of the same ingredients as was used for the body of the vase. Fill the mold first to a depth of jA inch and tamp or press the cement down well, and then lay in, in the position indicated, one of the wires. Now lav In i Inch more of the mixture, and press or tamp it down, and then place in the other wire, and fill the mold flush with the top as shown at D in Fig. 42. Trowel It off smooth and let it set for from eight to twelve hours, so that it will harden up well. Then carefully remove the sides of the mold; first removing -side 3 and then side i. After having removed these two sides the cast of the handle can be easily removeci without fear of breaking it. Clean the mold out well and shellac and oil the insides of it again. Then replace the sides 3 and i and proceed to cast the other handle in the same way. After remo\\\\\\'ing the handles from the mold wet them down occasionally so that they will become good and hard. -The next step is to cut holes into the body of the vase into which to insert and cement the handles. The sand or earth core, as well as the card-board lining, should be remo\\\\\\'eci and a line should be drawn across the top and down both sides of the vase at its center, as shown in Fig. 44. This line will show where the handles are to be located. Hold the handle in its proper position against the side of the vase, and with a pencil outline the position and shape of its two ends on the body of the vase. Now with a hammer and chisel gently cut out holes at these points about \\'j inch deep, into -which to cement the handle. Locate and cut out holes on the opposite side of the \\\\-ase for the other handle to tit into it in like manner. Now by gently tapping with a hammer roughen up the ends of the handles, and then place both the \\\\\\'ase and the handle in water or sprinkle them until they are thoroughly wet. Now mix some pure Portland cement and tt\\'ater together into a t airly thick paste, and trowel it well into the holes prepared for the handle in the body of the vase as well as on to both ends of the handle. Sprinkle both of these surfaces with water and then place the handle in position, firmly pressing it in place. True it up and scrape away the surplus cement, at the same time making a neat hnish around the handle \"where it joins the \\\\-ase. HoKl the handle in position by binding it firmly in place by good stout string. Wedge tlie string up, as Indicated in Fig. 44, to help further tighten it. Wet the joint down well with water occasionally and allow the string to remain in position for at least tuehe hours before remo\\\\-ing it In order to allow the handle to be firmly cemented in place. Secure the other handle to the a ase in like manner, and the vase Is now complete. -If by any chance there should be any holes or marked irregularities in the surface of the \\\\-ase these can be pointed or filled up with a mixture composed of the same ingredients as used In the body of the vase. A good smooth, fairly light finish can be procured by rubbing the whole sur-f:icc down with coarse emery cloth. Then soak the \\\\ase in water and rub o\\\\\\'er its entire surface a thin coat of a mixture composed of i part of marble dust and i part of Portland cement. Let this dry out and then again wet down the vase. The oftener the vase is wet the harder it will be. Remember that water is a most important factor in all concrete work. One can never get a good bond between two surfaces if the parts are not thoroughly wet down. The dimensions given in Fig. 36 are merely suggestive. The same general principle and directions as given above can be used for making a vase of almost any size and shape, as well as for making tables, pedestals, etc. -Glue molds, or flexible molds as thev are often called, are extensively used in casting concrete ornaments in which the design embodies hea\\\\y relief work containing more or less undercut. Owing tn the flexible nature of these molds, thcv can be made in fewer pieces than a plaster mold could be made, for the same class of work, and at the same time they can be more easily removed from the cast, while the concrete is still in a more oi\" less unhardened state, with less fear of injuring the more delicate parts of tlie design. -The only objection to the glue !iiold is that its life is limited to from li\\\\-e to eight casts at the most, whereas the life of a plaster mold is practically unlimited. In making a glue mold, as in all other cast work, the first thing to do is to procure your original or model of the piece which is to be reproduced. First will be explained how to make a simple one-piece form of glue mold, such as is used in casting pieces similar to those illustrated in Figs. 4^, 46 and 47. Take the model of the piece which is to be reproduced, and secure it to the working-board, as shown in the cross-sectional drawing, Fig. 48. A cFiub of shellac on the back of the model in most cases will hold it in place on the working-board. Now dampen an old -newspaper and lay it o\\\\-er the model. Let it follow the general outlines of the model as closely as you can, as shown by the heavy line in Fig. 48. The next step is to procure some modelers\\' clay, and ^^•ith an ordinary rolling pin roll it out into a sheet about ^.2 inch thick. The model is now to -be completely covered with this sheet clay, as shown in Fig. 49, thus producing an even thickness of yi inch of clay all over its entire surface. 7\"he clay thus placed on the model is next to be entirely covered with a plaster of Paris case of about y^ inch to I inch in thickness, according to the size of the piece. -The method of casting a phister of Paris case is explained in detail in the chapter on Plaster Molds. Before casting the case, however, do not neglect to oil the surface of the clay well, so as to prevent it from adhering to the inside of the plas-ter case. iXfter the plaster case has hardened mark its outline on the \"working boanl, and then carefully lift the case and remox\\'e It from the clay coN\\'ering, then in turn remo\\\\-e the clay co\\\\-ering and paper from the model. If any of the paper -should ha\\\\\\'e adhered to the model, clean it off, and then shellac and oil the model well, so as to prevent the glue from sticking to it. -sized hole In it at (/, as indicated in Fig. 51. This hole should be at least \\'4 inch in diameter, as it is to receixe the end of the funnel through which the glue is to be poured. Also make a number -of smaller holes, say ^ inch in diameter, at various points throughout the cast, as indicated by the light double lines. These latter holes are -vent holes, and are provided In the case so as to let the air escape from ^^•ithln while the lii]uid glue is being poured. After ha\\\\\\'ing prepared the cast as directed, rephice it m its original position o\\\\-er the model, as indicated by the outline of it which was made on the working hoard before it was -removed from the clay covering over which it M-as cast. Secure the case Hrmly to the board by means of passing can^•as straps o\\\\\\'er it, as shown in the end view Fig. 52. Now, instead of having -an even thickness of clay over the model, we have a cavity of uniform size around the entire model, into which the glue is to be poured. It is essential that the glue should be of a uniform -thickness over the entire surface of the model, in order to have it flow properly, and also to produce a uniform flexibility throughout the glue mold. The best glue to use in making glue molds is a fine grade of white glue. This can be procured at almost any paint store. If the dealer does not know exactly what you want, ask for the -regular grade of glue of which plasterers make glue molds. Almost any good glue, however, will do; it ranges in price from 18 cents to 25 cents per pound. Sheet gelatine can also be used in -making flexible molds, but it is a trifle more expensive than glue. To prepare the glue, soak it in water from ten to fifteen minutes, in which time -EncJ ^leuf of txtie s/wwin^ ca/ti/as st^^ips fop holdina coie c^ufn \\' t^\\'hUe ^fiie is ietJzg poupcd -it will absorb the water and swell up. Now take a regular double tin; cover the bottom of the inner tin with water, and then place in it the glue prepared as directed above. If a double tin is -not a\\\\-ailable, two tin pails can be used, as shown in Figs. 55 and 56. One of these should be placed inside of the other as shown, and the bottom of -the inner pail should be kept about 2 inches from the bottom of the outer pail by letting it rest on a block of wood or a piece of brick. When -melting the glue do not have too hot a fire, but let the glue melt slowly until it Is of the consistency of thin molasses. When it is of the proper consistency pour it into the funnel, which has previously been secured in place in the plaster -case, as indicated in Fig. 51. Now as the mold fills up, the glue will run out of the \\\\\\'ent holes, which are shown by the heavy dotted lines, thus indicating that the glue is flowing properly. As the glue appears at these holes, stop them up ^^ith a daub of modeler\\'s clay. Keep on pouring the -glue until it runs out of the highest vent hole and until the funnel remains full. The glue thus poured will take about twelve hours to congeal -or harden, after which time the plaster case or mask, as it is sometimes called, can be lifted off. This is done by first cutting the glue away from the funnel, and then removing the canvas straps -which lield the case down on the working board and prevented it from rising as the glue was poured. Now in turn remove the glue mold from the model. This can be easily done, if the model -has been properly oiled, by simply springing out the sides of the glue cast, and lifting it up from the face of the model. -waterproof as one can. A common method of doing this is to paint the surface of the mold with a saturated solution of alum. About three coats of this solution are necessary, letting each coat dry out well before applying the next. A simpler and probably more effecti\\\\\\'e method is to coat the face of the glue mold with one or two coats of a fine grade of good clear flexible varnish. Before making a cast, always oil the inner face of the mold well with a light oil. To assemble the mold -for a cast, place the mask or case on the working board, as shown in Fig. 60. Then drop in the glue mold, which will find its place in the case readily, and then proceed to pour in the cement mixture. The mixture to use for this class of work should be composed of i part Portland cement to 2 or 3 parts of sand. Enough water should be added to make it of a creamy consistency or thin enough to pour. Fill the mold with this mixture flush with the top, and then jar the mold up and down two or *:hree times to force -out any air that may have gotten in with the mixture while pouring. If this is not done, air bubbles or voids may appear in the face of the finished cast. Allow this mixture to harden for at least twelve hours after being poured. To remove the cast, turn the case o\\\\er, and the glue mold will come away from it; then by gently taking hold of the glue mold and bending it up, the cement cast will readily be released. -In making a glue mold for a piece having relief work on all four sides, or all around its surface, as in circular pieces, such as the table leg, the plaster model of which is shown in Fig. 61, a different method of procedure must be employed than that which has just been explained. The first thing to do is to place the model on the working board, as shown in Fig. 62. Now draw a line along the opposite sides of the model at its widest part, and build up to this line, from the -working board, with modelers\\' clay. Sometimes in order to save clay and time, boards are placed along the sides of the model so as to come almost -to a level with the line drawn on the model, and then the clay is built up from these boards to a line corresponding to the line on the model, as -After having built up the clay around the model as shown, a damp newspaper should be placed ovev it, and in turn this should be covered with a \\'j-inch layer oi clay, as pre\\\\\\'iously explained and as shown in Fig. 63. A plaster case should then be cast o\\\\\\'er this clay in a similar manner, as explained before and as shown in Pig. 64. After -this case has hardened, the clay and boards, which were used for forming the parting line, should be remo\\\\ed and the whole piece, including the plaster case, the clay covering over the model, and the model itself, should be turned over on the working board into the position shown in Fig. 6\\'^. Now the upper part or half of the model, which is still exposed, is to be treated in like manner. Before casting the upper plaster cast, howe\\\\cr, it -would be well to shellac and oil the exposed edges of the lower plaster case, so as to pre\\\\-ent the upper half of the case sticking to it. After ha\\\\ ing cast the upper plaster case on the model, it will appear as shown in Mg. 66. -plaster base or bottom should be cast on it. I he inner sides of this bottom piece should be tapered and should extend up around the outer sides of the case for at least from 2 to 3 inches, as shown in Fig. 67. The method used for casting a plaster base or bottom of this kind for a mold is clearly explained in the chapter on \"Plaster Molds.\" After having cast this bottom piece, the whole should be disassembled, and the plaster case, -which was cast around the model, should be taken off, and the clay and paper in turn should be removed from the model. The model should -then be thoroughly cleaned up and oiled. The plaster case should then be assembled around it. as shown in Fig. 67, and firmly held together by means of hooks or bands. The glue should then -be poured into the ca\\\\\"it}\\' between the phister case and the mold, as sho\\\\i-n in the illustration. After having poured the glue, let the whole stand, without disturbing it in any way, for at least twehe hours, in ^^\\'hich time the glue will have hardened sufficiently to allow of the two halves of the plaster case to be removed. 1 hese should come a^-ay readily from the glue if they have been well oiled before the glue was poured. On the outer part of the glue mold there will appear a line or a slightly elevated ridge of glue. 1 his will indicate the location of the joining of the two hah\\'es of the plaster case. I\\'he glue mold must be cut along these lines, so as to form two halves of it. This cutting can be readily accomplisheel by using a good, strong, sharp knife. Do not hack it or roughen the edges of the glue any more than can be helped. The glue mold when cut in halves should appear as shown in Fig. 68. In the illustration one of the hahes of the glue mold is shown in place in the plaster case, and the other is shown resting on the other half of the case. By the way it bends under its own weight, one can readily see ho^flexible It is. j\\\\fter ha\\\\-ing been cut in half, the inner surfaces of the glu mold should be treated with a saturated solution of alum, or it should be varnished, as pre\\\\\\'iousl\\\\\\' explained. If the mold is to be varnished, it should be allo\\\\\\\\\\'etl to dry out for twenty-foiu\" hours after it has been removed from the model before the first coat is applied. It should then be -well oiled before a cast is made in it. In assembling the mold for a cast, the two halves of the glue mold should be placed in their respective plaster cases. These in turn should then be -brought together and placed in the bottom part of the mold, then they should be firmly secured together by means of bands or hooks, as was done when casting the glue mold and as illustrated in Fig. 67. -The pouring of the cement mixture, the removing of the mold, and the curing of the finished cast is done in a similar manner as when casting -in any other form of mold. In Fig. 69 is illustrated a table, the legs of which are of concrete casts made in the glue mold just described. The same principles of procedure as explained above are used in making glue molds for round or square vases. The only additional part required for vase work is the core. These can be made of -plaster as described In a pre\\\\ idus chapter, or the\\\\\\' can be made of glue with an inner core of wood, as illustrated in Fig. 71. In this case the outer part of the inner -wood core should be well oiled, so that it can be withdrawn from the glue shell. The glue shell of the core, which will then remain in place in the cast, can then, due to its flexible nature, be collapsed and withdrawn from the inner part of the cast. When casting vases, always cast them with the bottom up, as explained in Chapters III and W . -not be thrown away, for the ghie in It is still good to use. It should be cut up into small pieces and allowed to dry out. It can then be melted over again and used for making other glue molds. A rack containing pieces of old glue molds cu.t up, ready for use, is shown in Fig. ^5, just above the glue pots and sto\\\\\"e. -After ha\\\\ing mastered the process of modeling and casting, as explained in the pre\\\\ious chapters, the craftsman can now take up the decorati\\\\\"e features. The possibiUties of ornamentation, one can say, are ahnost unhmited with this material. Various effects can be obtained. One can repro-duce antiques which can hardly be told from the originals, and original designs embodying various colors can be made which will compare favorably -with modern clay pottery effects. Owing to the material used the texture obtained is one which is full of life and sparkle. It has a distinct characteristic of its own which cannot be obtained in any other material. -As a specific case of what can be done along these lines we will take the copy of an antique which is illustrated in Fig. 72. This was made as follows: It was first cast with perfectly smooth sides, a mixture of i part Portland cement to 2 parts of fairly coarse brown sand being used. After pouring this mixture it was allowed to set in the mold for from eight to twelve hours. The mold was then remo\\\\\\'ed and the piece was found to be in a more or less soft state. That is, it had to be handled carefully, and the concrete had not become so hard that an impression could not be made in it with the sharp point of a knife; the design as shown ^^•as then marked on the surface, and in turn it was cut and dug out by a strong knife blade. A straightedge was placed along the ^•arious lines, being used as a guide for the blade. The depth to which the design should be cut \\\\aries according to the size of the piece; but in small work usually from J ,s of an inch to 3 \\'16 of an inch will gi\\\\e the most effccti\\\\\\'c results. If for any reason one cannot commence the work of cutting out the design within twehe hours after the piece has been cast, or until the piece has become quite hard, it -will then be necessary to use a small hammer antl chisel with which to cut -out the design. Care should be taken, however, in using these tools not to strike too hard a blow, for if one hits too hard the piece may break, although in antique work if the edges of the cutout design are more or less irregular it makes the piece so much more effective. -Avhich has been modeled and built up on wire forms as explained in Chapters I. and II., such as a vase or other piece, as illustrated in Fig. 73, the design must be cut out previous to the inlaying of the colors exactly as has been just described for antique relief work. -in a mold as described in Chapters III. and IV., the mold can be prepared to form the desired depression, in which case the d^isign will be cast in the piece. For complicated designs of this character a clay model must be provided from which the plaster mold is made. But in simple designs such as illustrated the piece which is to form the recess can be attached to the inside of the outside mold as shown in Pig. 71;. l^his can be made of wood and can be secured in place by -brads. It should be located in the proper position and should be of the exact size and shape of the outline of the design and at least \\' s of an inch thick. Shellac and oil the piece well before -pouring the cement and allow a good bevel or draft on all of the edges so that it will draw out easily from the cast and thus leave a good, clean, sharp edge to the ca\\\\-ity into \\\\\\\\hich to lay the colored cements. -of late these attempts have been most unsatisfactory. This was largely due to the fact that ordinary Portland cement is of a gray color and on mixing it with the various color pigments the result was a decidedly dirty or dead tint of the color used, similar to that which would be produced in water colors by mixing them with water which had already been discolored by India ink -or lampblack. Another cause of unsatisfactory results along these lines was the fact that many of those who experimented did not use the proper color pigments, the result being that the colors faded out on exposure to the weather. The first cause of not being able to produce true tints can now be overcome by the fact that a really true tthite Portland cement is being manufactured. Ihis now can be procured from almost any cement dealer. By using this as a base with which to mix the pigments, true, clear colors can be obtained, and by the use of nothing but good mineral pigments, known as lime or cement-proof colors, it is possible to produce shades which will be absolutely permanent. -The writer has experimented largely with coloring matters from this country as well as from abroad. Many of the coloring matters obtained from abroad are very good, but their cost is naturally higher than those which are made in this country. -As before stated, mineral colors are those which give the best and most permanent results. They all come in powdered form and should be mixed with the dry cement and marble dust or white sand, as the case may be, until the whole mass is of a uniform tint throughout. After having mixed them as above, water should be added and the whole mixed into a mortar. -1 he amount of coloring matter to use in proportion to the cement depends entirely upon the depth or shade of the color desired. By mixing up small specimens of the color with \\\\-arious proportions of cement and making small test pieces of mortar and then noting the color of these after they ha\\\\-e dried out, one can readily determine the proper amount of coloring matter to use. It is always better to weigh the amount of pigment used rather than to judge the amount by bulk, for by weighing a much more uniform result can be obtained. -VoY ornamental \\\\york where a wide range of colors is desired they can be procured by the same means as is used in water or oil color painting; that is, by mixing together the three primary colcjrs, which are red, yellow, and blue. From these three colors can be obtained every color or tone that may be required. Thus blue mixed «\\'ith yellow produces green; blue mixed with red produces \\\\ iolet, and red mixeci with yellow produces orange, etc. In combining the coloring matters, always do so while they are in a dry state and thoroughly mix or grind them together before adding them to the white cement. -Ihe method of laying these coloreci cement mortars in the design is as follows: First, enough water must be added to the dry mass to allow it to be mixed to the consistency of a thin paste. J hen the design, which has already been cut out as previously explained, should be thoroughly wet doAvn by sprinkling with a wet brush. -If a \\\\\\'aricolored design is to be inlaid, it is always well to lay in all of one color at the same time, as is illustrated in Fig. 75. In this case we have figures A, B and C which are to contain the colors red, blue, and black, as indicated. First, ^^•ith the aid of a blade of a penknife or any other handy tool according to the size of the work, lay the red cement in the design A as shown at D by the dotted lines. Let it come level with or even a trifle higher than the face or body of the ^\\'asc or piece which is being inlaid; also let the colored -cement project beyond Its position in tlie finished design as indicated by the dotted lines. Now turn the vase around, and lay the red cement in the designs B and C, letting it project beyond its position as was done in the design J. The red cement which has been laid in the design J will now be set enough so that a straightedge made of a -flexible piece of wood, or other material such as cardboard, can be placed over it in the position of the finished design as indicated at D by the dotted lines. -The sharp edge of a knife can now be used to cut away the surplus cement which projects beyond the edge of the straightedge. In cutting away the surplus cement always cut away from the -finished design. Proceed to cut away all other surplus cement from the other three sides of the design as just described and then in turji treat the designs B and C in the same manner. Now lay in the blue cement in all of the designs In a similar manner and then the black cement. If by chance any of the colored cements have gone beyond the designs and onto the face of the vase, scrape them -off before they harden and then with the back, of the blade of the knife, which is more or less blunt, run around the outline of the designs as well as between the colors, using a straight edge as a guide. By doing this a distinct parting line is produced between each color and a better effect can be obtained. -The colored cements which have just been inlaid must, of course, be cured so as to harden them up. This is done by sprinkling them with water as explained in previous chapters. -In the previous chapters nothing much has been said in detail in regard to the numerous and various materials which can be used with which to make concrete, such as the different Icinds of stones, pebbles, etc. Nor has anything been said in regard to the quantity of each ingredient necessary to make a fixed amount of finished material. -Concrete is made by mixing together with water various proportions of Portland cement, sand, and stone. The sand and stone which go to make part of the mixture are commonly known as aggregates. It is by the careful selection of these aggregates that we are able to produce numerous pleasing and artistic results. -In many cases, if the proper aggregates are used in the right proportion, natural stones such as limestone, granite of all colors, brownstone, and French Caen stone, etc., can be so closely simulated that it takes an expert to tell it from the real material. -The ordinary concrete or cement surface as usually seen is most uninteresting in appearance. As a general thing, it is smooth and lifeless and of a dull gray color. The same general appearance as just described for ordinary concrete will -prevail In almost any concrete surface, no matter ^^\\'hat the aggregate used, unless the surface is treateci so as to expose or bring out the aggregates used. If, however, the surfaces of the concrete in which selected aggregates have been used are properly treated, a marked difference between these surfaces and those obtained with -ordinary mixtures wdl be noted. By varying the kind, size, and proportions of the aggregate used, sin-face Hnishes of practically any desired color and textin-e can be f)btained, the possibilities being limited only by the number of different kinds of aggregates available and the combinations of the same. -In small work, that is, where the thickness of the finished product is to be }4 inch or less, never use any aggregate exceeding j/g inch in size, especially so if the mixture is to be made thin enough to pour. In larger work having a thickness of i inch or more, aggregates up to j^ of an inch can be used with good results. -A mixture composed of i part ^^hite marble chips, not exceeding J4 inch in size, and i part of trap rock or other dark stone of the same size mixed with i part of Portland cement and i part of marble dust will produce a surface similar in appearance to a light granite. This mixture should be allowed to set for twelve hours after pouring, then the molds should be carefully remo\\\\-ed, as the concrete is still green, and the surface of the concrete should be lightly brushed with a stiff brush. -As the concrete is not thoroughly set or hardened yet, this operation will remo\\\\e the surface cement, and thus expose the aggregates of marble an.d trap rock. After ha\\\\-ing performed the above operation, allow the piece to harden a few days, and then treat the surface with a solution composed of i part of commercial muriatic or hydrochloric acid to 3 parts of water. Dash this solution onto the face of the concrete surface with a brush, and allow it to remain for at least fifteen minutes. Then thoroughly scrub it off with a -good stiff brush and plenty of clean water. This operation will remove all of the surplus cement, and will leave a good clean surface full of life and sparkle. Instead of using white marble chips -and granite, as above, one can vary the results by using white marble chips and crushed-up red brick; or various colored marbles crushed to the proper size can be used, and then by treating the surfaces as explained, the colors in the various -A good light-colored surface somewhat simulating limestone can be procured by using i part Portland cement to 2 or 3 parts of white marble dust. After this has become thoroughly hard, treat it with acid as described above. The acid will eat off any surface cement, and thus the marble dust will be exposed, producing a pleasing sparkle throughout the entire surface. To simulate white marble, use i part white Portland cement to 2 parts of marble dust, and treat surface with acid as described. -By incorporating in the above mixture a small amount of yellow ocher a pleasing buff tint \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ be given to the mass, which will then \\\\ery closely resemble French Caen stone. To simulate red granite, use red granite chips or screenings. These can be procured at almost any stone yard where they cut granite. The pieces to use should range in size from J 4 inch down to dust. If the pieces available are too large, they can be crushed up with a hammer. The proportions of the mixture should be i part of Portland cement to 2 parts of the granite. After having set for twelve hours, brush the surface out and treat it with acid as already explained, and the surface thus obtained will very closely resemble the real red granite. From the above details the reader will have grasped the possibilities to be obtained by the selection of aggregates, and now by using a -little ingenuity can without further instruction experiment along original Hues, which will be found most fascinating work. -In regard to the amount of the various ingredients to use for a fixed amount of finished material, the uninitiated often think, and naturally so, that -Fif;. 80— Large Flower Box, finished with Antique Stone EffectSize of Box 24 in. hif;li hy 25 in. wide by 41 in. long, Legs 15 in.

This is not so. The particles of cement are ground so fine that the cement is practically one dense mass; but the particles of sand are coarser, and between each of the particles appears a space or cavity. These cavities are called \\\\-oids, ai:d it is in these voids that the larger portion of the cement finds its place when the mass is mixed. As the majority of sands used in concrete work contain from 25 per cent to 40 per cent of \\\\-oids (we will take the larger figure for an example), it is plain then that each glass of sand contains about 40 per cent of voids. Therefore in two glassfuls of sand we will have 80 per cent of one glassful of ^•oids. As we only ha\\\\-e one glassful of cement to add to the two glassfuls of sand, and as the cement fills the 80 per cent of \\\\-oids in the sand, it is plain that we have but 20 per cent left upon which we can figure for bulk. Therefore, instead of having three glassfuls of material, as one might naturally think, we will only have two glassfuls and 20 per cent of one glassful over, or two and one-fifth glassfuls of finished material. The percentage of voids varies largely in different grades of sands. The finer the particles of which the sand is made up, the smaller the percentage of -voids. It Is always best to use sand in which the particles are not uniform in size, or in other words, use what is commonly termed a wellgraded sand. By this is meant a sand in which the -Fis81 — Concrete Flower Box made with Selected AgSfrcKUtes and Inlaid with Tile— Executed by Albert Moyer -particles vary in size say from 1/32 inch or smaller up to 1/16 inch or a trifle larger. The heavier the work, the coarser the sand that can be used. Be sure that the sand used is clean. By clean sand is meant sand that is free from loam or clay. One can readily detect dirty sand by -placing same in the palm of the hand and slightly wetting it. Then if by rubbing it around the hand becomes discolored, there is more or less dirt in the sand. A little dirt will not do much harm, but it is always well to have it per-Fig. 81a — Concrete Flower Box made with Selected Aggregates and Inlaid with Tile — Executed by Albert Moyer -fectly clean. It is often found necessary to wash the dirt out of sand by means of water. This can be done by placing the sand in a pail of water and agitating it, thus making the dirt rise to the top. To thoroughly wash the sand, keep -running the water into the pail and agitating the sand until the water discharged is practically clear. -When using a stone aggregate in the mixture, the spaces or voids between the particles of stone are filled by the cement and sand in the mixture, as were the voids In the sand filled by the cement. As in sand, the larger the particles of stone used, the greater the percentage of voids in it will be. Therefore a greater amount of sand and cement will be required to fill them. -By a little experimenting along these lines, one will become experienced enough to judge fairly closely the amount of each ingredient to use in mixing up any amount of finished material needed. It is always well to mix a trifle more material than is needed rather than not enough. For when one once starts pouring a cast, they should continue to pour until the mold is full. If not, a mark is \\\\-ery apt to show in the finished cast where pouring was left off and started again. Never try to use any material that has been mixed and let stand for more than half an hour. For in this time the concrete will have commenced to get what is called its initial set. If the mass is now disturbed and worked up again, the product produced A\\\\ill ne\\\\\\'er have the same strength as one made with freshly-mixed material. In mixing, always mix the cement and sand together thoroughly before adding the water. One can judge by the color of the mass, fairly well, as to whether the mixing is complete. If the color is uniform -throughout, it is a pretty good sign that the aggregates are well distributed through the mass. When making a mixture containing cement, sand, and stone, always mix the cement and sand dry first and then add the stone, which has previously been well soaked in water. In this way one is assured of having each stone coated with the cement and sand; for as soon as the damp stone comes in contact Avith the dry cement and sand, it adheres to them and covers the stones completely; thus a compact matrix of cement and sand is formed between each and every particle of stone, and binds them securely together into a dense and compact mass. -The accompanying illustrations show some interesting examples of decorative flower pots. These look as though they were difficult to produce, but they are easy to make when one knows how. The first thing to do is to prepare a mold. Figs. 83, 84, and 85 show detail drawings of a wooden mold for a flower pot 9 inches square by 10 inches high, and Figs. 86 and 87 show half-tone illustrations of a wooden mold for a pot 14 inches -Fig. 82 — Good Examples of Hand Modeled Vases, Inlaid with Hand Made Moravian Tile — Executed by Frank Nahodyl -square by i8 inches high. It will be noticed that the cores in both of these cases are different. The collapsible core, shown in Fig. 84, is undoubtedly the best, as there is less fear of breaking the cast when removing it. It takes a trifle longer to make, but in the end it will pay. After complet-ing the mold, the concrete mixture should be made up. It should consist of i part Portland cement and from 2 to 3 parts of sand or marble dust. These should be mixed together dry as previously explained, and enough water added to make it of -the consistency of a thin putty or heavy cream. The next operation after mixing is the placing of this plastic mass into the mold. This is done as follows: First fill the mold solid up to a level with the bottom of the core, pack the cement down well, and then place the core box in position. -as shown is Figs. 85 and 86. Be sure that it is centered in the box. Ihis is important, for if the core is not exactly in the center, the sides of the pot will not be of equal thickness. -A good way to center and secure the core in position is to nail a strip of wood to it, and in turn nail the ends of this strip to the top of the -outside form, as shown in Figs. 85 and 86. After the mold has been placed and secured as above, fill the rest of the mold with the plastic concrete. When the mixture reaches the top of the mold -smooth it off nicely, and set the mold and its contents on a le^\\'el place to let the concrete set or harden. In about twelve hours from the time of pouring (do not let it be longer than this, for if so the concrete will be too hard for treatment) the concrete will be sufficiently hard to remove -the molds. This should be done carefully, in order not to break the corners, as the concrete is yet more or less soft. In removing the mold, take -the core out first. To do this, first remove the small strips a and b, which have been nailed from the inside, as indicated in Fig. 84. On removing -these strips, the V-shaped sections c will be released from the sections d and e, and can then be forced toward the center of the pot and drawn out. After these V-shaped sections have been -removed, the sides / will be free, and can be collapsed toward the center of the box and in turn can be removed. The bottom, which is made in two pieces, as shown, will then release itself freely. It would be well to grease the outer part of the core before placing the concrete, as this -will allow of the core being released more readily than if it were not done. If a solid core is used, as indicated in Fig. 86, a direct pull must be given to remo\\\\\\'e it from the cast. The best way to remove a core of this kind is shown in Fig. 88. In Fig. 89 is shown an Illustration of the cast after it has been removed from the mold. The outline of a design has been drawn on It, and the modeler -is just starting to cut the design out. As the concrete is still in a soft state, this can be readily done by scraping the surface with steel tools of the proper shape. Fig. 90 shows the piece after the modeling Is practically finished. The modeler is shoAvn here in the act of touching up some of the finer detail. Fig. 82 shows two pots cast in the same mold as described above. These pots -are also modeled by hand, after being taken from the mold, but in addition to the modeling they are also embellished with hand-made Moravian tile. There are various methods employed for Inserting these tiles In the outer surfaces of the pots. -A simple method for doing this is to place in the inner surface of the outer mold a negative mold. This negati\\\\\\'e mold is made of wood and should be of the exact shape, but a trifle larger in size than that of the tile which is to be inserted. -These negative molds can be nailed in the desired position to the inside of the outer mold, and then on drawing or stripping the outer mold from the cast, a cavity will be left in the outer surface of the pot, into which the tiles can be cemented in place. -to bore small holes through the outer forms, and secure the tiles in their proper position on the inside of the outer forms by tying them in place by string as indicated in Fig. 81;, care being taken to see that the ornate side of the tile is placed next to the woocl. The concrete is then poured the same as though an unornamented pot was being cast. Before removing the outer forms in this -case, howe^•er, the strings which hold the tile in place should be cut. 1 his is perhaps an easier method of placing the tile than that of making a negative mold. But in some cases it is hard to -Fig. 92 — Vase made with White Marble Chips and Trap Rock inlaid with Moravian Tile — Executed by Albert Mover -get the plastic concrete to flow completely around the tile. If in removing the forms, however, it is foujid that there are some places where the concrete has not run up to the tile, these holes or -voids as they are called can be filled in or pointed up with cement mortar. This method of making pots or vases will be found most interesting, as it is suggestive of an unlimited number of designs and combinations, each of which will contain more or less individuality. -Sun dials, statuettes, and vases mounted on ornamental pedestals add greatly to the picturesqueness of the modern garden. Ihese pedes-It is of simple design, and one which lends itself nicely to the material, inasmuch as the forms in -Fig. 95— Detail of Base Mold which to cast it are easily made. Fig. 94 is an outline sketch of the pedestal, In which are given its general dimensions, and Figs. 95, 97, 98, 100, -and i(J2 show details of the molds in which it is cast. Fig. 96 shows the various parts of the mold before assembling. Fig. 99 shows the shaft mold -assembled in position ready to pour, and Tig. loi shows the three finished pieces of the pedestal before setting them up. -sides 5 inches high. In the center of the bottom of this box is placed a tapered core, so as to produce a hole in the cast to correspond in size to -the outside dimensions of the plug on the bottom of the shaft of the pedestal, as shown in Fig. loi. 1 he mold for the top or cap of the pedestal is -shown in Fig. 97. This like the base mold is merely a square box. It is 4 inches deep, and a \\' j-inch tapered plug is phiceil in the center of its bottom as shown, in order to produce a \\'j-inch -hole in the bottom of the cap in which to insert the \\'.\\'2 -inch reinforcing rod, which passes through the entire length of the shaft, as shown in the assembled drawing. Fig. 102. Strips of 2-inch quarter-round stock molding mitered at the corners, as shott\\'n, arc placed in the bottom of this -mold in order to give the desired outline to the lower portion of the cap. The main shaft mold is made in three pieces, as shown in Fig. 102. Fig. 98 shows the details of the sides of the main part of the shaft mold. The recessed panels shown ii^ the sides of the pedestal in Fig. 93 can either be -inokl, :is shown at C, Fig. 98, should be attached to the inner side of each side of the shaft mold as shown. The edges of this negative mold for the panel should be be\\\\-eled off as indicated in the sectional dra^^\\'ing, so as to allow it to be released readily from the cast when remo\\\\\\'ing the forms. Details of parts B and C of the shaft mold are shown in Fig. iijo. Part B is a bottomless box lu inches square on the inside, with sides 6 inches high, and in it are secured, on all four sides, and mitered at the corners as shoA^\\'n, pieces of 2-inch quarter-round stock moldmg. These are securely fastened to the sides i inch from the top. Part C of the mold is made of four pieces of i-inch board as shown, on -which is built up the cone \\'i^hich forms the lug on the bottom of the shaft. Part J of the mold at its top should have secured to it, on all four sides, pieces of 2-inch by i-inch tapered strips, as shown by the shaded portion at d \\\\n Fig. H)2. The outside dimensions of these strips should be such that the inner portion of part B fits o^er them snugly. -1 he bottom of part ./ of the mold should ha\\\\-e a 9/16-inch hole \\'j inch deep bored in its center in which to place the \\' _.-inch steel reinforcing rod, as shown. After having completed the \\\\\\'arious parts of the mold as described above, sandpaper the inner surfaces of them and gi\\\\\\'e them two coats ol shellac; let this dr)\\' thoroughly, and then oil tlie insitle sindace well with a fairly thin oil. Now assemble the shaft mold, letting section A stand -on end, as shown in Hg. iu2. Place section B in position as shown, care being taken to let the quarter-round molding rest snugly down on the pieces d of section A. I hen place the steel rod in position, and commence to deposit the concrete mixture. If a white shaft is desired, use one part of white Portland cement and two parts of Avhite marble screenings ranging in size from dust up to .\\\\s inch. Mix these together dry, and then add enough A\\\\\\'ater to make a fairly thick paste. Fill the mold flush with the top of part B, tapping the sides and jarring part A of the mold occasionally to settle the concrete mixture as it is being deposited. When the concrete is flush with the top of section B, place section C in position, and proceed to fill it flush with the top. A11o\\\\athe concrete to set or harden in the molds for at least twenty-four hours before attempting to remo\\\\-e the molds. In securing the molds together use as few nails as possible, and in remo\\\\\\'ing the mold from the cast, great care must be taken in loosening them, so as not to in)ure the casts. In remo\\\\-ing the shaft mold, take off part C first, then part B, and finally section A. The base and cap molds should be filled with the same mixture as above, and should also be allowed to set for at least twenty-four hours before remo\\\\\\'ing the forms. It would be well to insert in the base, when casting, ffiur pieces of )_>-inch round or square steel reinforcing bars placed as indicated by the dotted lines in Fig. 95. These will add -greatly to its strength, and will prevent it from cracking in case the foundation, upon which the pedestal Is placed, Is not perfectly true and level. -If by any chance the casts should be injured, in removing them from the molds, they should be well wet down with \\\\Aater and pointed up with a mortar made of i part white Portland cement and I part of marble dust mixed v. ith enough water to produce a fairly thick paste. -After ha\\\\-ing pointed up the ^■arious parts of the pedestal they should be allrjwed to stand for a short time, and then all of the pieces should be well soaked with water occasionallv c\\\\er\\\\\\' da\\\\\\' fcuat least ten days. I his wetting down is kn()\\\\\\\\n as the curing process, and it should be well attended to, as the hardness and durabilit\\\\of the product prockiced depend largely upon the care taken In properly curing the casts. -After the pieces ha\\\\e become thorougiih\\' hai\\\\lened or cured the\\\\\\' can be assembled or set up \\\\n position, as shown In 1igs. 93 and 04. Ihc surfaces of the parts which are to be joined together should be sprinkled with -water, and cii\\\\ered with a thin layer of cement mortar composed of i part of \\\\\\\\iiite Portland cement and 1 part of marble dust. Thev should be placed on each other, and worked around with a twisting motion until bedded in place. 1 he surplus cement Mhich Is forced out at the joints should then be smoothed off, and the pieces allowed to set, without being disturbed, for from one to tA^o days, In which time thev will be firmly secured In place. -the effect produced will resemble that of white marble. If one prefers the gray color of ordinary Portland cement, the mixture used should -then be composed of i part Portland cement to 2 parts of good clean sand and 2 parts of trap rock screenings or pebbles not to exceed ^2 inch -usually made of brass or bronze, and their weight is sutfTcient to holil them ilown. When ]ilaeing a -sun dial, always see that its vane points to the north and that the pedestal is placed in the full rays of the sun. It would also be Mell to prepare a good solid foundation for the pedestal to rest -Fig. 109— Vases and Pedestals of Bold Design Lend Themselves Nicely to Concrete— F.xeciited by Emerson 5c N\\'orris Co. -on, for il this is not elone it is apt to settle as the ground becomes soft in the spring time. In fact, all heavy garden furniture should be provided -with good solid foundations. Ihese foundations should be from 2 to 3 feet deep, and in size should correspond to the size of the base of the piece which is to rest upon them. To prepare a foundation of this kind, all that is necessary is to dig a hole of the desired size and depth and to fill it with a mixture of i part Portland cement, 3 parts of sand, and 5 parts of broken stone or gravel. Add enough water to this to make it of the consistency of a thick pasty mass. Tamp it down well and le\\\\\\'el it off and alloN\\\\it to set or harden for twenty-four hf)urs, in which time the piece can be placed in position on it. In I\\'ig. id^ is shown a pedestal of the same general lines as that shown in Fig. 93, the design, howe\\\\er, being somewhat elaborated. To produce a pedestal of this kind requires the incorporation of a plaster mold which is of a more complicated nature than the mold described abo\\\\-e. Numerous other designs of pedestals are shown herewith,\\' so as to give to the reader some idea of the wide possibilities in design which can be obtained with concrete. -The accompanying illustration, Fig. iii, shows a concrete bench which is especially designed with a view of meeting the demand for a simple yet artistic piece of lawn furniture, and at the same time can be made with a minimum amount of skill and expense by those who are as yet uninitiated in this work. A detail drawing of the -end supports or the bench pedestals is shown in Fig. 112, and details of each piece used in the making of the wood mold for these end supports are sho^Mi in Fig. 113. The assembled mold ready for placing the concrete is shown in Figs. I 15 and 116. -The first thing to do is to procure a i-inch board, 12 inches wide by 16 inches long, and cut it to the shape shown in Fig. 1 13 at A. This is to be used for the bottom of the mold, as shown in Fig. 115. Now cut another piece of board, also I -inch thick, shaped as shown in Fig. 113 at B, and nail it down in its proper position on piece A. -The next piece to make is piece C in Fig. 113. Fhis piece forms the recessed panel; this panel as shown in Fig. 112 is only \\' _> inch deep, therefore this piece should be made of \\' j-inch board. Xail this securely in position, as sho«\"n In Fig. 1 1 q on piece B. Be sure to be\\\\-el the edges of pieces B and C, as shown by the dotted lines in Fig. iiq, for If this Is not done, one will have trouble in releasing the mold from the concrete when It Is set -or hardened. Now proceed to make the pieces D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, and i\\\\/ all of i-inch thick material, care being taken to follow the dimensions given closely. When thfc\\'se pieces are -all made, assemble them as shown in Fig. iii^, using as few nails as possible in securing the pieces to one another; for when the concrete is hardened, the form or mold will have to be removed from -it, and the fewer the nails used, the easier the form can be stripped from the cast. In making the form use green or unseasoned wood, as it is less liable to warp when the wet concrete mixture comes in contact with it. Before assembling the mold, each piece should be shellacked thoroughly -on both sides as well as on the ends. This will in a great measure prevent the mold from absorbing moisture, and will thus prevent any tendency of the mold to Avarp or buckle. After ha\\\\-ing assembled the pieces, as shown in Figs. 115 and 116, if for any reason the joints do not match up as well as they might, they can be filled with -After having trued the mold up, the inside of it should again be shellacked, and when thoroughly dry, a thin coat of fairly thick oil should be given to all parts of the mold which will come in contact with the wet concrete. The mold is now ready to be filled with the concrete mixture,_, which should be composed of i part Portland cement, 2 parts of good clean sharp sand, and 2 parts of trap rock or pebbles ranging in size from j-4 inch to J-2 inch. The method of mixing the concrete is as follows: It is important to follow the directions closely, for if the concrete is not properly mixed, an inferior product will be the result. I\\'irst the sand should be e\\\\\\'enly spread 011 a Ie\\\\-el xxatcr-tight platform. The cement should then be spread upon the sanci. Then, after thoroughly mixing the cement and sand together until it is of a uniform color, water should be added, preferably by spraying, and the mass thoroughly turned o\\\\-er and o\\\\-er by means of a sho\\\\-el or hoe until it is of a uniform consistency of a fairlv thick putty. To this mortar should be added the stone or gravel, which has preA\\'iously been drenched with water, and the whole mass shouki then be mixed or turned o\\\\\\'er until the aggregate or stone is thoroughlv coated M\\'ith mortar. An ordinary garden rake is a good tool ^ith which to distribute the stones through the mortar, as it distributes them more uniformly than a sho^\\'cl. -7 he concrete thus mixed should be deposited in the form or mold as soon after mixing as possible. Under no conditions deposit concrete in molds which has been mixed more than two hours. To fill the mold use a shovel, care being taken to -deposit the concrete into all of the corners. Tamp or tap it ciown well with the end of a piece of board. If the concrete has been properly mixed, this tamping will bring to the surface of the mass a slight skim of water. The mold should first -be about half filled, and then a strip of Clinton wire cloth or other steel reinforcing fabric should be placed in the form, as shown by the dotted hues in the plan \\\\-ie\\\\\\\\\\' of the assembled mold in Fig. I 15. The proper size of wire cloth to use is that known as 3-inch by 12-inch mesh, made of Nos. 8 and 10 gage steel wire. If wire cloth is -not a\\\\ailablc, any good No. 8 gage steel wire, cut and placed as shown, will answer the purpose. After ha\\\\ing placed the reinforcing, continue to deposit the concrete, and tamp it down until it is le\\\\el with the top of the sides D and E of the mold. Scrape or float this surface level, and then take the cross strips /, and M , shown in V\\\\g. i i :;, -and secure them to the top of the mold and against the end pieces H I and / A\\', as shown by the dotted lines in the side elevation in Fig. 115. These cross pieces not only act as a form for the edges a and b of the pedestal, as shown in Fig. 112, but they also act as a brace to the sides of the form, and prevent them from spreading apart, -After ha\\\\\\'ing secured these pieces in place, fill the portion of the mold thus formed flush with the top of the strips and the end pieces G and F. Tamp the concrete down, and smooth the surface off nicely. The filling of the mold Is now complete, and it should not be disturbed for at least -twenty-four hours, after which the cement should be wet down occasionally with a spray for at least a day. After having set or hardened for two days, the cast can be remo\\\\\\'ed from the mold, and can be set aside to be cured or to harden up. I his is done by sprinkling it with water two or three times a day for at least seven to ten days. Care should be taken when remo\\\\-ing the mold not to injure it or the cast, as the mold if not broken can be used o\\\\-er and o\\\\\\'er again. In remo\\\\-ing the mold from the cast, first detach the cross strips L and M , then the pieces H , /, J , and /\\\\, then the end pieces F and G, next the side pieces E and D, and then the bottom piece, composed of pieces A, B, and C. Before using the molci again, it should be thoroughly cleaned of any particles of cement \\\\^hich may have adhered to it. After having cleaned it well, oil the inside and proceed to assemble it as before, anci cast the other pedestal for the bench in a similar manner as explained above. -The next step is to cast the slab or seat of the bench. Ihis is 5 feet long by 18 inches ^^•ide by 3 inches thick. The form or mold for this is nothing more or less than an oblong box, having a bottom q feet long by 18 inches wide and four sides each 3 inches high, as shown in Fig. 118. The bench seat should be reinforced with the same size of wire cloth as was used in the pedestals, or by three \\'4-inch round rods spaced 6 inches apart. The reinforcing steel should extend -within 3 inches of all four sides, and should be placed about j% inch from the under surface of the slab, as shown in Fig. 1 18. -It would be well to clearly mark the under surface of the slab, so as to know which surface the reinforcing is nearest to, after the slab is cast, as it is important when placing the slab on the pedes-tals to always have the reinforcing nearest the underside of the seat. Shellac and oil the inside of the mold, and proceed to fill it with a mixture composed of the same material as was used for the pedestals. First fill the mold to a depth of K inch, and then lay in the reinforcing as indicated in Fig. 118, and on top of this place the remaining -i-Yi inches of concrete and tamp it down well. This top surface will be the top of the finished bench seat, therefore it will pay to take pains in finishing it to as smooth a surface as one can. Cure or harden the slab in the same manner as described for curing the pedestals. It is well, however, not to attempt to remove the under part of the mold for at least from seven to ten days. The sides of the form can be removed any time after forty-eight hours. -A good smooth surface can be given to the bench by wetting it down well and rubbing it with a fairly fine grade of carborundum brick. By tooling the recessed panel in the outer sides of the pedestals by means of gently striking the surface with a chisel and hammer, a good stony effect will be produced, which will greatly add to the appearance of the ends. -If on taking off the mold the cast should in any way be injured, the damaged parts can readily be replaced or filled in by applying and forming into shape cement mortar composed of i part cement to i or 2 parts of sand. Before applying this mortar, be sure to wet down the surface of the cast thoroughly, for if not, trouble will be had in securing a good and permanent bond. In setting the bench up, place the pedestals about 7 inches in from the ends of the slab, as shown in the illustration. -place. If one should wish the top edges of the slab beveled off, a triangular strip of wood can be secured along the bottom edges of the mold, as shown in the cross section of the slab mold in Fig. 118. -By following along the same general directions as given for making the bench shown in Fig. 1 1 i, one may elaborate on the design of the bench ped-estals. For instance, in Fig. 1 19 is shown a pedestal having curved outlines. The mold for this is made similar to the mold shown in Fig. 115, with the exception of the sides. A simple way to make a form for a design of this kind is to use sheet tin or thin galvanized iron, as shown in Fig. 119. If one has not the facilities for cutting and bend-\\\\ng the tin to shape, any tinsmith will do it for a triHing cost. All that is necessary to do in this case is to furnish the tinsmith ^Yl\\\\:\\\\\\\\ a lull-sized drawing of the outline required and the width of the tin of \\\\\\\\-hich to make it. This \\\\\\\\idth will he the same as the depth of the mold, and in no case need the depth of the mold be more than 7 inches. It is always \\\\\\\\e\\\\\\\\ to brace these tin sides of the mold by means of strips of wood, as sho-iAii in Hg. 119. This will prevent them from bulging when the concrete mixture is placed in the mold. -Some ^•ery interesting surface effects can be obtained in the pedestals by using selected aggregates or stones. When using this method, the concrete is mixed exactly as previously explaineil, with the exception that Instead of using plain pebbles or trap rock, one should use trap rock anci white marble or broken-up red brick. The size of the pieces used should not exceed \\' j inch to \\'\\'4 inch. Place the mixture in the mold as previously explained, but instead of allowing it to remain there for two days as before, remo\\\\\\'e the forms in from eighteen hours to t\\\\venty-four hours. The concrete \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ then be found a little soft. By spraying the cast with water and gently brushing the surface -with a good stiff brush, the sind\\'ace cement will be retno\\\\\\'ed, and the stone and marble and pieces of red brick will gradually be exposed, thus producing a surface more or less resembling mosaic. The possibilities of the effects which can be obtainctl with this treatment, as pre-viously explained, are only limited by the colors and size of the stone aggregates which are available for use. If any surface cement should remain on the stones or exposed aggregate after the above treatment, a solution composed of i part commercial muriatic acid to 4 parts of M-ater can be applied to the surface of the cast by means of a -brush. This solution should be allowed to remain on the surface for from fifteen to twenty minutes. Then the surface should be thoroughly cleaned off by means of washing with good clean water and a stiff brush. This acid treatment will cut away all surplus cement and will leave all of the stones clean and bright, thus producing a surface full of life and sparkle, -Concrete fences are becoming more in favor e\\\\ery year, for the reason that they always lool< substantial and neat, and at the same time require practically no expense for maintenance. -on. Care should always be taken to see that the base is placed deep enough in the ground to obviate all trouble which may arise from frost or the heaving of the ground in the spring of the year. The depth of the foundation depends large-ly upon locality and the nature of the soil, but usually a depth of from i8 inches to 3 feet from the surface of the ground is sufficient to o\\\\\\'ercome any trouble from frost. -To prepare the foundation, a trench should first be dug, as shown in Fig. 121. This should be about 14 inches wide. The depth depends, as stated above, upon the locality and nature of the soil. The bottom of the trench should be well tamped down, so as to make a good solid bottom on which to deposit the concrete «-hich should be composed of 1 part Portland cement, 3 parts of sand, and i; parts of broken stone or graxel. This mixture should be placed while fairly -wet, and should be well tamped down and lc\\\\eled off. 1 he foundation after having set or hardened for from one to three days will be ready to rccei\\\\e the fence posts and rails or panels \\\\\\\\\\'hich may be of various designs. -The fence posts are usually made in wooden molds, and set up anci cemented in place on the foundation after they are finished. The posts and post caps are cast separatelv, as shown in Figs. 122 and 123. A detail of the post mold is shown in Fig. 122. It consists, as shown, of a square box built up of i-inch boards. These posts can be made of any desired dimensions. As a rule, a good size is about 12 inches square by from 3 feet to 4 feet high. A mixture composed -of I part Portland cement, 2 parts of Sind, and 4 parts of broken stone or gravel should be used for making the posts. -posited \\'while in a pasty state. It should be well tamped down, and by working the heavy stone away from the sides of the mold, while depositing, by means of a wooden paddle or pitchfork, thus allowing the finer particles of cement and sand to come to the face of the mold a smooth surface -will be obtained on the cast. It would be well to shellac and grease the mold before depositing the concrete. Be sure to get the top and bottom of the mold square with the sides, for if this is not done, more or less trouble will be had in truing the posts up when placing them in position on the base or foundation. -dimensions of the finished cap. The bottom or curved portion of the cap, shown at A, can be produced by securing to the inside bottom edges of the mold strips of wood molding of any desired shape neatlv mitered at the corners as shown. This molding comes in standard sizes and shapes, -and can be procured In long strips at almost any carpenter\\'s shop. Shellac and oil the inside of this mold well before placing the concrete, for if one neglects to do this, trouble will be had in stripping the moki from the cast. When stripping or removing the mold from the cast, remove all four sides first before attempting to remove the bottom. It will be noted that the molding is secured to the bottom of the mold only, the four sides merely resting snugly against it when the mold is assembled. Care should also be taken to level off and trowel smoothly the top of the cap after the concrete is placed in the mold. Use the same mixture for casting these caps as was used in making the posts. -Various designs are resorted to in filling in between the posts in fence work, such as balasters, scroll designs, panels, etc. The diamond or lattice clesign of railing or panel, shown in Fig. 124, is largely used for porch work as well as fences. It is cast in one piece and is reinforced with a sheet of 6-inch mesh No. 4 expanded metal placed in the center of the concrete strands which are made about 2 inches square. The expanded metal reinforcing lends itself nicely to this design, inasmuch as the meshes are of a diamond shape. If, however, this metal is not available, ^\\'s-inch round or square steel rods can be used for reinforcing the panel, with good results. The method of -making a fence panel of this kind is simple. All that is required in the way of a form is a box 2 Inches deep by the desired height and length of the panel which is to be made. In the bottom of this box locate the position of the diamond-shaped holes. Then make of wood as many diamond-shaped blocks as are required, and secure them by nails in their proper position to the bottom of the mold. Allow a good draft or taper on all sides of the blocks as shown, so that the fence panel when cast can be easily withdrawn from the mold. Before casting, shellac and oil well all parts of the -mold that will come in contact \\\\\\\\ith the wet concrete. When the mold is complete, as shown in Fig. 125, place about i inch of concrete in it, then place the sheet of expanded metal or steel rods in position on it, and proceed to fill the moki flush with the top. Level off the concrete and allow it to set for two or three days, occasionally wetting it down ^^•ell ^^ith water. After the concrete is hardened, the mold can easily be removed by gently taoping the surface of the exposed diamond -blocks here and there throughout surface of the mold. An)\\' corners of the cast that may have been broken (;r injured in removing the cast from the mold can be readily pointed up ^-lith a mixture of cement mortar composed of 1 part Portland cement to 2 parts of sand. 1 he whole surface of the panel can then be well wet down and painted with a mixture of neat cement and water mixed to the consistency of a thick cream; this on drying -out will produce a good uniform color to the whole piece. The concrete mixture used in making this panel should be composed of i part Portland cement, 2 parts of sand, and 2 parts of gra\\\\-el or broken stone, not to exceed \\'4 inch in size. -should be piro\\\\-ided with a groo\\\\-c 2\\'s Inches to 2\\' 4 inches wide by \\' _• inch to -_[ inch deep in the middle of their t«o opposite sides, as shown in Fig. 122. This is to allow of the ends of the panels to set into the posts, .\\\\fter ha\\\\-mg located the panel in its proper position in the groo\\\\\\'e or recess, the recess should be filled in with cement -mortar flush with the face of the post, thus producing a good smooth finish as well as firmly cementing the panel in place. -The panels should be topped off with a coping, as shown in Fig. 124. The underside of this coping should also be pro\\\\\\'ided with a groo\\\\\\'e, as shown in Fig. 126, of the same dimensions as the grooves in the sides of the posts, so that it can be let down on and securely cemented to the top of the panel. This coping can be cast in a wooden mold made as shown in Fig. 126. A strip of wood, tapered on the sides as shown, can be used to form the groo\\\\\\'e in the bottom of the coping. The mold should first be filled to within the thickness of this strip from its top. The strip should then be centered, and the concrete filled in on both sides of it until flush with the top of the mold. A mixture composed of i part Portland cement to 3 parts of sand and fine gravel will give good results for this class of work. -Another very eftective panel for fences is the rubble panel made of field stone shown in Fig. 127. This is made in a mold composed of four pieces of 2-inch by 4-inch lumber. This frame is made of the desired size of the finished panel. It is then laid dott\\'n flat on a good level piece of ground and filled in with about i inch of cement mortar com-posed of I part Portland cement and 3 parts of sand. A sheet of steel reinforcing mesh such as expanded metal or steel rods is then placed on top of this I inch of mortar, and over the reinforcing is deposited about 2 inches more of the cement mortar, into which the field stones are embedded. -The stones before embedding into the mortar should be well wet down. 1 his panel should be allowed to harden, before attempting to raise it from its position, for at least from four to six days. It should also be occasionally well sprinkled with water. After it has thoroughly hardened it can be set up in place between the fence posts in a similar manner as explained for setting u].i the diamond design of panel. After this panel has been set in place, the rough side of it can be cleaned off and well wet down and finished, by means of plastering it with a cement mortar macie of I part Portland cement to from 2. to 3 parts of sand. -The same rubble effect can be obtained in a solid •\\\\\\\\-all by building up on the foundation a ^^-ooden mold, as shown in Fig. 128. This mold should then be tilled in with heavy and light iield stone, and «hen the mold Is filled le\\\\-el with the top, a fairly thin creamy mixture of i part Portland cement to 2 parts of sand can be poured into the mold. This cement grout as it is called will find its way into all of the cre\\\\ ices or ^\"oids bet\\\\\\\\\\'een the stones, and Avill securely cement them together. I\\'he moki should be remcned in from twelve to twenty-four hours at the longest. The sm-facc of the wall sliould then be scrubbed down well \\\\\\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\ a good stiff wire brush and plentv of water. J his treatment will remo\\\\\\'e all of the surface cement, -and thus expose the stone to view, n uc^iicu, a coping can then be cemented to the top of the wall, as shown in Fig. 127, A wall of this kind can be made of any length. Fence posts can then be cast -in place at the ends, or they can be cast sejiarately, as pre\\\\nously explained and set up in place. -AsscmhUng Panel Fences As stated abo\\\\-e, when panels are used in the construction of a fence, the posts should always be cast with a groove or recess for them to fit into. When assembling a panel fence, the first post should be firmly cemented in position on the foundation or base with a mixture of cement mortar -composed of 1 part Portland cement to 2 parts of sand. One end of the panel should then be located in the groove in the fence post, and should be temporarily held in position until the next post is mo^\\'ed up into place, so as to engage the other end of the panel in the groove cast in its side. The second post and the panel should then be trued up and held in position by wooden wedges. The whole then should be firmly cemented in place with cement mortar, and the remaining posts and panels set up in like manner on the foundation until the fence is complete. -Low cement copings, such as shown in Fig. 129, are much in vogue along the sides of paths as well as sometimes being used to indicate the di\\\\\\'iding line between two pieces of property. These copings can be easily constructed by the use of two boards, a few wooden pegs, and a metal template cut to the desired outline of the top of the finished coping. The first thing to do is to set the boards up along the foundation or base, as shown in Fig. 130, which has previously been made to the desired width, then drive in the wooden pegs as shown, spacing them about 16 inches apart. Nail the side boards to them firmly, anci then line up the sides and level off the top of the boards. Now fill in the space between the boards with a mixture of I part Portland cement and 4 parts of fairly coarse sand. -Do not make this mixture too wet. Now make a former or template out of a heavy piece of tin or galvanized iron. Cut this to the form of the desired shape of the top of the coping, and nail it securely to a piece of i-Inch board as shown in the illustration. Place this in position on the top of the two side boards, letting the edges of it lap over the sides of the hoards, as shown at J . -Now on the cement already placed bet\\\\A\\'een the side boards build up more of the mixture until it reaches high enough to be scraped or cut off bv the template as it is mo\\\\\\'ed back and forth o\\\\-er the top of the side boards. Keep adding cement to the top of the coping and packing it tlown, at the same time mo\\\\ing the template back and forth until a goocf smooth e\\\\\\'en siwface is obtalncil of the same outline as the cut-out portion of the template or former. -Probably one of the oldest designs of fence, and one that is still popular for certain architectural effects, is the balustrade. This is made up of a number of small pillars set on a base and topped oft with a coping, as indicated in the half-tone illustration, Fig. I ■; I . Formerlv these balustrades were made of stone or marble, and were used only in the highest class of work, owing to their great cost, due to the fact that each baluster had to be -cut out of a solid block or piece of stone. These balustrades are now made of concrete, and are used in places where formerly, owing to their expense, their use was prohibitive. The half-tone illustrations shown in Figs. 132, 133, 134, 135, and 136 show different views of the -plaster mold in which the balusters are cast, as Avell as the various steps in the making of a concrete baluster. The first thing to do in order to make the mold for a concrete baluster is to procure a model. This can be of either wood, plaster, or stone, or it can be modeled in clay. -Perhaps the cheapest way would be to procure from a carpenter or builder a stock model of a wood baluster of pleasing design. This should be well coated with two or three coats of shellac. -it should then be oiled and placed on the working bench, as shown in V\\\\g. 137A square block of plaster ./, i inch to I\\'j inches in thickness, to correspond in size and shape to the base B of the baluster, should then be made. -This should be placed and secured to the end of the bahister at B as indicated. Now take some modelers\\' clay, and place it along the entire length of the baluster from C to D, as indicated by the -shaded portions E and F in the end view No. I. Smooth off the surfaces G and // of the clay to an angle of about 45 degrees. After having prepared the clay on the model of the baluster as described above, block up the two ends by placing -partly fill it with water, and to this add plaster of Paris, at the same time stirring it well, until the mixture is of the consistency of thick cream. Pour -this mixture over the model of the baluster and into the cavity formed by the clay strips and the two end boards. Allow the plaster to set or harden for about ten minutes, after which time the clay and end boards can be remo\\\\-ed. Now turn the model over, letting it rest on the plaster shell just cast, as shown in the end view No. 2. Then proceed as before to cast a plaster shell on side A of the model, using the clay sides and end boards. After the plaster has hardened, remo\\\\c the cla)\\' and boards and turn the model o\\\\er into the position indicated in the end \\\\\\\\c\\\\x No. 3. Cut joggle holes in to the angular faces of the plaster shell as indicated in the various half-tone ilkistrations, then shellac and oil these surfaces aacII. Now proceed to cast section L ot the plaster moKl. ;\\\\fter this is hanlened, turn the model o\\\\ er again and cast section A^ of the mold, as shown in end \\\\-ie\\\\v No. 4. Let this harden f(iifrom ten ti> fifteen minutes. Now if the angular edges of the [ilaster ha\\\\\\'e been properly oiled as directed, a slight tapping here and there on the plaster shell \\\\\\\\\\'\\\\\\\\\\\\ be sufficient to release it from the model of the baluster. The inside of the plaster mold should now be cleaned up and be gi\\\\-en two coats of shellac. After drying it should be well oiled M\\'ith a fairly thick oil to prevent the cement when casting from adhering to it. Before assembling the various parts of the mold, a hole should be made in the center of the piece A. This hole should be about t< inch deep and large enough to -receive the end of a Is-\\'mch round steel rod. Each baluster should be cast with a rod of this size running through it, from end to end. This rod not only acts as a reinforcing for the baluster, but it also helps to hold them firmly in place when setting them up in the balustrade. Now assemble the various parts of the plaster mold, and secure them firmly together by irons shaped as shown in the half-tone illustrations. Figs. 134 and 131;. To cast the baluster, set the mold on end as shown in Fig. 134, and fill it with a mixture of i part Portland cement, 2 parts of sand, and 3 parts of broken stone or gravel not to exceed \\'4 inch in size. Mix these all together thoroughly, while dry, and then add enough water to this mixture to make it of a creamy consistency, so that it can be poured into the mold from a pail as shown. After pouring let the mold set on end, undisturbed, for about twenty-four hours. At the end of this time the concrete «-ill be hard enough to allow of the remo-\\\\\\'al of the mold. -Before casting the next baluster, clean and oil the inside of the mold well. If any part of the baluster should have been injured in removing the mold, it can be readily pointed up with a cement mortar made of i part Portland cement to 2 parts of sand. Wet the injured portion well before starting to point it up, for if this is not done, trouble wW] he had in getting the mortar to atlhere to the baluster. -be made in a similar manner as described for the maicing of the low coping, previously explained; but instead of having a curved outline to the top, the base upon which to set the balusters should be made flat. Holes can be made at proper intervals in the top of the base, to receive the \\'2-inch rods which are cast in the balusters, while the cement is still in a soft state. This will facilitate matters when setting up the balustrade. The coping can be cast in a square wooden mold in anv lengths desired in a similar manner as described for the casting of the coping for the lattice panel explained above. In setting up the balustrade wet all parts which are to be cemented together, and use a cement mortar composed of i part Portland cement to 2 parts of sand. -This type of fence is used where a good, neat, strong, and permanent structure is desired. Its life is practically unlimited, and the cost for maintenance, when properly built, is nothing. No molds or wooden forms are ree]ulred in Its construction. It is made up on a steel skeleton covered with metal lath. In the fence here Illustrated expanded metal lath was used. A detail of the steel skeleton or framework is shown in Fig. 138, and In Fig. 139 Is shown the progressive operations In the building of the structure. Fig. 140 shows the fence as it appears when completed. -Oil referring to Fig. 138, a clear idea of how the framework is assembled v^-xW be obtained. The posts are made of 3-inch steel I beams, and are rtrndy imbedded in a foundation of concrete i q inclies square by 3 feet deep. As sho\\'An the^\\' are -placed at 8 feet 3 inches centers, and the total height of the posts from the bottom of the foundation to their tops Is 9 feet. The top and bottom rails are made of 2j:/2-inch x 2j.2-inch steel angles. It will be noticed that the bottom rail is placed with the point of the angle down. The object of this is to relie\\\\-e the fence, to a large extent, from the upward pressure due to the rising -of the ground in the Spring time. If the bottom was left flat as is usually done, a elirect pressure would come on it, but by forming it as shown the tendency, when the ground rises, is for it to slide oft on each side; thus relie-s\\'ing the fence of the direct pressure which it would otherwise be subjected to. -angles, and in the center of these angles, as well as in the webs of the I beams used for the posts, are pro\\\\ided three ;\\'s-inch holes, through which are inserted three \\'4-inch round steel rods. -The first coat of cement mortar should be made up of I part Portland cement to 2 or 3 parts of fairly coarse sand, and should contain a sufiicient amount of long cow or goat hair to form a good key. The first coat should be applied to the thick-ness of about i inch, and its face should be well scratched to make a good key for the second coat to bond to. After this coat has been applied to one side of the lath and has become hard, the reverse side of the fence, the surface of which will appear very rough, should first be thoroughly saturated with water and then be plastered, to a like thickness, with a mortar of the same composition, except that the hair should be omitted. The posts should be treated with mortar in the same manner as the panels, forming them into shape as the A\\\\-ork progresses. The finishing coat can now be applied to both sides. The cement mortar for the finish should be of the same proportion as used for the first coat; but before applying it, be sure to saturate the first coat with water, for If this Is not done, a good bond between the first and finish coat will not be obtained. The top of the fence can be finished off square or a coping can be placed on it, as fancy dictates. If a coping is desired, it can he cast separately and set in place, or it can be run in place in a similar manner as pre\\\\Iously explaineci for making a low coping. -The surface of the fence can be finished with any one of the artistic surfaces which are possible to obtain with this material, such as a rough or smooth surface, slap dash, pebble dash, or rough cast. Even some color can be incorporated If so desired. The dimensions for the framework as well as the construction of the frame as given In Fig. 138 are of a specific case, and are given more -The gen.eral principles gi\\\\en for tlie construction of this t\\\\\\'pe of fence can he modified to suit any size or shape of fence demanded by the various conditions that may arise. -Aside from the tools described and illustrated throughout the various chapters, which can be made as the work progresses, one will reejuire one or more of the tools here mentioned, depending upon the class of work which is to be undertaken. -Pointing tools, steel float, wood float, rake, wire brush, scrubbing brush, trowels, straight edges, hoe, shovel, nippers (for cutting \\\\\\\\\\'ire), chisel (for cutting steel bars), shears (for cutting sheet metal), hand saw, wood plane, screw dri\\\\\\'er, hammer and a mixing box. -There are innumerable types of reinforcing materials on the market. To describe them all would take up too much space; therefore the author will here only call attention to the necessity of using reinforcing, and gl\\\\\\'e a few brief remarks as to why it is used. As the term implies, reinforcing is used to strengthen or reinforce the -s-arious objects made of concrete. When reinforcing is used in concrete, the product becomes a combination of steel and concrete and is known as \"reinforced concrete.\" Reinforcing is made of steel. -and the types which are most used for reinforcing the class of work described in the foregoing pages are in the forms of metal lath and of round or square steel rods. Concrete like all other materials expands and contracts under temperature changes; therefore, concrete articles of any size must be \\\\\\\\t\\\\\\\\ reinforced, not only to gi\\\\-e them additional strength with which to withstand handling, etc., but also to prevent them from cracking, due to the contraction and expansion of the material under the high temperature changes, which in our climate \\\\\\'aries from the cold of winter to the warmth of summer to about 1 10 degrees Fahrenheit. -Like all other materials such as stone, brick, marble, etc., cement absorbs more or less moisture. If, hott-ever, proper care is taken in the selection of the aggregates and in the proportioning of the mixture, there should be little trouble in obtaining a product that ^^-ill be sufHciently imper^•ious for all such objects as are described herein, such as concrete pottery and garden furniture. Tf, howe\\\\\\'er, one wishes to produce an article such as a vase, and desires that it should be absolutely impervious or waterproof, one can make it so by using a waterproofing compound. There are a number of such compounds on the market, all of which have more or less merit. The principle upon which all of these compounds is based is that -of filling up the pores or minute holes which are to be found in all materials of a similar nature to that of stone or concrete. These compounds are offered for sale in both powder and liquid form. Some are incorporated in the mixture, and others are used as a surface treatment after the article is complete. The latter class are the simplest to apply, and will answer well for the waterproofing of the articles described in the foregoing chapters. -/\\\\ PATENT pjives you an exclusive right to your invention for a term of seventeen years.

New York City -The statistics of manufactures for certain selected incrustries were published as separate bulletins as rapidly as the statistics were compiled These bulletins are now collected in the present volume, forming Volume X of the reports of the Thirteenth Census The figures in this volume may differ in some unimportant details from those given in the bulletins, for the reason that certain minor errors discovered in the bulletins as first published have been corrected -The text of the report for each industry summarizes the general results of the census inquiry, presenting a series of special tnbles in which the most important figures printed in the∑genern,l tables are given in convenient form -At the end of the report for each industry are two general tnbles, as follows: First, a comparative presentation for 1909, 1904, and 1899 of the number of establishments and of persons engaged in the industry, primary power, capital, salaries and wages, cost of materinls, value of products, and value added by manufacture, followed by a table giving statistics in detail by states for 1909 -In connection with the reports for the individual industries the explanations of the use of terms and the methods of compilation given in the paragraphs following should be borne in mind -Scope of census: Factory industries,Census statistics of manufactures are compiled primarily for the purpose of showing the absolute and relative magnitude of the different branches of industry covered and their growth or decline Incidentally, the effort is made to present data throwing light upon character of ownership, size of establishments, and similar subjects When use is made of the data for these purposes, it is imperative that clue attention should be given to the limitations of the figures, particularly in any attempt to derive from them figures purporting to show average wages, cost of production, or profits These limitations are fully discussed in the general report on manufactures for the United States as a whole (Volume VIII of Thirteenth Census Reports) and need not be repeated here -The census of 1909, like that of 19041 was confined by law to manufacturing establishments conducted under what is known as the factory 2ystem, excluding the neighborhood, household, and hand industries Where statistics for 1899 are given, they have been reduced to a comparable basis by eliminating the latter classes of industries The census did not cover establishments which were idle during the entire year, or had a value of products of less than $5001 or the manufacturing done in educational, eleemosynary, and penal institutions, or in governmental establishments, except those of the Federal Government Reports were secured for establishments operated by the Federal Government, and the statistics for such establishments are presented in the reports for the industries for which they were reported, though they are not included in the industry totals -Period covered,The returns relate to the calendar year 1909, or the business year which corresponds roost nearly to that calendar year, and cover a years operations, except for establishments which began or discontinued business during the year -The establishmentThe term \"establishment\" comprises the factories, mills, or plants which are under a common ownership or control and for which one set of books of account is kept -If, however, the plants constituting an establishment as thus defined were not all located within the same state, separate reports were secured in order that the :figures for each plant might be included in the statistics for the state in which it was located In some instances separate reports were secured for each of the different industries carded on in the same establishment -Classification by industriesThe establishments were assigned to the several classes of industries according to their products of chief value The value of products reported for a given industry may thus, on the one hand, include minor products very different from those covered by the industry designation, and, on the other hand, may not include the total product covered by this designation, because some part of this product may be made in establishments in which it is not the product of chief value -Persons engaged in manufacturing industries,At the censuses of 1899, 1904, and 1909 the following general classes of persons engaged in manufacturing industries were distinguished: (1) Proprietors and firm members, (2) salaried officers of corporations, (3) superintendents and managers, (4) clerks, and (5) wage earners In the reports for the censuses of 1904 and 1899 these five classes were shown according to the three main groups: (1) Proprietors and firm members, (2) salaried officials, clerks, etc, and (3) wage earners The second group included the three classes of salaried officers of corporations, superintendents and managers, and clerks, In certain tables relating exclusively to the present census a somewhat different grouping is employedthat into (1) proprietors and officials, (2) clerks, and (3) wage earners The :first group includes proprietors and firm members, salaried officers of corporations, and superintendents and managers In comparative tables covering the censuses of 1899 and 1904 it is of course necessary to group the figures for 1909 according to the classification that was employed in the earlier censuses -At this census the number of persons engaged in the industries, segregated by sex, and, in the case of wage earners, also by age (whether under 16 or 16 and over), was reported for December 15, or the nearest representative day The 15th of December was selected as representing for most industries normal conditions of employment, but where conditions were exceptional, and particularly in the case of certain seasonal indUJ3tries, such as canning and preserving, the December date could not be accepted as typical and an earlier date had to be chosen -In the case of employees other than wage earners the number thus reported for December 15, or other representative day, has been treated as equivalent to the average for the year, since the number of employees of this class does not vary much from month to month in a given industry In the case of wage earners the average is obtained in the manner explained in the -next paragraph In addition to the more detailed report by sex and age of the number of wage earners on December 15 or other representative day, a report was obtained of the number employed on the 15th of each month without futinction of sex or age From these :fi~ures the average number of wage earners for the year has been calculated by dividing the sum of the numbers -In 1899 and 1904 the schedule called for the average number of wage earners of each sex 16 years of age and over, and the average number under 16 years of age without distinction of sex, for each month, and these monthly statements were combined in an annual average Comparatively few manufacturing concerns, however, keep their books in such way as to show readily the average number of men, women, and children employed each month These monthly returns by sex and age were, in fact, largely estimates It was believed that a more accurate and reliable sex and age distribution could be secured by taking as a basis of estimate the actual numbers employed on a single day -Prevailing hours of labor,The census made no attempt to ascertain the number of employees working a given number of hours per week The inquiry called merely for the prevailing practice followed in each establishment Occasional variations in hours in an establishment from one part of the year to another were disregarded, and no attention was paid to the fact that a limited number of employees might have hours differing from those of the majority In t4e tables all the wage earners of each establishment are counted in the class within which the establishment itself falls In most establishments1 however all or practically all the employees work the sam~ ~umber of hours, so that these figures give a substantlally correct representation of the hours of labor in manufacturing industries -CapitalFor _re_asons stated in ~eports of prior censuses the stat1St1cs of capital secured by the census canvass are so defective as to be of little value, except -as indicating very general conditions The instructions on the schedule for securing capital were as follows: -The aJ1swer should show the total amount of capital, both owned and borrowed, on the last day of the business year reported All the items of :fixed and live capital may be taken at the amounts carried on the books If land or buildings are rented, that fact should be stated and no value given If a part of the land or buildings is owned, the remainder being rented, that fact should be so stated and only the value of the owned property given Do not include securities and loans representing investments in other enterprises -Materials,The statistics as to cost of materials relate to the materials used during the year, which may be more or less than the materials purchased during the year The term \"materials\" includes fuel, rent of power and heat, mill supplies, and containers, as well as materials forming a constituent part of the product Under the head of \"Fuel\" is included all fuel used, whether for heat, light, or power, or for the process of manufacture -Expenses,Under \"Expenses\" are included all items of expense incident to the years business, except interest, whether on bonds or other forms of indebtedness, and allowances for depreciation -Value of productsThe amounts given under this head represent the selling value or price at the factory of all products manufactured during the year, which may differ from the value of the products sold Amounts received for work on materials furnished by others are included -Value added by manufactureThe vnlue of products is not a satisfactory measure of either the absolute or the relative importance of a given industry, because only a part of this vitlue is actually created by the manufacturing processes carried on in the industry itself Another part of it, and often by far the larger part, represents the value of tho materials used, which are the products of agriculture or mining or of other manufacturing industries For many purposes, therefore, the best meas11re of tho importance of different classes of industry is the value created by the manufacturing operations carried on within the industry This value is obtained by deducting the cost of the -materials used from tho value of the products The :figure thus obtained is termed in the census reports \"value added by manufacture\" -There is a further statistical advantage which \"value added by manufacture\" has over gross value of products In combining the value of products for all industries the value of products produced by one establishment and used as materials in another is duplicated, and the total, therefore, gives a greatly exaggerated idea of the wealth created, No such duplication is involved in the total \"value added by manufacttue\" -Cost of manufacture and pro:flts,Census data do not show the entire cost of manufacture, and consequently can not be used to show profits No account has been taken of interest and depreciation Even if the amount of profit could be determined by deducting the expenses from the value of the products, the rate of profit on the investment could not properly be calculated, because of tho very defective character of the returns regarding capital -Primary horsepower,This item represents the total primary power generated by the manufacturing establishments plus tho amount of power, principally electric, rented by them from other concerns It does not cover the electric power developed by the primary power of the establishments themselves, the inclusion of which would evidently result in duplication  -The group of textile industries for which statistics are here presontocl comprises eight distinct industries, designated as follows: (1) \"Cotton goods, including cotton snrnll wares\"; (2) \"woolen, worsted, and folt goods, and wool hats 11 ; (3) \"carpets and rugs, other than rag\"; (4) \"hosiory and knit goods\"; (5) \"silk and silk goods, including throwsters \"; (6) \"cordage and twine and jute arnl linen goods\"; (7) \"shoddy\"; and (8) \"dyeing and finishing textiles\" Tho statistics for each of those inclustrios are presented in detail in subsequent chaptors of this roport In addition, a separate presentation is nui,clo :for tho wool scouring and -the wool pulling industries, though none of tho statistics for them have been included in the tables relating to tho general textile group This group of industries does not include the manufacture of rag carpets, haircloth, or furfelt hats, which industries are presented in tho general statistics of manufactures under classifications as follows: \"Carpets, rag,\" \"hats, furfelt,\" ttncl haircloth\" -Summary for 1909,Table 1 _presents a summary of the principu,1 statistics relating to tho eight industries constituting tho combined textile group for the census of 1009 -In compiling tho stlttisties for the eight industries named, 011ch establishment has been cl11ssifiod according to its product of chief v11luo There is considerable overl!tpping umong tho different industries, but so far as possible tlrn statistics of products common to two or more of tho industries are assembled, in tho chapter on the industry for which they constituto primary products, so us to show tho total production of tho giv<m product :in all industries combined There is also considorablo duplication in tho cost of materhtls and valuo of products for some of tho individual inclustrios, and still more in tho totnls for tho eight industries combined, by reason of tho use of tho products of one establishment or ono industry tts materials for other ost11blishmonts or other industries For example, somo of tho establishments classed under  cotton goods, including coUon small wares,\" make cotton yarn that is sold not only to other cotton ;mills but to establishments in other textile industries Tho extent of this practice in the combined textile industry is shown by :Pablo 10, which gives tho statistics for ynrns purchased fhe combination of tho value of -products of the yarnproducing mills with that of tho establishments in which tho yarn is used as a material obviously loads to duplication Again, tho p;loducts of tho shoddy industry are almost wholly used as a material :in tho wool manufactures -In considering tho relative importance of tho several textile industries it should bo borne in mind that tho differences among tho industries with respect to tho amount or duplication involved in the value of products render that standard somewhat inaccurate -It is clear from the table, however, that on the basis of any standard of measurement the cotton goods industry is the most important The cotton mills, including those making small wares, manufactured products in 1909 whose value represented 37 3 per cent of the total value of products for the eight textile industries combined, and gave employment to 43 per cent of tho total number of wage earners reported Cotton is tho most important material used in the manufacture of hosiery and lmit goods also, and those two cottonusing industries together contributed 492 per cont of tho total value of products for the eight -textile :industries and employed 577 per cent of the total number of wage earners The industry designated \"woolen, ~oi:sted, and felt -goods, and wool hats\" is the second m importance of this group, contributing 259 per cent of the total value of products and giving employment to 191 per cent of the total number of wage earners In_ the ca~et and rug branch of the industry also the chief matenal -used is wool, and these two industries together gave employment to 229 per cent of the wage earners and contributed 301 per cent of the value of products for -the textile group Comparison with earlier censuses,:T~ble 2 ~ummarizes the statistics of the eight textile mdustr10s representing the combined industry for each

comparable In comparing the :figures for value of products and cost of materials for the different censuses, it should be noted that the amount of duplication may have been greater relatively at one census than at another, though it is probable that no very great change has taken place Fluctuations in prices have, however, affected these∑ items materially, and the value added by manufacture as well1 though in the latter instance perhaps to a less extent The advance in prices during the decade 18991909 partly accounts for the fact that the percentages of increase in these three items during that decade were much higher than those for the decade 18891899 The number of wage earners and the primary horsepower, however, also increased somewhat more rapidly during the later than during the earlier decade -Comparative statistics for each census yoar boginning with 1879, for each of tho textile industries covered by this report and for the eight industries combined, are presented in Table

where the prevailing hours were 60 per week The two groups above named together included 88 per cent of the total number of wage earners, and these same hours of employment were the most common ones in each of the individual industries The larger proportion of the wage earners employed more than 60 hours per week (68,819 out of a total of 73,497) were in the cotton mills and the hosiery and knitting mills of the South Of the 68,819 wage earners, the cotton mills reported 64,844, or 942 per cent, and the hosiery and knitting mills, 3,975, or 58 per cent -Character of ownership,Table 7

11ffect either the proportion of spinners in the total number of wage earners or the nominal efficiency of the labor, the average number of spindles por wage oarnor for the United States as a whole is not without significance It shows the relation, nt least, between two statistical elements which are widely used as standards for measuring the growth of industries; and the industry as a whole is not subject to tho rapid and radical changes which sometimes affect the mills of a limited section Temporary labor troubles in New England in 1904 somewhat reduced tho average number of wage earners without making any corresponding reduction in the number of spindles re-, ported, thus rendering the average number of spindles per wage earner for that year somewlrnt higher than it would otherwise have been; but this cuso is exceptional Increasing rates of wages must be toJrnn into account, of course, in considering the wage cost per -spindle, and also the fact that sttlarios were to some extent included with wages at the earlier censuses Of somewhat more significance, perhaps, than the figures given in the preceding table, are statistics -The several states differ greatly in the number of spindles per spinner, the figures for tho Southern states being very much lower tlrnn those for tho New l~ngland states These <liITorences aro doubtfoss mainly attributable to differences in

materials used Formerly a distinction was made between those employing power in -the operation of the lmitting machines and those using hand machines, the statistics for tho latter class of establishments being presented under the -designation \"hand knit goods\" The distinction between the two classes of establishments, however, has lost most of its significance because tho use of powerdriven machines has become almost universal, and the present report covers both classes of establishments In 1909, 110 establishments were reported as using hand machines, those establishments manufocturing products valued at $1,571,939, giving employment to an average of 567 wage earners, and paying out $213,568 in wages and $824,991 for materials The rela-tively small importance of this class of establishments is indicated by the fact that they formed only 8 per cent of the total number of establishments in the industry in the United States, employed only fourtenths of 1 per cent of the total number of wage earners, and reported only eighttenths of 1 per cent of the total value of products -least part of the increase shown in cost of materia1s and value of products, however, is doubtless attributable to increased prices -The growth of the industry has been continuous throughout the period covered by Table 1, each census showing substantial increases as compared with that preceding The number of establishments reported for 1909 was more thanfive times as great as in 1869 and the value of products nearly eleven times as great The greatest relntivo growth took place during the decade 18791889, each item for which comparable -figures can be presented showing a greater percentage of increase for this decade than for any other covered by the table -As the proprietors and firm members were not reported separately prior to 1899, it is probable that, in the case of small establishments, a considerable number were included with the wage earners Salaried employees were also :included to some extent with wage earners at the earlier censuses The statistics of wage earners for the censuses of 1899, 1904, and 1909 are therefore more exactly comparable than are those for earlier censuses -Summary, by statesTable 2 sun:unarizes, by states, the more important statistics of the industry, the states being arranged according to the value of products

each state iri 1909, 1904, and 1899 is given in Table 30 The distribution of the average number by sex and age is not shown for the individual states, but Table 31 gives such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, or the nearest representative day The largest number of female wage earners 16 years of age and over (28,045) was employed in Pennsylvania, and the next lnrgest number (24,424) in New York The largest number of wage earners under 16 years of age -The proportion of children under 16 years of a~e was hi(lher in North Carolina (27 7 per cent) than m -In order to compare the distribution of the persons engaged in the industry according to occupational status in 1909 with that in 1904, it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 4 -Salaried employees show tho highest percentage of increase for the fiveyear period and proprietors and :firm members the lowest -Although the actual number of children reported as employed in the hosiery and knit goods industry has shown an increase at each succeeding census, the percentage which they have formed of tho total number of wage earners has decreased The percentage of females 16 years of age and over was approximately the same for 1899 and 1909, though that for 1904 was a little higher -Wage earners classified according to nature of employ~ ment,Table 6 gives for the United States the number of wage earners employed as spinners, knitters, and :finishers, respectively, in 1909 and 1904, classified according to age and sex, with similar statistics for New York and Pennsylvania for 1909 only It should be noted that the absolute :figures for the two censuses are not strictly comparable, owing to the fact that the numbers shown for 1904 are computed averages for the entire year, while those for 1909 are the numbers reported for December 15, or the nearest representative day The difference between the number of wage earners on this day and the average number for the year 1909, however, was only 7,438, or about 5 per cent of the total; and since there is little variation from month to month in the proportion of the different classes of employees, the figures representing the per cent distribution may be taken as fairly comparable -In 1909, of the 136,713 wage earners employed on December 15, or the nearest representativeday, 23 per cent were employed as spinners, 265 per cent as knitters, and 394 per cont as finishers In Pennsylvania, where, as shown by Table 21, hosiery constitutes the chief product of the industry, the distribution of the wage earners, according to occupation, is very different from that in New York, where the products are largely shirts and drawers, sweaters, cardigan jackets, etc -Among the knitters and finishers women 16 years of age and over predominate, constituting, in 1909, -635 per cent of all knitters and 811 per cent of all finishers, but of the spinners

distribution of the expenses reported for the hosiery and knit goods industry The differences among the states with respect to the proportions which the cost of materials and wages, respectively, formed of the total reported expenses are attributable largely to differences in the character of materials used and to differences in the degree of :fineness and elaboration of the products The cost of materials is likely to form a smaller proportion and -wages a higher proportion of the total expenses in establishments which do their own spinning than in establishments that buy the yarn which they use for knitting -567 In Massachusetts the mills use relatively more raw cotton and less purclrnsod cotton yarn than in Pennsylvania and Now York ENGINES, POWER, AND FUEL -tuted only 116 per cent

exceeds any other state in the horsepower of steam engines, water wheels, electric motors, and gas and other internalcombustion engines -Most of the mills in the hosiery and knit goods industry purchase the yarn which they use instet1d of spinning it themselves This is shown by the fact that in the case of cotton yarn, the principal material used in the industry, the weight of the pmchased yarn used in 1909 was more than three times as groitt as the weight of the yarn made by establishments in tho industry for thcir own use, and that the combined weight of the purchased worsted and woolen yarns used was nearly twice as great as that of such yarns made by the establishments in the industry for their o:wn use, ~though for woolen yarns alone tho quantity made 111 the establishment

goods, (3) those produch1g felt goods, and (4) those producing wool hats Estnblishments engaged primarily in mnnufocturing cnrpets and rugs have been included ir1 the woolen industry 11t previous censuses, but it was thought better in 1909to present statistics for the manufacture of carpets ai1d rugs as a separate industry It has been possible ir1 most cnses, however, to revise the statistics for prior censuses by omitting the :figures relating to the manufacture of carpets nnd rugs, so as to make them comparable with the stt1t:istics presented for 1909 The romanufrwture of :fiber from rags, tailors clippings, and all kinds of mill -It may be noted that the four branches of the woolen industry are coordinatethat is,no branch is engaged primarily in preparing materials for any other branch Within the woolen goods and worsted goods branches, however, more particularly in the latter, there is duplication in the cost of mate1∑ials and value of products by reason of the use of some of the productsprincipally yarnof certain mills as materials for other mills -In general, only the totals for the industry as a whole are shown in the tables of Volumes VIII and IX of the Thirteenth Census Reports, and it has been considered unnecessary to show separate figures for the four branches in compiling the majority of the tables of the present report -Summary for the four branches of

number of proprietors and firm members also declined from 999 in 1899 (the first census year for which :figures are available) to 732 in 1909a decrease of 267 per cent These decreases are evidently due to the steadily increasmg predominance of corporations in the industry and to the consolidation of establishments which has accompanied this movement During the decade 18991909 tl:lere was an increase of 291 per cent in the number of wage earners employed, an increase of 547 per cont in the amount of wages paid, and an increlitse of 752 per -cent in the value of products The growth of the industry, as measured by the increase in number of wage earners, primary horsepower, and vt1lu0 of products, was greater relatively during this decade than during any other covered by the table

estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -18 per cent, proprietors and officials, and 3,262, or 19 per cent, clerks, this class including other subordinate salaried employees Of the total number of persons engaged in the industry, 99,307, or 567 per cent, were m11les, and 75,869, or 433 percent, females The average number of children employed as wage earners was 9,576, or 57 per cent of all the wage earners reported for the industry In the woolen mills, 358 per cent of the wage earners were females and 33 per cent children of both sexes; in the worsted mills, 496 per cent were females and 7 per cent children; in the felt goods factories, 20,8 per cent were females and eighttenths of 1 per cent children; and in the wool hat factories 277 per cent were females and 16 per

than in others These variations among the branches explain in part the variations among the states with respect to the distribution of expenses for the industry as a whole, as shown in Table 18 -Among thti individual states, California shows the lowest proportio11 of the total rep@rtecl expenses for cost of materials (541 per cent), and Pennsylvania the highest (768 per cent); for wages the percentages ranged from 137 in Ohio to 247 in Georgia; for salaries, from 18 in New Hampshire to 112 in California; and for miscellaneous expenses, from 36 in Connecticut to 151 in Ohio -691 per cent

than in 1899796 per cent, as compared with 864 per cent Water power, also, showed a slight decrease in its proportion of the total in 1909, compared with 1904 There was an increase in the relative importance of the power of gas and other internalcombustion engines and of rented electric power A great increase also appears in the use of electric motors for the distribution of power by means of current generated in the same establish-The total quantity of wool used, on the scoured equivalent basis, decreased somewhat between 1899 and 1904, but the increase from 1904 to 1909 was sufficient to make a net increase of 37 per cent for the decade Practically all the wool used was of foreign origin, domestic wool constituting only fourtenths of 1 per cent of the total consumption of wool (in condition purchased) in 1909, 17 per cent in 1904, and twotenths of 1 per cent in 1899 Most of the wool used in the manufacture of carpets and rugs is of comparatively low grade (coarse fiber), and domestic wool, which is nearly all of medium or high grade, is chiefly used in the mills making woolen and worsted cloths -The importation of carpet wool (designated \"class 3\" in the statistics of imports and exports) in 1909 aggregated 101,876,052 pounds (See report on the woolen industry) The difference between the imports of carpet wool and the quantity reported as material by the carpet and

$71,188,152, the value of carpets and rugs alone being $66,966,338 In addition, woolen and worsted rugs to the value of $479,161 were reported as subsidiary products by establishments engaged prinmrily in the manufacture of cotton goods and of wool hats The total value of the carpets and rugs manufn,ctured in all industries was therefore $67,445,499 Table 67 shows the quantity and value of the principal products of the carpet and rug industry for 1909, 1904, and 1899 In comparing the percentages of increase in quantity with those in value, it should be remembered that each class of products includes a number of grades and styles, varying greatly in price, and that the relative quantities of these may have changed considerably from census to census Prior to the census of 1909 cn,11)ets were reported in running yards (ingrain 36 inches wide and others 27 inches wide), while rugs woven whole were reported in square yards In 1909 both carpets and rugs were reported in square yards; the figures for 1904 and 1899, therefore, have been roclucocl to square yn,rds for tho sake of comp11rt1bility The total production of c11rpots and rugs in tho industry in 1909 was 81,218,881 sqm1re yards, representing an increase of 63 per cent as compared with 1899, but a slight decrease (18 per cont) as compared with 1904 The total value of tho ettrpets and rugs produced shows an increase of 538 per cont for the docndo and an incre11se of 178 per cent for tho fiveyear period 19041909 The great decrease in the production of ingrain carpets between 1899 nnd 1909 was only partly counterbalanced by increases in other kinds of cnrpet, nnd the total production of carpets nlone shows n decrease of 11 per cent for the decade There was an increase, however, in all the principttl classes of rugs except Smyrna rugs, the total production of rugs in 1909 being nearly twice that in 1899; and rugs constituted -296 per cent of the combined output of carpets and rugs in 1909, as compared with 159 per cent in 1899 With the exception of ingrnins, which still held the lead in qum1tity in 1909, tapestry and Axminster carpets are made in the greatest quantity; in fact, the increase in tho production of Axminster carpets and rugs may be considered the leading feature of the industry for the decncle The rugs reported included only those woven whole (seamless), those woven in strips and sewed together being reported as carpet, although the inclusion of the border in the pattern of this carpet permits of its being used only in rug form In the case of body Brussels and Wilton rugs only the small sizes are woven whole -Ingrain art squares, however, are commonly woven seamless, and there is a marked tendency toward weaving tapestry, velvet, and Axminster rugs on wide looms, and the production of seamless rugs is rapidly increasing Although exact data in regard to the production of pieced rugs are not available, it is roughly estimated that the production of such

bypassing woolen, worsted, or union rags, tailors clippings, and all kinds of mill wastes through \"pickers,\" which reduce them to a fibrous form so that they can be mixed with new wool and spun into yarn Following the English custom, the term \"shoddy\" is applied to the fiber manufactured from waste yarn and soft fabrics, that made from hardspun fabrics being termed \"mungo,\" while that obtained from union or cottonmixed fabrics by carbonizing the cotton fiber with chemicals is called \"wool extract\" The shoddy mills also make considerable quantities of flocks, which consists of

period 18991904 there was an increase in the value of products of the woolen goods branch of the industry, in which shoddy is used as material to a considerable extent, this fact being reflected not only in the increase during that fiveyear period in the consumption of shoddy, as shown in the table, but in the increase in the proportion which it represented of the total consumption of scoured wool and shoddy combined Between 1904 and 1909, however, the woolen goods branch of the industry declined, while the worsted goods branch, in which shoddy is used to only a slight extent, made a phenomenal gain, with the result that the consumption of shoddy fell off from 106,584,050 pounds in 1904 to 57,823,190 pounds in 1909, or 457 per cent, while the proportion which it represented of the

during the decade 18991909, though the average number of wage earners increased 586 per cent In some cases the wool scoured is owned by the establishment and its cost is included in the cost of materials and its value in the value of products; in other cases, when the work is done under contract, the value of products represents only the amount received for work done on materials furnished by others The statistics for 1909, in particular, cover a number of cases where the raw wool was purchased, and consequently the statistics for cost of materials and value of products as reported at the different censuses are not comparable Statistics for the quantity of wool scoured by the independent establishments in 1909 are not available The total quantity of scoured wool used in the textile

censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899, is given in Table 17 The distribution of the average number by sex and age is not shown for the individual states, but Table 18 gives such a distribution for the number employed on December 15, or the -nearest representative day Female wage earners were reported from all states in which the industry was located except threeIowa, Michigan, and Mississippi -Table 4 shows the average number of wage earners in the industry distributed according to age, and in the case of those 16 years of age and over, according to sex, for 1909, 1904, and 1899 There was little change in the distribution of the employees of the industry from census to census -Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 5 gives the number of wage earners employed in the industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 for the five states in which an average of over 500 wage earners were employed during the year -1 The month of maximum employment for each state is 111dicated by boldface figures and that of minimum employment by italic figures -The largest number of wage earners employed in the industry during anymonth was29,062, in December, and the smallest number 19,394, in February, the minimum number being equal to 667 per cent of the maximum The statistics shown in Table 5 do not represent normal : conditions because of an important strike which affected a large number of establishments in Connecticut :and Now Jersey\":ïIn Connecticut the strike lasted from January 16 to the middle of June, and in New Jersey ifor a somewhat longer period In 1904 the maximum number, 22,840, was reported for September, and the :minimum number, 20,879, for May The minimum ;thus was equal to 914 per cent of the maximum, showing a much narrower range of variation than in 1909 ∑ The months of maximum and minimum employment for 1909, and the number of wage earners reported for these months, are given for the principal -according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establish~nent was classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or smaller number of hours -Most of the wage earners were employed in establish):nents where the prevailing hours were more than 48 but less than 60 There was considerable diversity a;rnong the several states in the prevailing time of employment -Character

amounting to $9,411,474 in 1909, includes t11e cost of leather bands, bindings, hat wires, and other trimmings, as well as of the cases required for packing and shipping the products -Furfelt hats or bodies and hats in the rough to the value of $806,601 were manufactured during 1909 by establishments engaged chiefly in the production of straw hats, woolen goods, and millinery and lace goods -The principal data secured by the census inquiry concerning the manufacture of furfelt hats are presented by states in Tables 17 and 18 -industry, primary horsepower, capital invested,salaries, wages, cost of materiaJs, value of products, and value -Scope of the industry,The silk manufacturing industry, according to the classification adopted for the presentation of the statistics of manufactures at the census of 1909, includes two classes of establishments, as follows: (1) Establishments manufacturing :finished silk products, such as woven fabrics, braids, and trimmings, sewing, embroidery, and wash silks, machine twist, and fringe and floss silks; and -(2) establishments manufacturing silk yarn, known technically as organzine, tram, ancl spun silk1 The concerns engaged only in the manufacture of organzine ancl tram are known as throwsters and winders, the latter performing the work of winding the threads on skeins and spools after they have been washed free from the gum which encases the raw :fibers In most cases it has not been deemed necessary to give separate statistics regarding the two branches of the industry, and except where otherwise stated the tables in this report present statistics only for the industry as a whole, The statistics for the industry do not cover the general manufacture of silk hosiery and knit goods, since establishments engaged primarily in such manufactures are included with the hosiery and knit goods industry The total value of silk hosiery and knit  underwear produced in all industries, so far as these :figures are available, is, however, presented in Table 28 Summary for the industry: 1909Table 1 presents a summary of the statistics for the silk manufacturing industry as a whole for 1909 -Few establishments include the entire process of silk manufacture in their operations, almost threefourths of the total quantity of organzine and tram reported for 1909 being thrown under contract by independent throwsters Although the establishments engaged solely in throwing, winding, etc, formed more than onefilth of the total number of establishments in the industry and employed almost one~sixth of the total number of wage eamers, they reported only 52 per cent of the total cost of materials and 65 per cent of tho total value of products This is due to the fact that the establishments operating on a commission basis did not include the value of the silk thrown, which belonged to the establishments for which the work is done, the cost of materials for the establishment throwing the -1 Orgauzine and tram constitute respectively the warp and the weit of silk fabrics, and are made from the best grades of the raw materialby the process of throwing (doubling, twisting, and winding the :filaments into yam) Spun silk

Tllble 25 -Table 2 shows another classification of the two branches of the industry, for mills manufacturing the :finished products and for plants reporting as engaged exclusively in throwing, winding, etc -The silk goods constitut:ing the final products of the industry are to a considerable extent dyed and finished in establishments included in the industry designated \"dyeing and finishing textiles,\" and a comprehensive view of the silk manufacturing industry should cover also such dyeing and finishing of silk goods in independent dyeing and :finishing establishments It is not possible, however, to give complete statistics on this subject, as the returns of the independent dyeing and finishing establishments do not in all cases indicate the kind of goods treated; of the 426 establishments included under the industry \" dyeing and finishing textiles,\" however, the returns show 69 to have been engaged primarily in the dyeing and finishing of silk goods, and the principal statistics for these establishments are summarized in Table 3 -Independentdyeing and finishing estabï lishments enï gaged primarily in dveingand finishingsilk goods -The figures for expenses for the silk manufacturing industry as a whole involve considerable duplication The figures for miscellaneous expenses shown in Table 1 include $12,008,744, representing payments for contract work, a large part of which was made to other establishments in the industry for throwing organzine and tram or dyeing and finishing silk goods for the establishments reporting the payments The establishments to which these payments were made, on the other hand, paid out the greater part of the amounts thus received for wages, materials, and other ex1)enses, thus occasioning a duplication in the total expenses reported for the industry Similarly, the establishments doing throwing or dyeing and finishing under contrn,ct reported the amounts received for this work in their value of products, while the cost of such contract work is one of the elements entering into the value of products of the establishments for which the work was done, so that a duplication thus arises in the total value of products for the industry as a whole -It is impossible to determine the exact amount of duplication arising from the causes mentioned / since no segregat10n can be made between the amounts reported as received for contract work by establishments within the industry and the receipts for work done for merchants and for establishments in other industries, and no segregation can be made between -the two classes of receipts It is believed, however, that the amounts received for contract work from concerns not engaged in the silk manufacturing industry were comparatively small, so that the total amount reported as received for contract work by establishments within the industry ($8,364,350, of which $6,745,261 was reported by throwsters or by weaving mills also doing contract throwing) would represent approximately the amount of duplication in expenses and value of products resulting from this factor, although the actual duplication might be somewhat less The difference ($3,644,394) between payments and receipts for contract work within the industry would then represent the payments for such work to establishments outside the industry -Duplication also arises in the cost of materials and value of products for this industry from the fact that some establishments within the industry sell partly manufactured products, such as organzine, tram, spun silk, and fringe and floss, to other establishments in the industry for use as materials in further manufacturing processes The value of such prodµcts is, of course, included in the value of products of the establishments reporting them, and also enters into the value of products of the establishments using them as materials, while the cost of the materials from which they were made constitutes part of the cost of materials of the establishment manufacturing them, and also enters into the cost of materials of the establishments using these products as materials for further manufacture As the total amount of this class of products reported as purchased for use as materials exceeds the amount reported as sold, the value of the latter ($15,055,625) may be assumed to -The extent to which the duplications referred to affect the value of products for the industry is brought out by Table 4, which shows the total value of products, the approximate ~mount of duplication arising from the causes mentwned, and the net value of products, eliminating the duplication -each census from 1869 to 1909, inclusive The financial :figures for 1869 are given in currency, which at that time was worth only about 80 cents, gold, to the dollar For strict comparison, therefore, these figures should be reduced about 20 per cent -Statistics for the silk manufacturing industry were first obtained at the census of 1849, when 67 establishments, employing an average of 1,723 hands, and manufacturing products valued at $1,809,476, were reported At the census of 1859, 139 establishments were reported, giving employment to an average of 5,435 hands, and manufacturing products valued at $6,607,771 The figures for 1869 include those for establishments that reported silk hose and silk knit goods as their products of chief value, while such establishments are now classified under the hosiery and knit goods industry As the business of such establishments was comparatively small in volume, this inclusion does not materially affect the comparability of the figures for the different censuses -Almost ten times as many establishments and almost :fifteen times as many wage earners wore 1∑eported for the silk manufacturing industry in 1909 as in 1869, while the value of products in the later year was more than sixteen times as great, and the value added by manufacture more than twenty times as great as that reported forty years previous The percentages of increase in the two items first mentioned were actually even greater than those based on the figures in the table, owing to the fact, already noted, that the financial :figures for 1869 were reported in a depreciated currency The greatest relative growth took placo during the first half of the period, the value of products more than trebling during the decade 18691879 and more than doubling during the following decade -The development of the industry during the decade 18991909 was much more rapid than during the preceding decade, the number of establishments -ï romparnlJle figures not nvailable s]ijgurcs not strictly comparable increasing 764 per cent, the number of wage earners -514 per cent, and the vnJue of products 836 per cent For practically every item shown in the table the increase was greater during the second half of the decade than during the first, nearly threefourths of the total increase in value of products between 1899 and 1909 taking place during the fiveyear period 19041909 In making comparisons between the value of products, cost of materials, and certain other items, as reported for the di:fferent censuses, account should be taken of the fact, already mentioned, that these items contain more or less duplication, the extent of which varled at different censuses As shown by Table 4, the duplication in value of products for 1909 was approximately $23,419,475, or 119 per cent of the tots} value of products for the industry At prior censuses the method employed in estimating duplications in cost of materials and value of products (materials -and products twice included\") differed to some extent from that by which the :figures presented in Table 4 were obtained, being as follows: -(1) The cost of organzine and tram reported as materials and the value of that reported as products were deducted from the cost of materials and value of products, respectively (2) The value of the spun silk reported as a product was deducted both from the cost of materials and the value of products (3) The cost of fringe and floss reported as materials was deducted both from the cost of materials and the value of products (4) The amount received for contract work was deducted from the value of products Table 6 shows for each census from 1889 to 1909, inclusive, the total cost of materials and value of products, as reported, the cost of materials and value of products twice included, as determined by the above method, and the net cost of materials and value of products, eliminating these duplications -The value of products in 1909, exclusive of duplications, differs somewhat from the net value of products shown in Table 4, on account of the fact that the cost of all fringe and floss purchased was treated as duplication in Table 6, instead of the value of that sold by the mills within the industry -The relative duplication in cost of materials and value of products has not varied to any great extent -at the last three censuses Betiween 1889 and 1899~ however, it appears to have deereased considerably, possibly indicating that during th1s decade there was a tendency to concentrate all the processes of manufacture in the same establishment -Summary, by states,Table 7 summarizes the more important statistics of the industry as a whole, by states, the states being arranged according to the value of products reported for 1909 Some states for which data can not be shown separately ranked higher than some nn,med in the table -The silk manufacturing industry is confined to 17 states, all of which, with the exception of California, which reported three establishments, are located east of the Mississippi River, while 16 establishments, located in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia, represent the extent of the industry in the southern states New J erscy is the most important, state in the industry, ranking :first n,t the censuses of 1909 and 1904 in value of products, with about onethird (332 per cent) of the total for the United States, and in value added by manufacture, but second at both censuses in the number of wage earners The -number of wage earners employed in the silk manufacturing industry of the state increased 254 per cent during the decade ending with 1909, and the value of products increased 637 per cent Pennsylvania, which ranked second in value of products, showed larger relative gains from 1899 to 1909 than New Jersey in all three items for which the percentages of increase are given in the table, and outranked the latter state at the censuses of 1909 and 1904 in the number of wage earners employed This latter condition is caused by the fact that many establishments in Pennsylvania are engaged in throwing raw silk into -organzine and tram for use in establishments outside the state, and since these establishments confine their operations for the most part to contract work, their value of products does not include the value of the organzine and t~am produced, but consists mainly of the amount received for work done New Jersey and Pennsylvania together reported about twothirds of the total number of wage earners and total value of products for the industry in 1909 Now York ranked third in number of wage earners, value of products, and value added by manufacture in 1909 and 1904 Rhode Island, while not an important state in the industry as measured py value of products, shows the largest percentages of increase from 1899 to 1909 of any of the states for which :figures are given in the -2703 per cent, that in value of products 2496 per cent, and that in value added by manufacture 1834 per cent In general, the states held the same or nearly the same rank in respect to number of wage earners, value of products, and value added by manufacture, in 1909 as in 1904, and all of the states had the same rank in value added by manuf actme in 1909 as in value of products -Table 8 shows, for the six leading states for 1909, the total cost of materials and value of products as reported, the amount of duplication in these items, and the cost of :mate1ials and value of products less duplications -In many inst1tnces tho partially manufactured prod∑ucts of one state go to nnother state to be completed; hence, in some states, the gross value of products may ,be a better indication of the magnitude of the industry 1than the value less products twice included rhe gross :value of the products of Pennsylvania, $62,061,302, is relatively much nenror the total value of its silk 1manufactures than the value less products twice included, $50,055,233, because a considerablo portion of the silk thrown by independent throwsters in Penn-In connection with these figures it may be noted that in 1869 children represented 208 per cent of the total number of operatives engaged in the in<lustryt most of them being employed as spinners and winders, while the census of 1909 shows a tendency to eliminate children as wage earners, most of those reported being employed in the throwing of organzine and tram -In order to compare the distribution of the persons engaged in the industry according to occupational status in 1909 with that in 1904 it is necessary to use -the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 10 -The average number of wage earners :in each state in 1909, 1904, and 1899 is given in Table 39 The distribution of the average number by sex and age is not shown for the individual states, but lable 40 gives such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, 1909, or the nearest representative day Female wage earners were reported from all the states in which the industry was carried on, and in every case exceeded the males in number The largest number, 25,9401 or 405 per cent of the total for the industry in the United States, was reported for Pennsylvania, and the next largest number, 17,316, for New Jersey The four leading states, as measured by value of products, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, and Connecticut, together employed 56,636 female wage earners, or almost ninetenths (884 per cent) of the total number for the United States Wage earners under 16 years of age were reported from 15 states; the largest number, 5,140, were in Pennsylvania, in which state they represented 138 per cent of the total number of wage earners in the industry 0£ the states shown in Table 40, the proportion of children employed was highest in Maryland, where they represented 282 per -cent of the total number of wage earners in the industry, and lowest in New York, where they constituted 25 per cent -Wage earners classified according to nature of em~ ploymentTable 12 shows for the United States as a whole for 1909 and 1904, and for selected states for 19091 the distribution by age, and in the case of those 16 years of age and over by sex also, of spinners, weavers, and all other wage earners It should be noted that the absolute figures for the two censuses are not strictly comparable, owing to the fact that the numbers shown for 1904 are computed averages for the entire year, while those for 1909 are the numbers reported for December 15, or the nearest representative day The difference between the number of wage earners on this day and the average number for the year 1909, however, was bnly 3,332, or 33 per cent of the total; and since there is little variation in the proportion of the different classes of employees, the figures representing the per cent distribution may be taken as fairly comparable -While the number of weavers increased between 1904 and 1909, there was a decrease in the proportion which they represented of the total number of wage earners employed Female weavers outnumbered the males in the weaving of broad sillrn, while in the weaving of ribbons, velvets, and plushes, men predominated -The relative number of spinners and weavers varied considerably in the different states In only one of the five states shown separately in the table (New Jersey) did the number of weavers exceed the number of spinners In Massachusetts, 587 per cent of the wage earners were spinners, while in Connecticut such operators constituted only 328 per cent of the total Of the total male wage earners 16 years of age or over in 1909, somewhat more than onehalf (53 per cent) were weavers and about onethird (311 per cent) spinners, the proportion of weavers having decreased somewhat during the decade 18991909, while the proportion of spinners increased slightly In the case of women wage earners, the proportions are practically reversed, about onethird (333 per cent) of the total munber being weavers and more than onehalf (549 per cent) spinners; comparatively little change in the percentages took place during the decade Or the children somewhat more than threefourths (793 per cent) were spinners -womm1, nnd children, respectively, in the total number or wagn ouruors tincl in each of tho three classes for whieh stntistins are presented in Table 12 -Nearly twothirds (646 per cent) of the spinners reported for the United States as a whole in 1909 were women, the proportion being approximately the same at each of the two peceding censuses Women were in the majority in this class of wage earners in each of the states shown in the table, the percentage which they formed of the total ranging from 604 in Massachusetts to 783 in Connecticut The weavers were almost equally divided between adults of the two sexes; in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, however, more than half of the weavers were women, the proportions being -596 per cent and 562 per cent, respectively, as compared with 414 per cent in Connecticut Women formed a somewhat larger proportion of the total number of weavers in the industry in 1909 than in 1899, although there was a slight decrease in the percentages between 1904 and 1909 Of the wage earners included under the head of\" All other\" in 1909, over onehalf were women Children are of importance only among the spinners, of whom they formed about oneeighth (13 per cent) in 1909; this relatively high percentage was, however, mainly due to conditions in Pennsylvania, where about onefifth (204 per cent) of the spinners were children, this class in fact outnumbering the adult males reported as spinners, and in Massachusetts, where the proportion was 156 per cent; in the other states shown in the table the proportion of children among the spinners was small Children formed a somewhat smaller proportion of the total number of spinners in the industry in 1909 than in either 1904 or 1899 -Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 14 gives the number of wage earners employed in the silk manufacturing industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 for nine of the leading states in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed during the year -1 Tho month of maximum employment for each state is indicated by holdface figures and that of minimum employment by italic figures -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 15 the wage earners in the silk manufacturing industry have been classified according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or smaller number of hours -Nearly all (952 per cent) of the wage earners employed in the silk manufacturing industry in 1909 were in mills where the prevailing hours exceeded 54 -per week, the great majority, 822 per cent of the total, being employed in establishments where the prevailing hours were between 54 and 60 per week This was the most common working time, likewise, in all but two of the individual states for which :figures are given in Table 15 In Maryland, however, all the wage earners, and in North Carolina the majority, were employed in establishments operating 60 hours -Table 16 presents statistics with respect to the character of ownership of tho establishments in the silk manufacturing industry -1 Includes ono ∞1tnblM1mont undor

approximately the same percentage of the total number, the value of products of the establishments under the latter form of ownership was more than twice a<s great as that of establishments under

total expenses represented by the different items naturally vary in the several states The differences are very largely due to differences in the extent to which the organzine and tram used is made within the state or purchased from outside the state and in the relative importance of establislunents engaged solely in throwing -The total primary power used in the silk mills increased from 57,397 horsepower in 1899 to 97,947 horsepower in i909, or 706 per cent By far the greater part of the power used in the industry is steam power; the proportion which such power formed of the total primary power, however, decreased from -801 per cent in 1899 to 736 per cent in 1909, although there was a considerable absolute increase during the decade in the amount of steam power employed Water power, also, which formed 116 per cent of the total primary power in 1899, shows a steady decrease in the proportion which it formed of the total, in spite of an increase in amount, constituting only 85 per cent of the total in 1909 The horsepower of electric motors operated by purchased current (rented electric power) increased from 609 in 1899 to 10,354 in 1909, and at the last census was second in importance to steam power, representing 106 per cent of the total \\x0cTHE SILK INDUSTRY -lhe number and horsepower of electric motors used for distributing power by means of current generated in the establishment show a very largo increase, the horsepower of such motors having more than trebled during the decade -Table 21 shows, for 1909, the amount of the several kinds of power and of the different kinds of fuel used in nine of the leading states in the industry -In 1909 Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York together reported 75,448 horsepower, or 77 per cent of the aggregate for the industry Steam power was the most important form of power in all of the states shown separately except Massachusetts and Virginia, where water power was used to a greater extent than any other form of power The largest amount of steam power, 37,410 horsepower, is shown for Pennsylvania; the largest amount of water power, 2,001 horsepower, for Massachusetts; and the largest amount of rented electric power, 2,960 horsepower, for Pennsylvania The rented power included under the head of\" Other,\" which is particularly large in New Jersey, is chiefly power supplied by shafts or belts to small mills -Fuel consumedAnthracite coal was the principal class of fuel used, 242,771 long tons being consumed during 1909 Bituminous coal was next in impor-tance, 155,256 short tons being consumed Gas was also used to a considerable extent, the greatest quantity being reported for New York  -Attention is called to the fact that the statistics for raw silk shown in Table 22 do not represent the total amount of this material used in the industry More than twothirds of the raw silk used was thrown on contract, either for silk merchants or for weaving mills, and as this silk was not owned by the mills doing the throwing, its amount and value were not included by them in their report as to materials used The silk thrown for the weaving mills, however, formed part of the materials reported by such mills and accordingly is included in the table, but that thrown for merchants, not being owned by silk manufacturing concerns, was not reported and so is not included in the statistics for the industry It is impossible to give the amount of silk so thrown, but the quantity must have been considerable Silk thrown for merchants and later sold by -them as organzine and tram to establishments within the silk industry does not figure in the statistics of materials as raw silk, but as organzine or tram only -The reported cost of raw silk represented 629 per cent of the total cost of all materials used, while that of organzine and tram, purchased as such, represented -ï Not including waste, nails, and pierced cocoo11s Silk in its various forms constituted about threefilths of the total weight of textile materials used in 1909, and yarns other than silk about twofilths The quantity of raw silk used in theïindustry shows an increase of 79 per cent during the decade and its cost an increase of 665 per cent The increase in the amount of yarns other than silk used was much greater than that in the silk used, thus indicating a tendency toward the manufacture of silk mixed goods The amount of cotton yarn other than mercerized used in 1909 was nearly twice as great as in 1899, and that of mercerized cotton yarns, the consumption of which in 1899 was comparatively small, nearly seven times as great, while considerable increases are also shown for mohoir and for woolen or worsted yarns -The amount of spun silk purchased shows an increase of only 363 per cent for the decade, a smaller increase relatively than in any other material shown separately in Table 22 The quantity purchased exceeded the quantity reported as sold (see Table 27) by 1,333,510 pounds in 1909, 1,380,672 pounds in 1904, and 1,112,832 pounds in 1899 A large part of this material is imported, the total quantity brought into the country during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1909, being 2,343,576 pounds Spun silk is used principally in the manufacture of silkmixed goods, although large quantities are used in the cotton goods and woolen industries and in the manufacture of hosiery and knit goods The spun silk manufactured in the United States is made, to a great extent, from the -waste which result from the various processes of manufacture carried on in the silk mills, together with imported wild silk and pierced cocoons -Owing to the high price of silk and to its limited supply, great efforts have been made to secure satidfactory substitutes As a result, a number of processes have been invented for making :fibers closely resembling animal silk The production of artificial silk is largely confined to Germanyand France, but a number of other countries have mills devoted to its manufacture Although the establishments in the United States have scarcely passed the experimental stage there is promise of a large output in this country The silk mills of the United States used 914,494 pounds of artificial silk in 1909, as compared∑ with 466,151 pounds in 1904, and 6,056 pounds in 1899 This material is used principally in the manufacture of braids and fringes, dress trimmings, millinery trimrnings, etc -Consumption of silk in other textile industliesIn addition to the silk used in the silk manufacturing industry, considerable amounts were used in other textile industries in the manufacture of goods of mixed fibers and of silk hosiery and silk knit goods, and also in the electrical industry for covering wire, for which data in regard to consumption is not available lable 25 shows the quantity of reeled and spun silk yarns used in the United States in textile industries other than the silk manufacturing industry for 1909, 1904, and 1899 -The quantity of silk used in other textile industries in 1909 was more than three times as large as in 1899 -The amounts used in hosiery and lmit goods and cotton manufactures each show an increase of about 270 per cent; the quantity used in wool manufactures, however, shows an increase of less than 50 per cent In cotton manufactures silk is used exclusively in the manufacture of fancy woven fabrics with silk stripes or :figures The statistics for 1909 show the remarkable increase in the production of silk hosiery from 12,572 dozen pairs in 1899 and 42,065 dozen pairs in 1904 to 434,414 dozen pairs in 1909, and this accounts for most of the increase shown for the hosiery and knit goods industry -on chiefly in establishments which used the organzme and tram in further processes of manufacture The practice on the part of weaving mills of having the silk tluown under contract in establishments whose activities are limited to this work, has, however, been growing mpidly Table 26 shows, by states,  the quantity of raw silk thrown under contracli mto organzine and tram in 1909, 1904, and 1899 -silk used in the industry which was thrown under contract in the respective years, owing to the fact that the silk reported as thrown under contract includes that thrown for merchants and others not in the silk manufacturing industry, they are sufficiently close to give a general idea of the relative extent of commission throwing and of the increase in the relative importance of such throwing during the decade covered by the table -ImportsSilk mills depend upon imports for their raw silk material Table 27 shows the

of the total production m 1909 and contributing 626 per cent of the total value; of the total output of these fabrics, allsilk -goods represented 768 per cent Piecedyed broad silks ranked next in importance, representing 322 per cent of the total output of broad silks and contributing -251 per cent of the total value; about twothirds (67 per cent) of the total production of piooedyed goods consisted of silkmixed fal,rics The output of Jacquard broad silks, of whi<ih somewhat more than twothirds (687 per cent) consisted of allsilk goods, was much less than that of the other two classes, representing lOA per cent of the total production of broad silks and contributing 123 per cent of the total vtilue Each class of broad silk shows a considerable in~rease for the decade as a whole, the largest relative increase being in the case of silkmixed piecedyed broad silks, the output of which in 1909 was nearly five times as great as in 1899 The production of allsilk piecedyed broad silks

cotton The hard fibers are those that form a structural part of the leaf of the plants fromwhich they are derived and ~nclude manila hemp, sisal, Ncw Zealand hemp, and 1stle or taropico fiber The soft fibers include those found within the stem of the plant from which they are derived, such as true hemp, flax, and jute In aclclition to the long, clean fibers of flax, hemp, and jute, there are used short and otherwise imperfect fibers of the same plants In the case of flax and hemp these are called \"tow,\" and in the case of jute they are known as \"butts\" or \"rejections\" -Sisal and manila hemp constituted 951 per cont of the total quantity of hard fibers used in 1909, and 977 in 1899 Jute and jute butts combined constituted -848 per cent of the total quantity of soft fibers used in 1909, as compared with 829 per cent of that used in 1899 Of the materials shown separately in the table,  other\" hard fibers show the largest percentage of increase in quantity (1715), while cotton shows the largest relative increase in cost (2441 per cont) -ProduotsIablo 18 shows the quantity and value of the principal products of the industry as a whole for 1909 and 1899 -2 In addition, cordage and twino and juto and linon goods to tho vnluo of $890,629 wore made by ostablisbmonts engaged primarily ju tho manufacture of productsother than those covered by the industry deslgmitwn -At the census of 1909 two estnblishmenttJ reported the manufacture of ropo, and ono the manufacture of linen thread, on contract, from material furnished by the parties for whom the work Wtts clone Tho total production of the three estab1ishmcmts, howover, did not exceed 4,500,000 pounds -Separate statistics for linen toweling and for other linen woven goods can not l>e given without disclosing the operntions of individual establishments, and their total value is incluclecl in the amount shown for \"all other products\" in Table 18 Both of these products, however, show a decided increase between 1899 and 1909 -The principal statistics seculod by the consus }11quiry concerning the industry as ti whole ttro prosontcd by states in Table 19, showing, for HlO\\\\), tho number of -establishments, number of persons engaged in the industry, primary l10rsepower, capital, salaries, wages, vnJuo of products, and value added by manufacture -Scope of the industryThe census classification dyeing and :finishing textiles\" includes all estnblishments engaged primarily in the dyeing and :finishing of textiles It covers the bleaching, dyeing, and mer0erizing of raw :fibers, ond of yarns and woven cloth, and the printing of piece goods, and olso includes establishments engaged in tho beaming and winding 0f yarns and in the spooling of thread, as well 11s a few establishments engoged in dyeing and bleaching straw braids Although some establishments make a spedalty of dyeing and finishing silk yarns and fabrics, and a number specialize in work on other classes of textiles, so large a number dye and finish more than one variety of fabric that it is impossible to compile statistics which will correctly represent tho work done on any particular class -A considern,blo number of the cotton, silk, and woolen mills carry on, in tho same establishment, 0110 0r more of these subordi1rnte processes in connection with tho manufacture of textiles, and where practicable, separate returns wore secured for tho dyeing and finishing depnrtments of such mills, in which case these departments wore treated as separate establishmonts and the statistics concerning them wore included in the present report on the dyeing and fmishing industry Most of these mills, however, made no separate report -for the operations of the dyeing and :finishing department, such statistics being included with those for the entire establishment in a single report The statistics for the dyeing and finishing industry, therefore, do not fully cover the dyeing and :finishing operations carried on in connection with the textile industries -Comparison with earlier oensusesStatistics for the dyeing and finishing industry were :first obtained at the census of 1849, when 42 establishments were reported, giving employment to an average of 4,080 hands The returns for cost of materials and value of products included the value of the cloth treated and are therefore not comparable with those for later censuses, but the value added by manufacture was $3,218,761 At the census o:f 1859 there were 29 establishments engaged in the industry, giving employment to an average of 4,005 hands and reporting products to the value of $7,971)064; the value added by manufacture was $4,086,249 At the census of 1869, 42 establishments, employing an average of 8,894 hands, were reported; tho value of the cloth treated was included with the value of products at this census also, but the value added by manufacture amounted to $8,0721686 -1 A minus sign () (lenotes decrease Where the percentages are omitted, compnrablc figures can not be gtveu-ï Comparable figures not available The number of independent clyeing and finishing establishments shows n, considerable increase for each of the intercensal periods covered by the tn,ble, the number in 1909 being more than twice that in 1879 -due to the fact that competition and improved processes had reduced the rates charged for work done1 The value of products in 1909 was more than two and onehalf times that in 1879 Between 1899 and 1909 the average number of wage earners increased 14,270, or 479 per cent, and the vn1ue of products $38,593,101, or 858 per cent, the greater part of these increases taking place during the second half of the decade In general the cost of materials consists chiefly of the amount e~pended for dyestuffs and other chemicals used, and the value of products represents the amount which is charged for performing the dyeing and finishing processes, the goods dyed or :finished in most instances belonging to other concerns; but in some instances the goods dyed or :finished are owned by the establishments which perform these final operations and under such circumstances the cost of the fabric is included in the cost of materials while the value of the finished cloth is included in the value of products The large increases in cost of materials and value of products shown for the fiveyear period 19041909, therefore, may be due in part to the fact that a larger proportion of the value of the fabrics treated was included in the cost of materials in 1909 than in 1904 -Summary, by statesTable 2 summarizes the more important statistics of the industry by states, the states being arranged according to the value of products reported for 1909 The states shown in this table are given their actual ranking among all states, the rank of certain states for which :figures can not be presented being higher than that of some named in the table The extent to which the establishments in the several states owned the materials upon which they worked greatly influences their rank in value of products, and no doubt largely accounts for the seeming discrepancy between the proportion of the total value of products contributed by certain states as compared with the proportion which the same states contributed of the total number of wage earners, or the value added by manufacture -In 1909 Massachusetts ranked first in respect to value of products, reporting 262 per cent of the total for the industry in the United States, and in value added by manufacture, but was second in average number of wage earners, New Jersey ranking first in this respect The number of wage earners employed in the industry in Massachusetts increased 941 per cent during the decade ending with 1909, and the value of products 1469 per cent In 1909 New Jersey ranked second in value of products and value added by manufacture, having dropped from first place since -1904 Rhode Island ranked third in value of products and in value added by manufacture in both 1909 and 1904, and third in number of wage earners in 1909, having changed places with Massachusetts since 1904 Of the states for which tho percentages of increase are given in the table, New York shows tho largest relative gain from 1899 to 1909 in value of products and value added by manufacture, the increases being -1668 per cent and 1488 per cont, respectively; Massachusetts, however, shows the largest percentage of increase in number of wago earners, \\x0cTHE DYEING AND FINISHING OF TEXTILES -Persons engaged in the industryTable 3 shows, for 1909, the number of persons engaged in the industry, classified according to occupational status and sex and in the case of wage earners according to age als; It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -931 per cent, were wage earners; 1,218, or 26 per cent, proprietors and officials; n,nd 2,039, or 43 per cent, dorks, this class including othor subordinate salaried employees Of the total number of persons engaged in the industry, 816 per cont wore males and 184 per cent females Over nin0tontl1s (946 per cont) of the females were wage eamors Of tho 1,0,14 children under 16 years of ago employed as wage earners, 708 per cent wore males and 292 per cent females Tho average number of wage earners employed in the industry in 1909, 1904, and 1899 is given for each statein Table 14 Tho distribution of the average mnnber by sex and ago is not shown for tho individual states, but Tttble 15 gives such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, or tho nearest representative clay Femalo wage earners were reported from 11,ll of tho 10 states shown in the table The largest number, 2,222 was reported from Massachusetts, and the next largest number,1,646, from New York ∑ -In order to compare tho distribution of tho persons engaged in tho industry in 1909 n,ccording the occupational status with tlrn,t in 1904, it is nocossary to use the classificn,tion employed at the oa,rlior census -The absolute number of males and females 16 years of age and over increased during each of the two :fiveyear periods covered by the table, but the number of children under 16 years of age, though larger in 1904 than in 1899, was less in 1909 than in either 1904 or 1899 Tho mnnber of women employed as wage earners increased 868 per cent during the decade 18991909, and tho proportion which they represented of the total number also increased appreciably The proportion of males 16 years of age or over and of children under 16 years of age declined during the decade -Wage earners employed, by months,Table 6 gives the number of wage earners employed in the industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during Hl09 for each state in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed during the year, and for which statistics can be given without disc]osing individual operations -1Thom~nth of maximnm0~1~lllent for each state is inclicatod by boldfuce figuros and that of m1n1mum employment by italic figures, -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 7 the wage earners in the industry have been classified according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or smaller number of hours -Over ninetenths (964 per cent) of the wage earners in the industry were employed in establishments where the prevailing number of hours was more than 54 per week Almost twothirds (64 per cent) of the total number worked in establishments where the prevailing -hours were between 54 and 60 per week, while somewhat more than onefourth (287 per cent) were in establishments where they were 60 per week In six of the states for which figures are given in the table, the most common working time was between 54 and 60 hours; in Connecticut, Maine, and Pemisylvania, however, the largest number of wage earners were employed in establishments where the prevailing hours were 60 per week Only 3 7 per cent of the total number of wage earners in the industry were in establishments where the prevailing number of hours, of employment per week exceeded 60, and only 36 per cent in establishments where it was as low as 54 -Character of ownershipTable 8 presents statistics with respect to the character of ownership of the rlyeing and finishing establishments -1 Includes two establishments under \"other\" 01vnership, to avoid disclosure or individual operations, ï -In 1909, of the total number of establishments reported, 502 per cent were under corporate ownership, as compared with 453 per cent in 1904; the value of the products of these establishments represented 865 per cent of the total value of products for all establishments engaged in the industry in 1909 and 82 per cent in 1904 -Table 9 gives statistics for establishments classified according to form of ownership in the five leading states -There was considerable variation among the states in t,he relative importance of the establishments operated by individ1:11ls, firms, and corporations, _respectively Thus, m Massachusetts, the leading state in the industry, establishments controlled by corporations constituted almost threefourths of the total number of establishments, gave employment to -939 per cent of the wage earners, and reported 957 per cent of the total value of products The proportions for Connecticut, where 8 out of 10 establishments were under corporate ownership, were very high also, but the percentages can not be given without disclosing individual operations In Pennsylvania, on the other hand, corporations controlled only 274 per cent of the establishments, but these establishments gave employment to 668 per cent of the wage earners, and contributed 711 per cent of the total value of products Size of establishmentsTable 10 presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for the establishments in the industry grouped according to the value of their products -47 per cent, reported products valued at $1,000,000 or over In 1904 there were 9 establishments of this class out of a total of 360 While such establishments represented an insignificant proportion of the total number at both censuses, they reported a considerable proportion of the total value of products446 per cent in 1909 and 25 4 per cent in 1904 The increase in the value of products for this class of establishments represented 746 per cent of the total for the entire industry On the other hand, the small establishmentsthat is, th~se having products valued at Jess than $20,000const1tuted 298 per cent of the total number of establishments, but the value of their products represented only 14 per cent of the total The great bulk of the value of products of the :industry was reported by establishments having products valued at $100J000 or over, such establishments reporting 894 per cent of the total value in 1909 ancl 849 per cent in 1904 -Table 11 classifies the establishments in the industry by states, according to the number of wage earners employed -42 per cent were reported by the establishments employing from 1 to 20 wage earners; 13 per cent by those employing from 21 to 100; 152 per cent by those employing from 101 to 250; and 676 per cent by those employing more than 250 Six establishments employed more than 1,000 wage earners, the number of wage earners in these establishments forming 178 per cent of the total for the industry -ExpensesAs stated in the Introduction, the census figures representing expenses do not purport to to show the total cost of manufacture, since they take no account of interest or depreciation; hence they can not properly he used for calculating profits Facts of -increase in the horsepo ∑∑ er of electric motors operated by purchased cunent (rented ~lectric power) The number and horsepower of electric motors used for dis tributing power by means of current generated in the establishments in the industry show a very decided increase, the horsepower of such motors in 1909 amounting to 21,346, as compared with only 1,949 10 years earlier -was reported for Massachusotts, the largest amount of water power for Connecticut, and tho largest amount of rented electric power for New York -Fuel consnmedBituminous coal Wi1S the principal class of fuel used, 869,216 short tons being consumed in 1909 The largest quantity of anthracite coal, 304,610 long tons, or more than onehalf of the total for the industry, was reported for New Jersey -The principal statistics secured by the census inquiry concerning the dyeing and :finishing of textiles are presented, by states, in Tables 14 and 15 -industry, primary horsepower, capital invested, salaries, wages, cost of materials, value of products, and value added by manufacture Table 15 gives the statistics of the industry for 1909 in somewhat greater detail -Scope of the industryThis industry embraces establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of floor coverings of oilcloth and linoleum (including cork carpet) and of enameled oilcloth, including table, shelf, and upholsters oilcloth, etc Some of the establishments in the industry also manufn,cture buckram and burlap wall coverings, which are included under \"all other products\" in Table 9 Establishments which manufacture opaque window shade cloth, however, are not included The report also takes cognizance of establishments manufacturing artificial leather (included with \"upholstering materials\" in 1909), to the extent of including in Table 9, but not elsewhere, statistics of the quantity and value of this product, which is closely allied to oilcloth and linoleum in composition -In reports of previous censuses the statistics for the industry have been 1rnblished separately under two classifications, \"oilcloth, enameled,\" and \"oilcloth and linoleum, floor,\" but t1t the present census, because of the overbpping of the statistics, the two classifications have been combined under the designation \"oilcloth and linoleum\" -Summary for the two branches of the industryTable 1 presents stn,tistics for tho oilcloth and linoleum -The oilcloth and linoleum branch of the industry contributed 678 per cent of the total value of products reported for the industry as a whole and 727 per cent of the value added by manufacture Of the total number of wage earners, 812 lJer cent were reported by the floor oilcloth and linoleum branch -Comparison with earlier censusesTable 2 summarizes the statistics for the manufacture of oilcloth and linoleum as reported at each census from 1869 to 1909, inclusive The :financial :figures for 1869 are given in currency, which at that time was worth only about 80 cents, gold, to the dollar For strict comparison, therefore, these :figures should be reduced n,bout 20 per cent -1 A minus sign () denotes decrease Where percentages are omitted comparnlile figures are not available, , Comparable figures not availnblo a l!lguros not striotly

several of the principal items shown Th~ value of products for 1909 was more than five times that in 1869, ancl the -number of wage c!Lrners increased 2686 per cent between those years lhe value of products and cost of materials more than doubled during the decade 18991909, the percentage of increase in each case being slightly less than during the preceding decade The number of wage earners increased 61 per cent and the amount paid in wages 735 per cent from 1899 to 1909 Salaried employees were included to some extent with wage earners at the earlier censuses, and comparative figures for this class, therefore) arc not shown for censuses prior to that of 1899 -Summary, by statesDetailed statistics for 1909 are given for each state in the industry in Table 11, so far as figures can be presented without disclosing individual operations New Jersey was the leading state in the industry in 1909, reporting 408 per cent of the total number of wage earners and 435 per cent of∑ the total value of products Pennsylvania ranked second in value of products; figures for this state can not be given, however, without disclosingindivid ualoperations New York ranked third in value of products in 1909, reporting 151 per cent of the total value of products and 212 per cent of the total number of wage earners -Persons engaged in the industryTable 3 shows, for 1909, the number of persons engaged in the industry classified according to occupational status and sex, and in the case of wage earners, according to age also It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described -in the Introduction Table 3 CLASS AU classes Proprletors and ofllolals          Proprietors and firm members

average number of persons e11gaged in the industry during 1909 was 5,557, of whom 936 per cent were wage earners, 2 per cent proprietors and officials, and 44 per cent clerks, this class including other subordinate salaried employees Of the total number of persons engaged in the industry, 5,345, or 962 per cent, were males The number of children reported as wage earners was only 4 7 -Wage

-Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 6 the wage earners in the oilcloth and linoleum industry have been classified according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or smaller number of hours -Character of ownershipIable 7 presents statistics with respect to the charncter of ownership of the

expenses do not purport to show the total cost of manufacture, since they take no account of interest or depreciation; hence they can not properly be used for determining profits, Facts of interest can be brought out, however, concerning the relative importance o:f the different classes of expenses which were reported Table 2 shows the total expenses in the oilcloth and linoleum fodustry in 1909 to have been $20,860,264, distributed as fol-Summary for the United Stateslable 9 shows the quantity and value of the different kinds of oilcloth and linoleum manufactured in 1909 and 1904 by establishments in the industry, and also the quantity and value of the artificial leather produced in 1909 -1 In addition products to tho value of $33,328 were reported by establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of yroducts other than those covered by the IndusLry desi6!lation Tho production o artificial leather is included under \"upïholstering materials\" in tho general reports -ï Figures not available Each of tho varieties of oilcloth and linoleum shows a considerable percentage of increase in quantity and value except floor oilcloth, the output of which decreased 145 per cent in quantity, although its value increased 59 per cent The decrease in the output of floor oilcloth is explained by the increased degree to which linoleum has been substituted for it as a :floor covering Inlaid linoleum shows the largest percentages of gain of any of the products of the industry during the fiveyear period, 1098 per cent in output and 171 per cent in value The output of table oilcloth, the most important of the oilcloth products in 1909, increased 609 per cent and its value 593 per cent between 1904 and 1909 -Floor oilcloth, which was the principal kind of oilcloth manufactured in 1904, representing 412 per cent of the total value of oilcloth produced, contributed only 323 per cent of the total value in !909 The proportion of the total value represented by table oilcloth, on the other hand, increased from 409 per cent in 1904 to 483 per cent in 1909, and the proportion represented by enameled oilcloth from 178 per cent in the earlier year to 194 per cent in the later year -The manufacture of artificial leather is so closely allied to the oilcloth industry that the quantity and value of this product has been included for 1909 in the preceding table The total value of products as shown in Table 9 is not comparable with the total for 1904, since the value of artificial leather was not included at the former census Artificial leather, although used to some ∑extent in bookbinding, is used principally in the upholstering trade, and the reports forthe manufacture of this product were included with those for the industry designated \"upholstering materials\" in the general census reports of 1909 -A detailed statement of the different products can not be given for any individual state except New Jersey without disclosing the operations of individual establishments New Jersey was the leading state in the industry both in 1909 and 1904 The total value of products of the oilcloth and linoleum industry, including artificial leather, for this state in 1909 was $11,519,680, which constituted 439 per cent of the total value for the United States Linoleum represented more than half (575 per cent) of the total value of the products of the industry for the state, its value, $5,834,338, being 538 per cent of the total value of linoleum for the United States Of the total value of the different varieties of linoleum manufactured by the establishments in New Jersey in 1909, inlaid linoleum constituted 225 per cent and linoleum, includ~ ing cork carpet,\" 775 per cent The proportion which the value of the different varieties of oilcloth constituted of the total value of ∑oilcloth produced in the state was as follows: Floor oilcloth, 344 per cent; enameled oilcloth, 282 per cent; and table oilcloth, -374 per cent The value of artificial leather manufactured in New Jersey in 1909 was $1,377,084, or 399 per cent of the total for the United States Exports and importsTable 10 gives the amount and value of the imports and thQ value of the exports of oilcloth and linoleum from 1898 to 1910, inclusive, as compiled from the reports of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, Dep3:rtment of Commerce -The statistics of imports and exports in the reports of tho Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce do not make a clear distinction between cotton oilcloth and other cotton cloths; therefore, only the imports of floor oilcloth and linoleum are included in Table 10 The e:x:ports, however, include the statistics for all classes of oilcloth -The value of the exports of oilcloths has also increased with each successive year, with the single exception that there was a decrease in 1909 as compared with 1908 -value of products, and value added by manufacture OILOLOTB: AND LINOLEUMDETAILED STATISTICS, BY STATES: 1909 -Relationship of the Industrieslho present leport embraces statistics for four elnsses of estnhlishmentsnarnely, blast furnaces, steel works and rolling mills, wiredrawing establishments, and tinplate and temoplate dipping establishmentswhich are treated by the Census Bureau as belonging to separate industries These industries are considered together beeause of their intimate relation to one another The blast furnaces supply material for the steel works and rolling mills, and these in turn furnish tho material for the tinplate and wire industries In fn,ct, two or more different branches of rniinufactme n,re frequently carried on in establishments under tho same ownership and in the same plant -The fact thnt two or more of those industries are frequently conducted in tt single plant renders the presentation of sepiwittl\\\\ stn,tistics for the industries very clifiicult In order to bring out us clearly as possible the relative importimcc of the different industries, the Census Bureau has secured separate reports for the blast furnaces and for the tinplate and terneplato dipping business, even when these arc assoïciated with steel works lmd rolling mills It was found impossible to make n, complete segregation of the statistics for the wire depnrtn:1ents of stool works and rolling mills -To state the matter somowlrnt more in dotnil, tho bulk of the pig iron produced by the blast fumaces of the country is converted into stool and the steel fabricated into rolled forms in the snme industrial plant, although, of course, there 11,rc somo concerns which operate only blast furnn,ces nrnl some which operate only steel works and rolling mills Where the two branches of business are combined, separate reports are secured for the blastfurnace dcptwtment, on the one hnnd, and the steelworks 1md rollingmill department on the other hand Each department is called an \"estn,blislnnont\" A tmnsfor value is assigned to the pig iron dolivorecl to the steel works, and this transfer vn1uo appears ns p111t of the value of products of the blastfurnaco \"ostiiblishment\" and as part of the cost of matorittls of the steelworks and rollingmill establishment , Again, the bulk of the business of clipping tin plate and terncplnte is conducted in depnrtments of lolling mills which produce tho bl11ek pltitos, thore being comparatively few independent clipping establishments w~ich buy their black plntes Nevertheless, the dippmg departments of rolling mills arc treated as separate establishments by tho Census Bureau lhe sta-tistics for the blackplate rolling mills exclusive of the clip~in~ departments, are included ~ith the general stnt1st1cs for steel works and rolling mills, although in the special report on the tinplate and terneplate industry separate statistics for blackplate mills are also presented The black plates transferred to the dipping departments are assigned a value which appears as part of the value of products of the rollingmill industry and in turn as part of the cost of materials -Finally, l1 very considerable proportion of the wire produced in the country is drawn in the wire departments of iron and steel rolling mills and of ln∑ass and copper rolling mills, the latte1∑ mills being assigned to the industry \"brass and bronze products\" lhe rolling mills produce the wire rods and turn them over to the wire departments for drawing It was found impossible, however, to segregate the statistics in detail !or the wire departments of rolling mills; consequently, m most tables of the census reports the statistics given for tho \"wire\" industry represent only the business of wiredrawing establishments which purchase the wire rods, and therefore by no means fully cover the wire industry in the broad and true sense In Part Vthe section devoted to the wire industryin this report, however, such statistics as are available regarding the wire industry as a whole nre presented In the stntistics for steel works and rolling mills the entire value of the wire nnd wire products made by such mills appears as part of the vnlue of products of the industry -Duplication in value of products and cost of materialsIt is evident from what has been said that to add together the values of products as shown for the blastfurnace industry, the steel works and rolling mills, the wire industry, and the ti11plate and terneplate dipping industry woukl give a total having noparticular significance, because of the great duplication clue to the use of the products of one establishment as materials for another estnblishment in the group It may be noted that there is not only duplication as among the four industries distinguished by the Census Bmeau, but also considerable duplication within the single industry designated as \"steel works and rolling mills\" -The following table shows a,t least approximtitely the extent of the duplication in the value of products, and the net value of the products of the four industries combined, exclusive of such duplication Although for convenience in calculation the amount of duplication is given in exact :figures, it should not be understood that -these figures are absolutely complete and correct The fast column shows the approximate value of the products of each industry which were produced for sale to establishments outside of this group of four industries For example, the blast furnaces turned out in 1909 products (practically all pig iron) valued at $391,429,283 Of this total, however, products to the value of over $297,000,000 were for consumption in the steel works and rolling mills, while nearly $94,000,000 worth of products of the blast furnaces were for use in other industries, the foundry and machineshop industry being the most important consumer -The net value of the products of this group of four industries in 1909 was in the neighborhood of a billion dollars This is not to be confused with the value added to materials by manufacturethat is, the value of products less the cost of all materialswhich for the four industries combined amounted to $429,036,870 -The last column in the above table should not, of course, he taken as indicating at all the relative importance of the four branches of industry; nor, on the other hand, can the column showing gross value of products be taken as indicating such relative importance The only available statistics tending to show the relative importance of the four industries are those of the average number of wage earners and of the value added to materials by manufacture Such statistics are presented in Table 2 -It will be seen from this table that the number of wage earners employed in the blast furnaces is very much less than the number employed in the steel works and rolling mills, and also tl111t very much less value is added to materials by manufacture in the former industry than in the latter Immensely important as is pig iron in the iron and steel industry, the greater part of the value of pig iron is not produced by blast furnaces but is represented by the ore and fuel So, too, the tinplate plants perform relatively simple processes upon the materials which they obtain from the rolling mills, so that the number of waOe earners and the value added to materials by manufa~ture for this industry is small in proportion to the value of the output The same is true in somewhat less degree of the wire mills using purchased rods -Unit of measnreIn all statements of tonnage relating to blast furn aces and steel works and rolling mills the ton of 2,240 pounds is used except where otherwise stated On the other hand, the ton of 2,000 pounds is used in expressing the quantities for the wire industry -Number of industrial plants in the four industriesBy reason of the fact that the Census Bureau treats some plants as consisting of two or more establishments, the tota1 number of establishments reported in 1909, for the four industries under consideration, 741, is considerably greater than the ttctual number of separate plants, which was 657 Of the 208 blastfurnace u establishments\" shown, 157 were operated in connection with steel works; and of the 31 tinplate and terneplate \"establishments,\" 27 were departments of rolling mills -The United States as a wholeBecause of the fact that a very large proportion of the output of pig iron is produced in blast furnaces operated in immediate conjunction with steel works, it has been the custom of the Census Bureau for several censuses past to present combined statistics for the two branches of industry In the case of such a combination of statistics, however, the aggregate value of products, as well as the aggregate cost of materials, obtained by adding -the :figures for all establishments involves so much duplication as to lrnve little significance It is possible to determine approximately the ttmount of thcs~ duplications for the later censuses but not for the earlier

product of the blast furnace i:l called \"pig iron,\" regardless of the character or grade of the iron or the disposition made of the productwhether cast into pigs, into :finished forms or shapes, or passed on in the molten state to subsequent processes of manufactu~e F?rmerly alalmost the entire product was cast mto pigs, whence originated the term \"pig iron\" With the development of the steel industry, economy in manufacture was effected by subjecting a largo proportion of the iron while yet in the molten state to further manufacturing processes, most of it being converted into steel -The term \"pig iron,\" unqualified, embraces all grades of iron, including spiegeleisen, f erromanganese, ferrosilicon, and other ferroalloys produced by blast furnaces1 -1 Establishments manufacturing

classified according to the hours of labor prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the avernge number of wage earners employed in each establishment during the year is classified as a total according to tho hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or a less number of hours -The operation of a blast furnace is necessarily continuous, and most furnaces operate with two 12hour shifts and work seven days a week Of the total number of wage earners, 31,729, or 826 per cent, were in establishments where the prevailing hours were over 72 per week, and 1,304, or 34 per cent, in establishments where they were 72 per week No establishments reported their prevailing hours of labor as 54 per week or less, and but onehalf of 1 per cent of the wage earners were employed in establishments where the prevailing hours were between 54 and 60 per week, 3 per cent in establishments where they were 60 per week, and 106 per cent in establishments where they were between 60 and 72 per week -Character of ownershipOnly 12 establishments in the blastfurnace industry, or 58 per cent of the total number, were

cent, and the highest for materials, 904 per cent The lowest percentage for materials was reported for Michigan, 794 per cent The lower ratio in this state is due in part to the fact that most of the Michigan plants are charcoal furnaces manufacturing their own charcoal, and in some cases the labor employed in wood cutting ancl charcoal burning was charged not to material, but to wages -Engines, power, and fuelThe amount of power was fast reported for the industry at the census of 1869, and the total horsepower increased from 63,900 in 1869 to 1,173,422 in 1909 Table 15 shows the number∑ of engines or other motors, according to their character, employed in generating power (including electric motors operated by purchased current) and their total horsepower, as reported 11t the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899 It also shows separately the number and horsepower of electric motors, including those operated hy current generated in the establishments -There has been a striking increase in the use of gas engines Gas engines are of special interest as they represent largely the utilization of what was formerly a waste productblastfurnace gas Some of the gas engines now employed rank in power with the largest steam engines The 60 gas engines reported in 1909 had an aggregate rating of 125,230 horsepower, or an average of 2,087 horsepower per unit; the largest were of 4,000 horsepower At the plant of the Indiana Steel Company at Gary, Ind, the use of blastfurnace gas has been carried to -the point where it is the chief reliance as a source of power, and except for various auxiliary purposes and as a reserve in case the blast furnaces are shut down, steam has no place either in the furnace department or in the steel plant or the rollinomill -The air blast is the largest consumer of power in blastfurnace operations, n large furnace requiring 30,000 or more cubic feet of air per minute to be pumped against a pressure of 11 pounds and upward per square inch -There has also been a very marked increase in the use of electric motors as a means of applying the power generated within the establishment The total horsepower of such motors increased from 8,693

table includes both that used for smelting and that used for the production of power The returns for 1904 and prior censuses did not distinguish between the fuel used for smelting and that used for generating power or for other purposes, but the returns for 1909 make this distinction -The gas shown in Table 16 is nntural gas and does not include blastfurnace gas made and consumed The quantity of blastfumace gas utilized as fuel for steam production and in gas engines was reported for a number of the large plants, from which it has been estimated that there w11s produced by all phmts during the year approximately 2,900,000,000,000 cubic feet of blastfurnace gas, of which only a smtill portion was utilized lhe caloric power of blastfurnace gas is low, about 110 British thermal units per

controlled by the same concerns as controlled tho mines and only 362 per cent was for sale to others The Lake Superior distriot (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) furnished 816 per cent of the total sup}lly, the southern -district (Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee, 103 per cent, and the remainder of the country (chiefly New York, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Now Jersey), 81 per cent Most ore from the Lake Superior district whether sold or otherwise disposed of, is shipped to ~ distance, while most southern ore is used by blast furnaces adjoining the mines -Yield obtained from ore and other ironbearing materialIn addition to ores the blast furnaces in 1909 smelted 1,982,530 tons of mill cinder, scrap, and other iron materials, making with tho ore a total of 50,336,207 tons of ironbearing material They produced from this material 25,651,798 tons of pig iron the average yield thus being equal to 51 per cent of th~ weight of the ironbearing materials used The averacre yield of })ig iron was 521 per cont in 1904, 536 p~r cent in 1899, 54 7 per cent in 1889, and 49 7 per cent in 1879 Although these variations in yield are duo to somo extent to changes in tho proportion of foreign ore and of mill cinder, scrap, etc, Used, they are due chiefly to changes in tho grade of domestic ore used Tho increase in tho percentage of yiold for the decade 18791889 was clue to the development of the rich deposits of Lake Superior Twenty years ago almost all the ore shipped from the Lako Snperior region analyzed over 60 per cent iron, but in the later years more and more ores of lower grade have been sent down to the furnaces -Tabla 19 shows the average percentage of pig iron from ore (including mill cinder and scrap) for furnaces using exclusively southern ores and furnaces using

Patterson and the Uehling typos, with a few Dnvis and Ifartman machines, and others of special design As before stated, 5,096,797 tons of pig iron -The principal facts derived from the census inquiry concerning the blastfurnace industry, other than those relating to specific materials, products, and equipment, are presented, by states, in two general tables Table 34 shows, for 1909, 1904, and 1899, the number of establishments, persons engaged in the in-dustry, primary power used, capital invested, principal classes of expenses, value of products, and value added by manufacture for the United States and for each of the principal producing states Table 35 gives more detailed statistics on the same subjects for 1909 only -Description of the industryThe establishments assigned to this classification are engaged primarily ill the conversion of iron illto steel and ill the rolling of iron and steel The statistics also include the figures for forges and bloomeries, which at earlier censuses were tabulated separately Formerly the manufacture, for sale as such, of hammered charcoal blooms, billets, and bars direct from the ore and from pig iron and scrap was an important part of the industry, and in 1869 there were still 82 establishments of this class, but by 1899 the number of active establishments was reduced to 7, and the tabulation of the statistics for this class of establishments as a separate industry was discontinued in 1904 -In addition to the establishments classified as \"steel works and rolling mills\" there were, ill 1909, 29 establislunents which were engaged primarily in making other more hlghlyfinished products butwhich had steelmaking or hotrolling facilities as minor features of their equipment These 29 establishments were in the following industries: Agricultural implements, 1; steamrailroad cars, 4; cutlery and tools, 1 ; electrical machinery, apparatus, and supplies, 2; files, 1; foundry and machineshop products, 16; saws, 1; shipbuilding, 1; and wire, 2 Data for these establishments are not included in the present section except as indicated1 -Many steelrolling establishments subject the primary products of the rolling mill to further processes of -manufacture; for example, they manufacture wire from wire rods, wroughtwelcled pipe and tubes from skelpJ cut nails from nail plates, etc The statistics in the present section show not only the direct or primary rolled products of the mills, but also such more highly finished products as were made therefrom in the same establishments, except that the tinplate dipping departments of rolling mills have been treated as separate establishments The relation of the steel works and rolling mills to the blast furnaces has already been discussed -Steel works and rollillg mills constitute one of the largest industries in the country The number of persons engaged in the industry in 1909 was 260,762, of whom 240,076 were wage earners, the amount paid in wages being $163)200,758 The value of products shown in the table conveys no precise idea as to the magnitude of the industry, since it involves considerable duplication due to the sale or transfer of the products of one establishment in the industry to another establishment in the industry for use in further manufacture Similarly, the reported cost of materials involves much duplication Were it not for this duplication within the industry itself, the ratio of the value added by manufacture to the value of products would be much higher The value added by manufacture in 1909 was $328,221,678 -1 A

statistics as to value of products do not very closely represent the changes which have taken place in the quantity of output, -∑ and b]oomeries for all years, has not varied greatly, the increase for the 40 years covered by the table being only 57 per cent In the case of value of products, however, the amount for 1909 was over seven times that for 1869 and the average value of products per establishment shows a steady increase from census to censusfrom $325,991 in 1869 to $2,210,140 in 1909 The rate of increase in value of products for the successive decades has been quite uniform, ranging from a minimum increase of 506 per cent for the decade 18691879 to a maximum of 793 per cent for the decade 18891899 The increase in value of products from 1899 to 1909 is perhaps partly attributable to advance in prices, but for some of the more important products the pricesa,!; least the quoted prices in trade journalswere substa,ntia1ly the sitme in both years -Table 37, which gives separately the total number of establishments and value of products for the steel works and rolling mills proper and for forges and bloomeries at each decennial census since 1879, indicates the compara,tive unimportance of the latter at the present time -Geographic distribution,Thesteelworks androllingmill industry is concentrated largely in the Micldle Atlantic and East North Central states, and the panhandle of West Virginia Of the 446 establishments in 1909, 362, or 812 per cent, were located in seven contiguous statesNew York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois The value of products for these seven states amounted to $897,365,567, or 91 per cent of the total for the United States The map on the next page shows the location of the establishments in each state as far west as Minnesota, and Missouri In addition, Texas, Colorado, Wyoming, and Washington reported 1 establishment each, Oregon reported 2, and California 5 -Leading countiesThere are 36 counties which £or 1909 reported products from steel works and rolling -mills exceeding $5,000,000 in value each These 36 counties contained 251 establishments, or 563 per cent of the total for the industry, with products valued at $865,248,156, or 878 per cent of the total Of these counties 15 are in Pennsylvania, 7 in Ohio, 4 in Illinois, 2 in Indiana, 2 in West Virginia, and 1 each in Alabama, Colorado, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, and Wisconsin Table 38 gives for these counties the number of establishments and the value of products so far as this can be shown

aggregate value of products in 1909; steel works with-out rolling mills, only 47 per cent; and rolling mills without steel works, 338 per cent These percentages, however, give a somewhat exaggerated idea of the impoitance of the latter class of mills, because the value of their product consists in considerable part of the value of the crude steel purchased -Pennsylvania  : ï ï ï ï ï stool works

total value of products; Ohio, about onefilth (201 per cent); Illinois, 88 per cent; New York, 4 per cent; and Indiana, 39 per cent The highest percentage of increase in value of products from 1904 to 1909 is shown for California, a state of relatively minor importance in the industry Of the leading producing states, Incliana, owing to the recent great development at Gary, shows the highest percentages of increase699 per cent in wage earners, -Persons engaged in the industryTable 41 shows, by classes, tho number of persons engaged in the industry in 1909 It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by tho mothod described in the Introduction -Females constituted 11 per cent of the total number of persons employed, 109 per cent of the clerks, and fourtenths of 1 per cent of the wage earners The number of wage earners under 16 years of age was -1,139  In order to compare the distribution accord~g to occupational status of persons engaged rn the rndustry in 1909 with that in 1904, it is ne_cessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (see Introduction) Such comparison is made in Table 42 The rate of increase for salaried employees was much higher than that for wage earners, the proportion for the latter class being less ip_ 1909 than in 1904 -Wage earners employed, by monthsIable 44 gives the number of wage earners employed on the 15th (or the nearest representntive day) of ench month during the yeor 1909 for 15 stn,tes in which an averngo of

In the country as a whole the minimum number employed was in March, this number being 758 per cent of the number in December Massachusetts shows the smallest fluctuation in number of wage earners, the minimum number being 796 per cent of the maximum, while West Virginia shows the widest fluctuation, the minimum number being 552 per cent of the maximum number, reported for September The percentage which the number employed each month represented of the maximum number is given in Table 45 for the entire industry The general in-crease in employment from March to Docomber reflects the improvement in bus:ir1css conditions taking place during that time -S:lO December  The months of maximum and of minimum employment for 1909, and the number reported for these months, are given for each state in fable 44 -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 46 the wage earners have been clnssilicd according to the hours of labor prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a

establishments Establishments owned by individuals and fams are few m1d small, and seem to be decreasing in number and importm1co from census to census Steel works and rornng mills are more largely in the hands of corporntions than nny other industry in the country with the exception of the load smelting and refin~g industry Establishments operated by corporations reported 995 per cont of the total value of products in 1909, as compared with 989 per cent :in 1904 -Size of establishmentsThe tendency toward concentration in large establishments is very marked in the steel industry Some light is thrown upon this tendency by grouping the establishments reported acco1∑ding to value of products and according to number of wage earners -A classification of the establishments for 15 of the leading states according to the number of wage earners employed is presented in the followfag table: -Establishments employing 1,000 wage earners or more in 1909 employed altogether 529 per cent of the total number of wage earners in the industry; in fact, 185 per cent of the total were in establishments employing over 4,000 each -Table 51 gives the percentage which the number of wage earners in establishments of each group formed of the total number of wage earners in the industry -ExpensesAs stated in the Introduction, the census does not purport to furnish :figures that can be used for determining the total cost of manufacture and, consequently, the profits Facts of interest can, however, be brought out concerning the relative importance of the clifferent classes of expense which make up the total Table 52 shows, in percentages, for each census from 1889 to 1909, the distribution of the total expenses reported for the industry in the country as a whole among the four classes indicated, and a similar distribution for 15 states separately for 1909 -Labor is a materially more important factor in this branch of the industry than in the blast furnaces In the steel works and rolling mills expenditures for services (salaries and wages) constituted, in 1909, 212 per cent of the total expenses reported, as compared with 86 per cent for the blastfurnace branch of the industry; and those for materials represented 739 per cent, as compared with 884 per cent for the blast furnaces -In this connection it should be borne in mind that the cost of materials in the case of the steel works and -roiling mills involves much duplicntion, due to tho sale or transfer of partially:finished products from one plnnt in the jndustry to ::tnothor Wore it not for this duplication the percentage of tho totn,l reported expenses represented by cost of lnaterials would be much lower In the case of blast furnaces, on tho other hand, there is virtually no such duplication in cost of mntcrials -penses is due largely to the diversity in the character o~ products made and to differences among the states with ~espect to the amount of duplication in cost of -mat,enals During ,the 20 years covered by the table the percentage of the total re1)orted expenses represented by wages fell from 242 to 183, while the proportion represented by materials rose from 704 per cent to -739 per cent and the proportions for other classes also ~dvanced rhese figures doubtless indicate approxunately the actual changes in conditions, but it should be borne in mind that in all probability variations have tnken place from census to census in the relative amount of duplication in cost of materials which would tend to affect the significance of all th; percentngos -Table 53 shows the number of engines or other motors, twcording to their character, employed in generating power (including electric motors operated by purchased current) and their total horsepower at the censuses of 1909, 1!)041 and 1899 It also shows separntely the number and horsepower of electric motors including those operated by current generated in t11; establish;ment -where blast furmwes are operated in conjunction with steel works and rolling mills, blastfurnace gas is utilized in internnJcombl1stion engines for the steel making and rolling depnrtments as well as for the blastfurnnce clepnrtment (see p 14) There has also been a, great increase in the practice of applying primary power generated in the establishments by means of electric motors -The data for the several classes of materials do not include materials produced and consumed in the same establishment; consequently, except in the case of pig iron, ferroalloys, and iron ore they by no means represent the total consumption On the other hand, there is much duplicrtion in the total cost of materials, clue to the fact that the product of one plant is often sold or transferred to another plant for further manufacture The pig iron reported represents the total consumption, the blastfurnace departments of steel works having been treated as separate establishments The ingots, blooms, billets, slabs, muck and scrap bar, and sheet and tin1)late bars represent steel and partly rolled material acquired by the reporting establishments from outside sources for further hot rolling, including material received by transfer -from other plants owned by the same company In some rolling mills finished hotrolled products are subjected to further processes of manufacture, and the cost of such rolled forms acquired from outside sources, with the exception of skelp and wire rods, which are reported separately, is ineluded under \"all other materials -It is evident that the quantities of the partly rolled products and of the :finished rolled forms reported as used as materials by establishments in the industry may vary from census to census merely because of changes in the relationship of plants and the methods of conducting business, so that the changes in the consumption of these materials shown :in the table have little significance as indicating the extent of the growth of the industry -Ingots, blooms, hillols,slabs,

and 35,221 tons were transferred from other plants of the company reporting Besides this, 11401,573 tons of skelp were consnmecl in further manufacture in rolling mills where produced, making a total of 1,578,290 tons consumed in rollingmill establishments in the manufacture of wroughtwelded pipe and tubes This is a much larger consumption of skelp than that in pipemanufacturing concerns independent of rolling mills -The 146,425 tons of wire rods reported under materials\" for 1909 include 18,134 tons purchased and 128,291 tons transferred from other plants of the companies reporting In addition, wire departments of the rolling mills consumed 1,318,796 tons of wire rods made in the same establishments, making tt total of 1,465,221 tons of wire rods used in the manufacture of wire in connection with iron and steel rolling mills This :is not, of course, the total consumption of wire rods, as many are used by concerns in the wire industryproperthat is, by wire plants independent of rolling mills -the quantity and value of the leading individual classes of products In this table duplications due to the consumption of one product in further manufacture in the same plant are eliminated, but, as in most other industries, there are duplications due to the use of the product of one plant as material for another In fact, -the duplications are of enormous amount The extent of these duplications, so far as they are due to transfers from one plant to another of the same company is shown in later tables, but the amount due to pur~ chases of partly manufactured materials can not be -P1ntly :finished rolled products are those which are ordinarily subjected to further rolling by hot rolls The class includes blooms, billets, slabs, sheet and tinplate bars, and muck and scrap bar All :finished rolled products, except shapes rolled direct from the ingot, pnss through one or another of these intermediate forms Tho greater part of these intermediate products, however, arc not sold but are rolled into :finished forms in tho s11mo works Only the output made for sale or ~or transf~r to other works of the producing company 1s shown m the table, so that there is no duplication in tho figures for any given plant, although the greater pnrt of tho value of this group of products represents duplication in cost of materials and value of products for the industry taken as a whole That this is true is shown by the fact that tho tonnage of inOots blooms-billets, slnbs, etc, reported ih Table 55 as material ncquirml by purchase or by transfer from other plants (1f the sitme compnny for rolling (which, however, includes Homo r11ils for rorolling) was equal to 93 7 per cent in 1009, 952 per cent in 1904, and 865 per cent in l 8\\\\lO, of tho tonnage of ingots ancl

these products as shown in Table 58 -Average valnesTable 60 shows average values per ton for the principal classes of products specified in Table 58 -Partly finished rolled products: Blooms, billets, and slallq rolled forging blooms and llillets, and sheet and tinplate liarsïïï -It should be borne in mind that these averages in the case of products transferred to other works of the same concern and products consumed in the same works involve values assigned by the producer or computed on the basis of reports of representative establishments, and may be more or less arbitrary This condition affects somewhat the comparability of the averages from census to census The comparability is still more affected by the fact that each class of products includes a considerable variety of individual commodities, sizes, shapes, etc The values per ton of the ilifferent individual products included in each class often differ considerably from one another, and the plOportion which these individual products represent of the total may vary considerably from one census to another Even for such a commodity as rails, it is impossible to draw definite conclusions regarding the movement of prices from averages based on the total production, as there are considerable variations in prices as between different kinds of rails Thus the rail product of 1909 includes a larger tonnage of alloy steel rails of high value per ton than was included in the production reported at the two preceding censuses Nevertheless, the figures in Table -543 per cent in 1904 Ohio increased its proportion of the output from 13 per cent in the earlier to 161 pel cent in the later year Indiana and Illinois showed higher percentages of the total output in 1909 than in 1904; but the proportions reported by New York and West Virginia remained approximately the same \\x0cSTEEL WORKS AND ROLLING MILLS -58 It will be understood, of course, that most of state which reported the mnnufacture in 1909 of each -Detailed statistics rogtmling tho qwintity and value of individual classes of products made in en,ch state can not be presented as to do so would in many cases disclose tho oporn,tions of indivichrnl

state, however, produced 76 per cent of all structuraJ steel in 1909, though tho proportion was somewhat lower than in 1904, when it was -866 per cent Of the tomu,ge of wire rods, Pennsylvania in 1909 produced 375 per cent, or a larger proportion than in 1904 (333 per cent) Pennsylvania reported about threefilths of the output of plates ancl sheets in 1909, as compared with somewhat over twothirds in 1904; of the skolp produced in 1909, a little more than onehalf was made in Pennsylvania and about onethird in Ohio; of the output of hoops, bands, and cotton ties, Pennsylvania produced 819 per cent; of that of nail and tack plates, 551 per cent -Disposition of finished rolled productsAs akeady stated, the :finished rolled products shown in Table 58 represent the total output, whether sold or used in the establishment where made Many steel works and rolling mills have facilities for the manufacture of certain products∑ of the hot rolls into more highly elaborated forms Table 63 has been prepared in order to show the proportion of the total output of the fmished roJled products that was in 1909 consumed in the same works in which rolled, the proportion transferred to other works of the same company, and that sold -The table shows that, of the total output of finished rolled products and forgings in 1909, 21 per cent was produced for use in the same works and 63 per cent for transfer to other works of the same company, leaving 728 per cent for sale -A very large proportion of the output of skelp, black plates, and wire rods, and a very considerable proportion of some of the other products listed, were, in 1909, used in the works producing them or transferred for further manufacture to other works of the same company It should be noted that while most of the black plates or sheets are shown as produced for tmnsfer to other works of the same company, this results from the fact that, in order to distinguish the tinplate -industry as a separate industry, the tinning departments of rollingmill establishments are treated as separate plants, even though directly connected with the rolling mills -Total production and disposition of unrolled and partly rolled productsTable 58, as already stated, shows, with reference to unrolled and partly rolled products, only the quantity produced for sale or for transfer to other plants of the same concern Table 64 shows for 1909 the total production of the specified intermediate products, the quantity produced for consumption in the same works, the quantity producedfor transfer to other works of the same company, and that produced for sale -Total production and disposition of scrapThe scrap steel and iron reported in rable 58 is only that which was sold or transferred to other plants of the same company The greater portion of the scrap produced is consumed in the furnaces of the producing plants Table 65 shows the total JJroduction and the disposition made thereof in 1909 -Summary as to disposition of products and quantity and value of products in condition in which marketedIt has already been shown that of the finished rolled products and forgings, the total quantity and value of which are mclucled in Group I in Table 58, considerable quantities undergo further processes of manufacture in the same works It has also been stated that the table mentioned does not show the total value of such more highly elaborated products in Group III, but only the value added to the rollingmill products by further manufacture It is desirable, therefore, to show the quantity and value of all products of the industry in the condition in which sold -In Table 66 the total value of the products in the condition in which sold ($864,247,792) contains no duplication due to the use of one product as material for further manufacture in the same plant or in another plant controlled by the same company; but it is impossible to avoid the duplication where the partly finished product of one plant is used as material by another plant in the industry not controlled by the same concern This duplication, however, is not very great -:Manufactures from iron and steel rollingmill products made in rolling millsThe quantity and value of the principal products made in rollingmill establishments from iron and steel rolled products and forgings, and the percentages of increase, are given in Table 67 for 1909 and 1904 Similar products made by establishments assigned to industries other than the rollingmill industry are not here included As already stated the tinplate dipping departments of rolling mills are treated as belonging to tt separate industry -The number of establishments reporting the chle:f of these more advanced products in 1909 is given in Table 68 Some establishments

products in 1909, 32 per cent -Combined production of certain products in rolling mills and in other establishmentsIn addition to the products derived from rolled material which are made in rollingmill establishments and covered by Table 67, large quantities of the same classes of products are made in establishments which do not have rollingmill facilities but purchase rolled material For some of these classes of products detailed returns relative to quantity and value were obtained from the producing -establishments and for some other classes estimates were made Table 70 shows the reported or estimated amount and value of these various classes of products for establishments other than rolling mills and for rollingmill establishments, respectively, and the total for all establishments In stating the number of establishments not rolling mills making each class of articles, only those which made such articles as their chief product are included, but the quantities and

Table 75 States for which the production can not be given without disclosing individual operations are included under\" all othe1∑ states\" The most important of these, in 1909, in order of rank, were New York, Colorado, Maryland, Alabama, West Virginia, and Kentucky The table shows a relative decline since 1899 in the importance of Pennsylvania and Illinois as producers of stcol and a relative gain in that of Ohio and Indiana -tically all, and in Pennsylvania much the larger part of the steel produced in 1909 was made by the open~ hearth process, but in Illinois and Ohio the Bessemer process still predominated -Production for consumption and for saleIn Table 77 is shown the tonnage of steel made for consumption in the works where produced, that transferred to other works of the producing company for consumption, and that produced for sale The castings were in the main produced for sale -Openhearth steel furnacesThe statistics in regard t,o tho number of establishments

furnaces and of 2407 per cent in their capacity; the increase, however, both in number of furnaces and in capacity, was chiefly in furnaces of the basic type -In 1879 the openhearth furnaces ranged from 7 to 10 tons capacity per heat In 1889 furnaces of 20 to 30 tons capacity were common; and in 1899 a large number of furnaces of 50 tons were in use, with at least one of 75 tons In 1904, 169 furnaces of 50 tons and 6 of 60 tons capacity per heat were reported In 1909 approximately onehalf of the openhearth furnaces were rated at 50 tons and over, and there were 2 furnaces of 125 tons capacity per heat or melt The distribution by size groups of the openhearth steel furnaces in 1909 was as follows: -ConvertersThe statistics in regard to the number of establishments equipped with converters and the number, kind, and capacity of converters, are given, by states, for 1909 and 1904, in Table 83 The statistics given include the equipment of a few establishments not classified as

manufacture of steel in electric furnaces of the Heroult type was reported by 4 establishments in 19091 in Illinois, 1 mNew York, and 2 in Pennsylvania The aggreg11te daily capacity of the furnaces of this type was 285 tons of steel, the daily capacity per furnace ru;nging from 5 to 180 tons No electric steel furnaces were reported at prior censuses -Eighteen steelmaking furnaces of other types aggregating 73 tons in daily capacity were reported by 4 establishments1 in Connecticut, 1 in Ohio, and 2 in Pennsylvania These include 12 McHaffie furnaces with a combined daily capacity of 7 tons, 3

capacity from 100 to 500 tons, 24 of them being of 250 tons capacity, 11 of 300 tons, and 2 of 500 tons each -Tha hotrolling equipment ranges in tonnage capacity per day from a few tons to over 10,000 tons Table 85 shows statistics for establishments grouped according to daily capacity of hot rolls :in 1909 Of the 27 states reporting mills there were only 9 :in which any mill was found with a capacity :in excess of 1,000 tons; there were, however, 5 mills situated in Illinois, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania whose capacity was in excess of 5,000 tons -In 1909, 63 establishments reported the operation of works, wholly or in part, on triple turn Of these, 28 were located in Pennsylvania, 21 in Ohio, and 5 in West Virginia These 63 establishments had an aggregate daily capacity on double turn of 12,115 tons They constituted 182 per cont of the 346 rollingmill establishments and represented 81 per cent of the total capacity -Natural gas,Table 86 summarizes the data secured

than details as to materials, products, and equipmentare presented in two general tables, Table 88 showing the more important general statistics of∑ the industry in -Description of the industryThe wire industry in its broad sense consists of the drawing of wire from wire rods, the principal metals used being steel and copper -The manufacture of WllQ is carried on by three classes of establishments: (1) Establishments whose principal business is the drawing of wire from rods - which are either purchased or transferred from independently operated rolling mills of the company, thus including the detached and independently operated wire mills of companies rolling the wire rods; (2) establishments that roll kon and steel, copper or other metals, and maintain wiredrawing departments supplied with rods from the cooperating rolling mills; and -(3) establishments whose principal business is the manufacture of some quite different product, but which incidentally draw some wire, usually as material for their own consumption These three classes are hereafter, for brevity, refe1Ted to as (1) wire mills, (2) wire departments of rolling mills, and (3) wire departments of other concerns, and the term \"purchased rods,\" hereinafter employed to distinguish mills of the first class, comprises wire rods brought into the mills from sources outside the plants, whether acquired from independent plants under the same ownership or in the open market The establishments falling into the third classwire -ï departments of other concerns \"are comparatively unimportant They include the wire departments of one concern whose principal business is the manufacture of brass ware, one making bronze castings, one making electrical machinery, one making cut and wrought nails independently of rollingmill operations, one making sewing machines, and one engaged in smelting and refining dross and scrap (falling under the census classification \"smelting and refining, not from the ore\") All six of these concerns buy their wire rods -Rolling mills which roll steel and maintain wire departments are, for general statistical purposes, classed as an entirety in the industry \"iron and steel, steel works and rolling mills\" Rolling mills which roll copper and brass,includingthosewith wiredrawing departments, are classified by the Census Bureau under the heading \"brass and bronze products Consequently, in the general statistical tables in which all manufacturing industries are listed, only \"wire mills \"namely, those whose principal business is the drawing of wire and which purchase their rods or procure them from independently operated rolling millsare included under the industry designation wire,\" In those tables the data for the wire departments of rolling mills or of other classes of establishments are included with the other businessi of such concerns This special report, -however, deals in the fust place with the wire industry in its broader sense, presenting statistics of the total wire business by whatever class of establishments conducted The statistics thus presented relate chiefly to the quantity and value of materials and products, separate reports relating to these subjects being obtained from the wire departments of rolling mills and other concerns No attempt was made, however, to segregate the statistics of capital, persons engaged in the industry, and expenses of operation for such wiredrawing departments, as such a segregation was deemed impracticable -In addition to presenting these statistics for the wire industry as a whole the present section gives statistics regarding capital, labor, expenses, and other subjects for the wire mills using purchased rods, or for the wire industry in the narrower sense It should be constantly borne in mind in considering these latter statistics that they relate to less than half of the total wire production -There are many establishments which draw no wire, but which manufacture wire goods (fencing, wire cloth, springs, etc) from purchased wire Such establishments are not covered by the statistics for the wire industry The manufacture of such further elaborated products from wire is, however, often conducted in wiredrawing establishments, and to that extent this branch of business is covered by the statistics here presented  -In the present report comparisons are made, so far as is possible, between the statistics for 1909 and those of the two preceding censuses of manufactures, covering the years 1904 and 1899, respectively Prior to the present census, however, detailed reports regarding materials and products were not obtained from establishments drawing wire from purchased rods, or from copper and brass rolling mills with wire departments, but only from wire departments of iron and steel rolling mills -Summary for the wire industry as a wholeTable 90 shows the relative importance, from the standpoint of value of wire products, of the three classes of estab lishments above described -of products of the wire mills, 508 per cent that of the wire departments of rolling mills, and 35 per cent that of the wire departments of other concerns The total value of products involves very little duplication THE WiltE Il,DUSTJ\\\\Y: 1000-Size of establishmentsThe returns permit of a grouping of the establishments in the industry as a whole according to the value of their products, and Table 91 shows data for plants with products of less than $1,000,000 in value and for plants with products valued at $1,000,000 and over in 1909 -This table shows the extent to which the large plants predo,minate, especially among the wire departments of rolling mills The 24 wire departments of rolling mills whose product exceeded $1,000,000 in -Distribution of establishments, by states, according to character of businessTable 00 shows the total number of establishments in the industry as a whole in each state, and also the number of establishments engaged in the manufacture of each of the principal classes of wire products Of course, many establishments make more than one kind of product, and are therefore listed :more than once in the table It would be impossible to present statistics regarding the quantity and value of individual kinds of products for any considerable number of states separately without disclosing the operations of individual concerns -Importance and growth of the industryThis section of the report on the wire industry deals exclusively with wire mills as above definedthat is, with concerns whose principal business is the drawing of wire and which acquire their wire rods from other establishments As already shown, such concems produced in 1909 less than half of the total wire output, and in 1899 their proportion of the total was about onefilth The statistics here presented correspond with those presented under the industry designation \"wire\" in -Comparisons between the data for the different years in this table do not give a correct idea of the growth of the wire industry as a whole The industry has developed rapidly but by no means at such a rate as shown by these :figures lhe explanation of the extraordinary di:fference between the :figures given for 1899 and those given for 1909 is found in the fact that the great bulk of the wiredrawing business was in the earlier year conducted in the wire departments of rolling mills, while in the later year nearly half of itwas conducted in separate plants which bought the ~re rods used Data regarding the wire industry in its broader sense are not available for 1904 and 1899, but an approximate idea of its growth may be gained from the statistics of the production of wire rods of iron and steel already presented in Part IV The output of such wire rods in 1899 was 916 587 lon(l-The cost of materials in 1909 represented 717 per cent of the total value of products, and the value added by manufacture 283 per cent -Summary, by statesTable 94 summarizes the more important statistics for wire mills using purchased rods, by states, for 1909, the states being arranged according to the value of products Comparisons with previous censuses (1,10 not made because for the reason indicated above, they have no signi:fi~ cance as showing the growth of the wire industry The data reported for 1904 and 1899 are, however, shown in Table 112 -Persons engaged in the industryTable 95 shows, by classes, for 1909, the number of persons engaged in the wire mills using purchased rods It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction The total number of persons engaged in such mills in 1909 was 19,945, of whom 18,084, or 907 per cent, were wage earners -according to sex Data for 1899 are not given because the mills which purchased rods were at that time only a very small factor in the wire industry -Wage earners employed, by months,Table 97 gives the number of wage earners employed in the wire mills of the country on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 -The fluctuations in number of wage earners were comparatively small The month of minimum employment was April, when the number reported was -872 per cent of the maximum number, which was reported for December The increase from April to December apparently reflects the general improvement in business conditions which took place during the year Prevailing hours of laborWage earners in wire mills using purchased rods have been classified according to the hours prevailing in the establishment in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment is classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees work a greater or less number of hours There is a marked uniformity in the hours of labor prevailing in this industry Of the 18,084 wage earners in 1909, 7,626, or 422 per cent, were in establishments where the prevailing hours were between 54 and 60 per week; 10,232, or -566 per cent, in establishments where they were 60 per week; and only 12 per cent in establishments where they were 54: or less or more than 60 per week Character of ownershipTablc 98 has for its purpose the presentation of conditions in respect to the character of ownership, or legal organization, of the wire mills using purchased rods -Establishments operated under corporate ownership dominate the industry Of the establishments under individual and firm ownership in 1909, three were owned by individuals and four by firms; the three reported for 1904 were operated by firms -Size of establishmentsTable 99 groups the wire mills using purchased rods according to the value of products and shows, for each group, the number of establishments and value of products, together with the percentage of the respective totals represented by each group, for 1909 and 1904 -ï Less than onetenth ol 1 per cent In 1909 establishments with products valued at $1,000,000 or more constituted only 304 per cent of the total number of establishments, but employed 736 per cent of the wage earners and produced 822 per cent of the total value of products -Table 100 shows, for 1909, the number of wire mills grouped according to the average number of wage earners employed for each group for seven of the leading states -The most numerous group of establishments was that comprising establishments employing from 101 to 250 wage earners, but the group employing the greatest number of wage earners was that comprising the three establishments employing over 1,000 wage earners each -Engines, power, and fuelTuble 101 shows, for wire mills using purchased rods, the number of engines or other motors, according to their character, employed in generating power (including electric motors operated by purchased current) and their total horsepower, as reported at the censuses of 1909 and 1904 It also shows separately the number and horespower of all electric motors, including those operated by current generated in the establishments Data fm: 1899 are not presented because the wire mills using purchased rods at that time represented only a small part of the wire industry -This table indicates a decided relative increase in the use of gas engines and in the use of rented electric power between 1904 and 1909 Moreover, a much larger proportion of the primary horsepower generated in the establishments themselves was applied by means of electric motors ju the later year than in the earlier -Table 102 shows, by states, for 1909, the amount of each of the several kinds of power, as well as of the different∑ kinds of fuel, used in the wire mills which purchased wire rods, by states -The statistics regarding materials, products, ancl equipment presented in this section cover not only the wire mills using pufchased rods, but also the wire departments of rolling mills and of other concerns producing wire In general, the tables show the totals for the wire industry as a whole and then show separately the data for wire mills primarily engaged in drawing wire from purchased ( or transferred) rods and for all other wiredrawing establishments -MaterialsTable 103 gives, in detail, the statistics for wire rods consumed in 1909, and for wire purchased as such and used by establishments in the industry either for redrawing or in the manufacture of wire goods of various sorts The cost of fuel and rent of power, as well as of  all other materials,\" can be given only for the wire mills using purchased rods, but the quantity and cost of the principal materials can be shown for the entire in- dustry The materials included under the heading \"all other materials\" consist of zinc, tin, lead, sulphuric and muriatic acids, oil, lime, containers, mill supplies, and the like Quantities are given in short tons -ï Brass, bronze, German silver, zinc, etc, chiefly brass For the wire mills using purchased rods the expense for fuel and rent of power and for  all other materials\" (that is, materials other than wire rods and wire) was equal to 182 per cent of the cost of wire rods and wire If a like ratio is assumed for the wire departments of rolling mills ancl other concerns, the total cost of materials for all wireclra wing establishments and departments can be estimated at about $137,000,000 -541 per cent were of openhearth steel and 457 per cent of Bessemer steel, only threetenths of 1 per cent being of crucible and other steel hi wire mills using purchased rods the consumption of Bessemer steel rods largely exceeded that of openhearth steel rods, while in wire departments of rolling mills and other concerns the consumption of openhearth steel rods, chiefly basic, was nearly twice that of Bessemer steel rods The purchasecl wire reported as material by some of the establishments includes both plain and coated wire Approximately twothirds of the steel wire rods are used by the wire departments of steel rolling mills The use of iron wire rods is not large, most of them being used in the wire departments of concerns other than steel works and rolling mills The greater part of the rods of \"other metals or alloys,\" most of which are of brass, are used in the wiredrawing departments of brass 1∑olling mills, but more than twothirds of the copper rods are used in wire mi11s using purchased rods -The per cent distribution of the total cost of the wire rods used in 1909 according to kind of metal is given in Table 104 -Of the total cost of wire rods usecl hy the industry as a whole, 60 per cent represented the cost of iron and steel rods, 363 per cent that of copper ro(ls, and 38 per cent that of rods of other metals or alloys The \"percentages by weight are of course very different, copper being much more v:aluable than iron and st~el ProductsTable 105 gives, for 1909, the quantity and value of the products in detail for wire mills -usiI1g purchased rocfa and for the wire departments of rolling mills and other concerns, respectively Comparative data for earlier years are not available Quantitie~ are given in sholt tons -335 per cent of the product from copper The per cent distribution of the value of the wire and wire products, according to the metal from which made, is shown in Table 106 -It will be perceived that the value of steel and iron wire and wire products reprosent,ed a considerably higher proportion of the value of all wire and wire products than the cost of steel and iron rods represented of the total cost of rods consumed This is due largely te> the fact that the steel and iron products include a much larger proportion of elaborated wire goods than the copper products In the case of the steel and iron products, twothirds of the tonnage is represented by wire goods carrying a considerable enhancement in value over plain wire, while in the case of the copper products such wire goods form less than 10 per cont of the total tonnage Manufactures from purchased wire necessadly enter into the products as reported, but wire purchased is not distributable as a material according to the kind of metal -The manufacture of insulated wire and cable to the value of $9,806,989 was reported by the establishments in the wire industry in 1909 The quantity and value of the bare wire employed in the manufacture of this insulated wire and cn,blo is included under \"copper wire\" in the table, the increase in value on account of insulation being included under \"all other products\" Most insulated wire is made by establishments in the industry \"electrical machinery, apparatus, and supplies\" The total value of the insulated wire and c11ble manufactured in 1909 was $51,624,737 -The quantity of wire drawn from the different metals, whether for sale or for use in further manufacture by the producing concern, is shown in Table 107 Steel and iron wire represented 936 per cent of the total tonnage in 1909, copper wire 58 per cent, and wire of other metals or alloys 07 per cent -Table 108 shows the quantity of wire drawn from the different meto1s in 1909, whether for sale or further manufacture, in the

mills drawing wire from purchased rods, and it should be constantly borne in mind that such mills in 1909 represented less than half of the wire industry and in 1904 and 1899 a very much smaller proportion (about onefilth in 1899) -salaries, wages, cost of materials, value of products, and value added to materials by manufacture For the reason stated above, the progress of the wire industry in genernl can not be judged at all by the changes which took place between 1899 and 1909, as shown in this table -Tinplate manufacture involves two i∑a<lically different processesthe rolling of the black plates and the dipping of them in tin or terne mixture The manufacture of black plate is a rollingmill operation and the bulk of the dipping is performed by clipJ)ing departments of such rolling mills Separate reports were, however, obtained for these <lipping departments, as well as for the establishments which were engaged exclusively in the clipping branch of the industry and which bought their black plates, -In the general statistical tables in Volumes VIII and IX of the reports of the Thirteenth Census the clipping -of tin plate (including the dipping departments of rolling mills) is shown as a separate industry, the manufacture of the black plates being covered by the statistics for steel works and rolling mills The statistics of mills rolling black plates are also included with those for other rolling mills in Part IV of this report In the present report on tin and terne plate manufacture, however, statistics for the blackplate mills are also shown The fast section of this report presents the combined statistics for the blackplate mills and for the tin and terne clipping departments or establishments, the second section gives statistics for the blackplate branch of the industry separately, and the third gives the statistics for the tinplate and ternepla te dipping business The last section is more detailed than the others, since it presents an analysis of that branch of the business which is treated by the Census Bureau as constituting in itself a distinctive industry -Table 114 gives the most important figures relative to the tinplate industry as a whole, including blackplate manufacture and tinplate and terneplate dipping It may be noted that some rolling mills which roll black plates for tinning also produce other plates -Md sheets and still other rolled products, the data for which are included in the statistics in this table -Of the 34 establishments in the combined industry in 1909, 27 both rolled black plates and dipped them, 3 rolled black plates but had no dipping departments, while 4 were engaged in ti11 and terne dipping onJy The number of coch of these groups of establishments was smaller :in 1909 than in 1899, but the decrease was greatest in the number clo:ing a dipping business only and tho number making black plates with no dipping departments There has been a growing tendency to consolidate the two branches of the business -The net value of all products in 1909 (excluding duplication on account of the black plates :figuring both as products of the blackplate rolling mills and as materials for the dipping establishments) was $65,378,580, of which amount the value of tin and terno plates represented 701 per cent In 1904 the value of the tin and terno plate product formed 80 9 per cent of the net value of all products of these establishments, and in -Table 115 shows the general statistics of the blackplate mills, exclusive of the clipping departments, for the years 1909, 1904, and 1899 The 30 establishments rolling black plate inelude 3 equipped both for the manufacture of steel and for rolling the steel into plates, and 27 equipped for rolling only The 3 establishments comprising the first group reported products in 1909 valued at $4,285,683 and the 27 in the second group, products valued at $42,104,403 The value of the plates turned over to dipping departments is sometimes fixed in a more or less a:rbitrary manner and may differ from the market value  -The equipment of the blackplate departments of tinplate and ternep late mills is shown in Table 116 -The remainder of this section of tho report deals exclusively with the dipping of tin and terne plate It covers the dipping departments of establishments -The bulk of the capital reported as invested in the industry represents capital assigned to the dipping departments of rolling mills manufacturing tinplate -∑ and terneplate, and the basis on which this assignment was made may not have been the same for all establishments for all years -The number of establishments in the industry decreased from 1899 to 1909, while the number of wage earners increased 458 per cent and the value of products 504 per cent -The dipping of tinplate and terncplate is a comparatively simple process and is carried on principally by machinery As a result, wages formed but 71 per cent of the total expenses of the industry in 1909, as compared with 895 per cent for materials The value added by manufacture represented only 127 per cent of the value of products in 1909 The number of wage earners in 1909, 5,352, was less than twofifths as great as the number employed in the blackplate mills -Persons engaged in the mdustryTable 118 shows, by classes, for 1909, the number of persons engaged in the industry -The average number of persons engaged in the tinplate and terneplate dipping industry during 1909 was 5,846, of whom 5,352, or 915 per cent, were wage earners A considerable number of women, and a few boys under 16 years of age, were employed -In order to compare the distribution of persons engaged in the industry in 1909 according to occupational status with that in 1904, it 1s necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (see In troduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 119 Comparable figures for 1899 are not ovailable -The table shows a relatively large increase in salaried employees and a small increase in wage earners -Table 120 shows the average number of wage earn ers, distributed according to age periods, and in the case of those 16 years of age and over, according to sex, for 1909, 1904, and 1899 The table :indicates a mate rial decrease in the number of women employed -Starting with a low number in January the number of wage earners in the industry in the country as a whole increased steadily to the maximum in June, then dropped to Lhe minimum826 per cent of the maximumin July, and increased again steadily until November Of the three states reported separately, Ohio shows the greatest fluctuations in number of wage earners and West Virginia the least -Prevailing hours of labor,In Table 122 the wage earners in the tinplate and terneplate dipping industry for the three leading states have been classified according to the hours of labor prevailing in the establishments in which they are employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment is classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though some employees work a greater or less number of hours -More than fourfifths of the wage earners employed in the industry in 1909 were in establishments where the prevailing hours of labor were 54 or from 54 to 60 per week Only 52 per cent of the total were employed in establishments where the prevailing hours were as high as 60 per week -Character of ownershipOf the 31 establishments in the industry, 2 were owned by jnclividuals, 1 by a firm, and 28 by corporations -Size of establishmentsThe tendencv toward concentration in large establishments, wbi~h prevails in the iron and steel industry, is very marked in the tin and terne plate industry This is plainly shown m Table 123, which groups the est11blishments according to the value of their products for 1909 and 1904 -A classification of the establishments according to the number of wage earners employed is presented in Table 124 -lhc largest number of establishments and the largest number of wage earners are found in the group employ, ing from 101 to 250 wage earners each The average number of wage e11rners per establishment increased from 135 in 1904 to 173 in 1909 -ExpensesTable 125 gives, in percentages, the distribution of the total reported expenses of tinplate and terneplate dipping plants in 1909 among the several classes of expenses -The cost of materials constitutes a larger proportion of the total expenses in the tinplate and terncplate dipping industry than in most other manufac turing industries -Engines and powerPower is not used largely in the tin and tome dipping industry The majority of the establishments are departments of rolling mills, and in many such casesthere is no separate power plant for the dipping department and the quantity of power supplied from the general power plant can not be -692 per cent in 1909, while the percentage of the total cost represented by coating metals increased from 184 per cent in 1899 to 226 per cent in 1904 and 231 per cent in 1909 The statistics indicate a decrease i_n the a:erage cost of black plates per pound and an increase lll the average cost of coating metals used per pound of black plates This increase in the cost of coating metal is due entirely to an advance in the price of tin, lead showing a decrease in average cost per pound -ï In addition, the following materials were used in tlrn mauufaotme of tinplate11nd terneplate by 3 establishments classified as engaged in the manufacture of

by establishments in the dipping industry, a small production was reported in 1909 by three establishments which were engaged primarily in other branches of manufacture but which incidentally made some tin plate and terneplate, chiefly for use in their own further processes The total output of tin plato and terneplate and taggers tin made by these three establishments amounted to 8,389,200 pouncls, making an aggregate production in all classes of establishments of 1,343,103,266 pounds The output and value of tin plate and terneplate made by establ:shments not classifiecl as in the tinpln,te and terneplate dipping industry was not reported separately in 1904 or 1899 -Of the combined output of tin plate and terneplate and tnggcrs tin in 1909, tin plate formed 841 per cent, terneplate 144 per cent, nnd taggers tin and other tin orterne plated sheets 15 per cent The proportion represented by the several cfosses was substanliially the same in 1904 and 1899, except that the proportion of taggers tin, etc, was somewhat smaller -Production compared with imports and exportsThere has been a great change in the Telative impor: tance of imports, as compared with the domestic production of tin plate and taggers tin This change is shown by Table 129, which gives the domestic production in each of the census yeaTs since 1889, together with the expoTts and imports dUTing the same year -The establishment of the tinplate industry in the United States dates from 1891, practically the entire domestic market previous to that date being supplied by imports By 1899 the clomestic production had become over six times as great as the imports, while in 1909 it was over nine times as great as the impoTts, and there was a considerable exportation of the domestic product The laTger part of the tin plate which is now imported is manufactured into tin cans which are subsequently exported, a drawback of the duty paid upon the imported tin plate being secured -llncludes 3

product for 1909 was equal to 776 per cent of the full capacity of all active establishments on double turn on the basis of 300 working days for the year; the output of tin plate alone was 906 per cent of the annual capacity of tinning sets on double turn, and the terneplate product -423 per cent of the capacity of terne dipping sets In 1904 the tinplate and terneplate product was 495 per cent of the capacity of all active establishments on double turn The majority of the establishments operate on double or triple turn Of the 31 establishments in the tinplate and terneplate dipping industry proper, 5 operated on single turn in 1909, 10 on double turn, and 16 on triple turn The aggregate daily capacity of these plants as operated was 7,016,000 pounds, and their actual output in 1909 was 625 per cent of their total capacity, on the basis of 300 working clays for the year There were, in 1909, 14 establishments engaged in the manufacture of tin plate exclusively and 4 in the manufacture of terneplate exclusively, while 13 establishments made both tin plate and terneplate Five esta,blishments reported 49 tinplate or terneplate sets as being in course of construction -Materials, products, and equipment, by statesThe detailed statistics of materials, products, anrl equipment for the tinplate and terneplate dipping industry in 1909 are given in Table 131 -TIN PLATE AND TERNEPLATEDETAILED STATISTICS OF NUMBER OF ESTABLISHMENTS MATERIALS, PRODUCTS, AND EQUIPMENT, BY STATES: 1909  -The principal facts derived from the census inquiry concerning tinplate and terneplate dipping are presented in two general tables -This industry includes the manufacture of the ma,chines and appliances used in the generation, transmission, and utilization of electric energy, together with most of the parts, accessories, and supplies for them It docs not include, however, the production of poles, whether of wood, iron, or steel; nor does it inelude the mnnufocturo of glass and

operations, although this state ranked higher than several of the others for which :figures are given -The diagram on the next page shows graphically the value of products for the most impeJrtant states in the industry in 1909 and 1899 -Although establishments engaged in the manufacture of one or more of the various classes of products embraced in this industry were reported from 38 states and the District of Columbia in 1909, the industry was largely centralized in the six states of New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Ohio These states, together, reported 84 per cent of the total avemge number of wage enrners, 826 per cent of the total value of products, and 831 per cent of the total value added by manufacture -New York was the leading state in the industry, rnnking first at the censuses of 1909 and 1904 During 1909 the state produced electrical machinery, apparatus, and supplies to the value of $49,289,815, or more than onefilth of the total for the United States The number of wage earners employed in -the state increased 83 per cenb during the decade ending with 1909, while the value of products and the value added by manufacture more than doubled Pennsylvania ranked second among the states in 1909 and 1904 in value of products and in value added by manufacture, though in the average number of wage earners employed it dropped from second place in 1904 to fourth place in 1909 In 1909 New Jersey, which showed the most rapid development of any of the six leading states in the industry, ranked third in -number of wage earners employed and value of products, advancing from fourth place in number of wage earners and from frlth place in value of products during the preceding five years Michigan, which -occupies a position of minor importance among the states in the industry, shows the largest percentages of increase in all three items, while Connecticut,  Indiana, and Wisconsin also show large relative gains -1

the number of persons engaged in the in~ dustry, classified according to occupational status and sex, and in the case of wage earners, according to age also It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -The proportion of women employed as wage earners increased from 166 per cent of the total in 1899 to -227 per cent in 1909 The proportion ofmales over 16 years of a,ge decreased during the same period from 82 per cent to 764 per cent and the proportion of children from 14 per cent to ninetenths of 1 per cent Wage earners employed, by months,Table 6 gives the number of wage earners employed in the industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 for the 12 states in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed during the year -The average number of wage earners in each stute for 1909, 1904, and 1899 is given in Table 28 The distribution of the average number by sex u11d age is not shown for the individual states, but Table 29 gives, for 1909, such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, or the nearest representntive day Female wage earners were reported in 21 of the states for which separate figures are shown, the largest number, 4,890, being reported in New Jersey, and the next largest number, 3,492, in Massachusetts Most of the wage earners under 16 years of age were reported from Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania -In order to compare the distribution of the persons engaged in the industry in 1909 according to occupational status with that in 1904, itis necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 4 -Table 5 shows the average number of wage earners in the industry distributed according to age and in -1 rho month of maximum employment for each state Is lndict1ted by boldface figures and that of minimum employment by italic figures -ber being equal to 953 per cent of the former There was a continuous gain from month to month in the number of wage earners employed in 1909 from January to November, inclusive, followed by n slight decrease in December In 9 of the 12 states shown in the table the month of maximum employment was December -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 7 the wage earners in the industry in 1909 have been classified according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours Jlrevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or smaller number of hours -More than threefourths (76 per cent) of the wage earners employed in the industry in 1909 were in establishments where the prevailing number of hours per week was either 54, or between 54 and 60 Of the remainder 172 per cent were in establishments where the prevailing hours of employment were less -than 54 per week, and 68 per cent in establishments where the prevailing hours were 60 or more per week -By far the largest number of the wage earners in the industry, 45,538, or 522 per cent of the total number, were employed in establishments where the prevailing homs per week were between 54 and 60 This was also the most prevalent working time in all but four of the individual states for which figures are given In Illinois the group working between 48 and 54 hours per week was the most in1portant; in Missouri and Pennsylvania the group working 54 hours; and in Michigan that working 60 hours -Character of ownershipT11ble 8 presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 with respect to the character of ownership of establishments manufacturing electrical machinery, apparatus, nnd supplies in the United States -Establishments owned by corporatfons constituted more than twothirds of the total number of establishments reported, and the value of their products represented 963 per cent of the total value in 1909∑ and 95 per cent in 1904 -Table 11 gives a classification of establishments, according to the number of wage earners employed, for the leading states in the industry -The total primary power used in the industry increased from 43,674 horsepower in 1899 to 158,768 horsepower in 1909, or 2635 per cent Steam engines still supply the greater part of the power used in the industry, although such power re1)rese;nted a smaller proportion of the total primary power in 1909 than in 1899 Some part of this decrease in the proportion of steam power is due to the great increase that took place during the decade in rented electric power -The horsepower of electric motors used for distributing power by means of current generated in the establishments in the industry shows an increase from -New York and Pennsylvania together reported 87,642 horsepower, or 552 per cent of the aggregate for the industry Steam power was the most important form of primary power used in 9 of the 12 states shown separately, rented ∑electric power ranking second In Michigan, Missouri, and Pennsylvania rented electric power ranked first and steam power second The largest amount of steam power used by any state was 33,854 horsepower, by New York, which state also reported the greatest amount of rented electric power Gas and other internalcombustion engines were used to some extent by 11 of the 12 states named in the table, Ohio leading with 2,306 horsepower, or 341 per cent of the total -Fuel consumedBituminous coal was the principal class of fuel used, 632,870 short tons being consumed during 1909 Gas and oil were also used to a considerable extent, the largest, quantity of tho former being reported for Ohio, and of the latter for New York -So many different kinds of machines, apparatus, supplies, and :fixtures are manufactured for use in the generation and utilization of electricity that it was impracticable to secure separate statistics of the number and value of each class of articles produced, and the inquiries were therefore con:fined to the most important and distinctive articles or groups of articles -1904, and 1899 relative to the manufacture of the different kinds or groups of electrical machinery, apparatus, and supplies for which separate totals were compiled at the census of 1909 The :figures given represent not only the manufacture of such products by -In reporting the totals for the several groups shown in this table, it is improbable that all establishments classified their products in exactly the same way For example, some establishments probably reported various articles as \"sockets, receptacles, bases, etc,\" which other establishments reported as circuit fittings of all kinds,\" etc While these variations h1 the reports do not affect the statistics for the more important and welldefmed products, such as dynamos, transformers, and motors, they probably do, in a measure, destroy the comparability of the figures -for some of the less distinctive products The percentages of increase from census to census in the various products arei therefore, not shown in Table 14 -Sockets, roco&tuclcst lJ11Ses, etc ElectricJigh h1g fix ures

statistics are showni in that they are necessary to generate the electrical energy which other classes of electrical machinery and apparatus are designed to distribute and utilize -During the decade ending with 1909 there was an increase of 595 per cent in the number, and of 1432 per cent in the total capacity, of dynamos produced The average capacity per nrnchine increased from 55 kilowatts in 1899 to 84 kilowatts in 1909 The increase in average capacity is confined to alternatingcurrent machines, as there was a decrease for the decade in that of the directcurrent machines Alternatingcurrent dynamos more than doubled in number, value, 1:md aggregate kilowatt capacity during the :five years from 1904 to 1909, and the average capacity per machine increased from 269 kilowatts in 1904 to 341 kilowatts in 1909 During the same period the average capacity of directcurrent machines decreased from 47 to 30 kilowatts -Transformers,Roughly speaking, a transformer consists essentially of an induction coil in which the primary wire is long and thin, with many turns, as compared with the secondary wire, which is short and thick and has few turns; or these conditions may be reversed, making the primary wire thick and the aeconda:ry wire thin This winding varies in accordance with the particular uses for which the transformer is required They are used both for steppingup the electromotive force to a voltage suitable for economical transmission, and for stepping it down again to safe pressures at the point of consumption Table 17 shows the total production of transformers in 1909, 1904, and 1899, and separate statistics of apparatus -of wire∑ foI111dry and machlncïsllop products; gas nnd electric fixtures, and lampsand reflectors; rubber boots and shoos; brass and bronze products; rubber ~oods, -Table 15 shows, so far as possible, the value of the different electrical machines and appliances manufactured in 1909 as subsidiary products by establishments in other industries These figures are included in the totals shown in Table 14 -having a capacity of less than 50 kilowatts, and for those having a capacity of 50 kilowatts and over for the years 1909 and 1904 The figures showing the capacity of individual transformers were not reported -Table 17 includes the large transformers used in central stations as well as those used on electric lines There was a decided increase in the nu;mber and value of the transfor;rners manufactured and a much greater increase in their capacity in 1909 as compared with those produced in 1899 The number increased 110l per cent, the capacity 4352 per cent, and the value 197 per cent More than ninetenths (948 p~r cent) of the transformers in 1909 were of comparatively small size havu1g a capacity of less than 50 kilowatts While the 3,953 transformers with a capacity of 50 kilowatts and over manufactured during 1909 formed only 52 per cent of the total number, their total capacity amounted to 1,058,021 kilowatts, or 647 per cent of the total kilowatt capacity of all transformers produced during the year Some idea of increasi~g size of transformers may be had from the fact that m 1909 the average capacity of the transformers of 50 kilowatts and over was 267 7 kilowatts, as co;rnparecl with an average of 1116 kilowatts in 1904 -Switchboarcls,Table 18 shows the value of the switchboards, panel boards, and cutout cabinets for light and power work manufactured during 1909, 1904, and 1899 in eight of the leading states for which comparable figures are available -Each system of centralized electrical supply requires a switchboard for the manipulation of its circuits and to connect the sources of supply with the consumer The switchboards shown in the table are those used for Hght and power work and differ distinctly from the switchboards used in telegraphic and telephonic work, -At one time the manufacture of switc oar s∑or 1ght and power stations was ca:Tied on b! a larg~ nu~ber of establishments, and then∑ production required little else than skillful working in hardwood At present switchboards of the above type are made of slate or marble slabs with framework of copper, iron, and steel, and involve many problems of apparatus adjustment For this reason the large electrical manufacturing companies have virtually taken over the c?nstruction _of the larger switchboards for the plants whtc~ they eqmp, and have made a business also of supplymg many of the indicating and recording instruments used in connection with the boards The value of these appurtenances of light and power work increased 1039 :per cent from 1899 to 1904, and 2234 per cent durmg the decade 18991909 New York and Pennsylvania were the leading states in this branch of manufacture, reporting 675 per cent of the t?tal value of the~e products in 1909, as compared with 763 per cent m 1899 -, Includes motor parts and supplies valued 11t $2,794,779 To what extent such values were includccl at prior censuses is unlmown, since no data bearmg upon tho point were collected -ï Includes motors valued at $2,008,455 Car which the number and horsepower were not reported; 11nd 60 motors valued at $201,722 for which tho horsepower was not reported The number, capacity, and value of motors for transforming electric current into mechanical power were very much larger in 1909 than in 1899 The number of motors of all kinds produced increased -2155 per cent during the decade, their capacity 1238 per cent, and their value 645 per cent The largest increases are shown in the case of the motor:J for \\x0cELECTRICAL MACHINERY, APPARATUS, AND SUPPLIES -operating stationary machinery, which are designated in the table as motors for industrial power During the decade ending with 1909 the number of these motors for distributing power to be used industrially increased 5837 per cent, their capacity 2265 per cent, and theiT v11lue 1424 per cent The avell1ge capacity of these motors decreased from 14 horsepower in 1899 to 7 horsepower in 1909 Of the motors desiglll1ted to be used for industri11l purposes the largest increases -are shown in the case of those operated by alternating current The totol capacity of such motors increased from 137,376 horsepower in 1899 to 1,006,995 in 1909, though the average cap11city per machine decreased from 23 horsepower in 1899 to 7 horsepower in 1909 At the census of 1899 only the largest motors were of the alternating current type, but at the census of 1909 alternating current was so generally used that the average capacity of motors of both types was about the same In sections where electric power is available, new manufacturing establishments generally use it in preference to steam or water The general report on manufactures shows a lo,rge increase in the use of electric power In 1909 there were 388,854 electric motors with o, capacity of 4,817,140 horsepower installed in manufacturing establishments In -The production of motors intended for other purposes did not increase so rapidly as those built for furnishing power for industrial purposes Of the three designated varieties of motors embraced in this group, those used for the operation of fans predominate in number, cap0,city, and vnJue, 1111d during the dec0,de 18991909 they increased 1041 per cent in number, 1,2946 per cent in capacity, and 1322 per cent in value The average c11pacity of these motors was nearly seven times as great in 1909 as in 1899, while the total horsepower was netirly fourteen times as great The improved methods of ventilation in theaters, halls, hotels, factories, etc, have called for electric fans or blowers of larger size, so that the average capacity of fan motors increased approximately from onetenth of 1 horsepower in 1899 to ninetenths of 1 horsepower in 1909 In this connection it should be stated that a few of the largest manufacturers of fan motors were unable to definitely state theiT total capacity, and in such cases the capacity was estimated The :figures, however, are presented subject to these restrictions -The statistics for the manufacture of electric railway motors for 1909 can not be shown separately without disclosing the operations of individual establishments, and for this reason they are combined in Table 19 with those for motors for miscellaneous uses It may be stated, however, that the number of electric railway motors manufactured in 1909 was considerably gren,ter than tl11tt in Hl04, when 12,298 motors, with a capacity of 713,181 horsepower, were reported, valued at $4,949,795 -ï Includes batteries to the value of $11500 for which numbcr was not reported a Not reported separately Both storage and primary batteries consist of various elements which are not always sold together as a unit by the same manufacturer, and yet it is not until these are brought together that 11 complete cell is constituted In fact, many of the parts and supplies lie outside the electrical field For example, the primary battery consists of various elements, such as the jars, zinc, copper, carbon, sulphuric acid, caustic soda, bichromate of potassium, according to the nature of the cell, on the constant renewals of which the efficiency and life of the cell depend -The value of storage and prim11ry batteries manufactured and of parts and supplies for the same increased 1885 per cent during the decade The value of primary b11tteries manufactured in 1909 showed an :increase of 4987 per cent over the value of those turned out in 1899, while the value of storage batteries increased but 658 per cent during the decade, the larger part of this increase being for the fiveyear period 19041909 Of the total value of batteries and parts and supplies produced in 1909, primary batteries represented 501 per cent, storage batteries 40 per cent, and parts and supplies 99 per cent In 1899 the proportions were 241 per cent, 696 per cent, and 63 per cent, respectively -The number of \"dry\" primary batteries reported in 1909 was more than seventeen times the number reported in 1899, while their total value was over fourteen times as great lhe large increase in these batteries is chiefly due to the demand for such batteries for automobiles and for motor boats -period    The most extensive use of storage batteries is m connection with central station lighting plants and electric railways Electric lamps and lighting :fixtnresTable 21 shows the number and value of arc lamps manufactured in 1909, 1904, and 1899 -216 per cent, in the number of arc lamps manufactured and a decrease of $120,812, or 66 per cent, in their total value The decrease is accounted for by the fact that, while formerly arc lamps were used almost exclusively for street lighting and other purposes, the incandescent lamps have now replaced them to an appreciable extent The value of arc lamps was slightly greater ID 1909 than in 1904, owing to the introduction of more costly types, such as the flaming arc, etc Arc lamps are of two kinds, open and inclosed, either of which may be of the direct or of the alternating current type The inclosed lamps comprised by far the more important group, 96 per cent of the total number in 1909 beIDg of this kind Although the number of such lamps declined durIDg the decade, the total value increased The principal element in the superiority of the inclosed over the open type of arc lamp consists in the relation of the inner globe to the arc, whereby with a suitably restricted air inlet a long arc may be steadily maintained by a comparatively small current In the ordinary open arc lamp the carbon sticks burn away in 10 or 12 hours, but in an inclosed lamp the cored carbons used will last from 60 to 125 hours The small inner globe inclosing the carbon is of elongatecl oval shape, and is made of refractory glass, so as to resist successfully the intense heat of the arc -One of the largest special departments of electrical production is that of incandescent lamps The schedule of inquiry used at the census of 1909 called for statistics concerning incandescent lamps classified according to kind of filament used, while at previous censuses the classification of these lamps was according to their candlepower -ï Not reportid separately See Note 1 All :filament incandescent lamps reported ID 1904 and 1899 have been combined in Table 22 for comparison with the \"carbon :filament\" lamps reported for 1909, but it is probable that the group of lamps classified as \"above 16 candlepower\" in 1904 contained a number of highpower lamps of the tungsten, tautalum, and gem types -\"Glower lamps and parts\" and \"vacuum and vapor lamps\" were reported separately in 1904, but for 1909 the figures for such lamps are combined with those for gem and tantalum lamps The development of electric lamps of new forms and characteristics, requiring special :fixtures for their most efficient use, has greatly stimulated this branch of manufacture, especially during the fiveyear period 19041909 -The total value of the production of electric lighting :fixtures of all kinds increased 86 per cent from 1904 to 1909, and 634 per cent from 1899 to 1909 The total value of electric lighting :fixtures as shown in Table 23 represents only the value of those definitely reported as such, and is no doubt far less than the actual value of such products Large quantities of electric fixtures are manufactured in connection with the production of gas and other fixtures In some instances these are combIDation fbdures The total value of products for -The value of sockets, receptacles, bases, etc, shown separate from lighting fixtures in T11ble 14 was more than seven times as great in Hl09 as in 1899 -tmnsmittors and

of telephone apparatus produced of $1,604,341, or 101 per cent A very large proportion of other electrical apparatus, such as dynamos, motors, motorgenerator sets, insulated wires and cables, conduits, etc was required for the equipment of telephone excha~ges and in connecting the stations of individual telephone subscribers with central stations Only when due allowance is made for the value of these other cll1sses of products used in connection with the telephone systems can an idea be formed of the total value of telephone equipment manufactured Substantial increases were shown in the value of telephone transmitters and rnceivers and telephone parts and supplies produced, but for central switchboards th~re was 11 decrease of $2,755,538, or 535 per cent, durmg the five years Decreases were also shown in the value of complete sets of telephone instruments and of private exchange boards turned out in _1909 as compared with the value of those producedm 1904213 per cent for the former and 345 per cent for the latter -The products for Illinois show a decrease of more than a million dollars during the fiveyear period, and there were only 16 establishments in this state that reported the manu:facture of telephone apparatus and supplies in 1909, as compared with 29 engaged in such manufacture at the previous census -A considerable proportion o:f the total value of telephone equipment produced was that of parts and supplies This designation embraces a wide variety of parts, such as the signaling apparatus in magnetotelephone sets, main switchboards, the apparatus in use at the subscribers stations, and a large amount of miscellaneous apparatus -Insulated wire and oablesTable 26 shows the value of the production of insulated wire and cables in the different states during 1909 and 1904 and the total value only for 1899 -fhe value of insulated wire and cables :manufactured in 1909, 1904, and 1899 constituted the largest single item in the total value of electrical machinery, apparatus, and supplies reported, representing more than onefifth of the total value of products for the industry at each census -Of the $51,624,737 reported as the total value of insulated wire and cables, $40,250,572 was reported by establishments in the industry proper, and $11,374,165 by establishments engaged primarily in other industries Only a small number of the establishments in the industry proper drew the wire which they insulated, while of the establishments outside the industry reporting this product the greater number were engaged primarily in wire drawing -New Jersey, Illinois, and New York were the three states leading in this branch of the industry in 1909, roporting 638 per cent of the total value in that year and 661 per cent in 1904 -The indicating apparatus for central stations is practically uniform throughout the country, the leading types being voltmeters, ammeters, wattmeters, and watthour meters; but although one or two types are predominant among the consumers meters considerable variety exists, the kind used de_pending somewhat upon the system used in charging for the service -The testing and scientific apparatus constitutes a large group of appliances, including numerous types with hundreds of varieties, employed not only in practical work, but in laboratories and in physical and scientific research as well The value of the production of this apparatus decreased 453 per cent from 1904 to 1909 ∑ -Misceilaneous electrical appliancesReferring to Table 14, it will be seen that during the decade 18991909 there was a gain of only $10,682, or 47 per cent, ill the value of annunciators turned out, although theirnrnnufacture increased 267 per cent during the later fiveyear period The value of the output of electric clocks and time lnechanisms, on the other hand, increased 1668 per cent during tho decade, and the combined value of rheostats and resistances, heating, cooking, and welding apparatus, and electric flatirons, 290 per cent -Rheostats and resistances are a necessary adjunct to the use of heavy current for producing light and power, and large numbers are called for particularly in connection with the starting and regulation of electric motors, electric elevators, etc Many small resistances, however, are now used ill connection with delicate electrical instruments, as balance coils in telegraph service, or as shunting and ringing resistances in telephone circuits and relay signaling systems -The production of apparatus for electric heating, cooking, and welding, and

a class of appliances to which the general name \"circuit fittings\" has been given to designate that which is not part of the appliance itself, or part of the generating plant, or p11rt of the distributing circuits and pole lines, but which at the same time is required in order to enable contractors and the public to install such apparatus advantageously -The value of\" all other products\" in 1909, $39,691,708 (see Table 14), formed 163 per cent of the total value of products of the entire industry Under this heading are included dynamo parts ancl supplies to the value of ahnost a million dollars; custom work and repairing to the value of $5,692,543; and also carbons of all kinds, the Y!tluo of which can not be shown separately By far the largest item entering into the total for 1909, however, was one of $18,995,176, representing the v£Llue of miscellaneous or unclassified forms of electrical machinery, apparatus, and supplies These included electric mining machinery, automatic electric pumps, products based on late electrical inventions, and the making of special electrical apparatus to order; various devices and appliances for electrical use not designated on the schedule; panel and switch boxes, electric signs and flashers, electric flashlights; overhead trolley line material, trolley wheels, retrievers, gears, and pinions; various repair parts; insulating

engaged primarily in the construction or repair of ships and boats Data for shipyards owned lly the Federal Government were also collected, but these are shown separately and not includecl with the general totals for the industry or in those for all manufacturing industries combined Aside from establishments assigned to the shipbuilding industry, there are a number of establishments assigned to other industries which incidentally build or repair ships or boats, and statistics as to the number and tonnage of the vessels launched by such establishments u,re presented in connection with the tables giving similar statistics for establishments in the shipbuilding industry -In the statistics for the shipbuilding industry in the United States, the Bureau of the Census has distinguished between iron and steel ship building and wooden shipbuilding and boab building The former branch is :further subdivided so as to distinguish (1) establishments doing chiefly new construction work -on vessels of 5 tons or over and (2) establishments doing repair work exclusively Establishments in the woodenshipbuilding business are subdivided into four groups: (1) Establishments engaged primarily in new construction wolk on vessels of 5 tons or over; (2) establishments doing repair work only; (3) establishments engaged primarily in building boats of less th0,n 5 tons; and (Ll) establishments making masts, spars, and oars, and those engaged in rigging vessels These branches and subbranches of the industry are not, however, distinguished in the tables giving statistics by states, us to do so might result in the disclosure of individual operations There is some overlapping between the different branches and subbranches -Summary for the United States: 1909,Table 1 presents a summary of the statistics for establishments assigned to the shipbuilding industry, by branches and subbranches The table does not include data for est11blishments operated by the Federal Government or for establishments engaged primarily in other industries, and the same is true of all tnbles unless otherwise expressly stated -1 On vessels of 5 tons or more 2 Includes 1 establishment making boats under 5 tons Not tabula tad separately -It may be noted that a considerable part of the value of products for the shipbuilding industry represents the receipts for repair work The amount of such receipts for 1909, together with other statistics as to the products of the industry, is shown in Table 27 -While the number of establishments engaged in iron and steel shipbuilding is comparatively small, these establishments in 1909 gave employment to 695 per -cent of the total number of wage earners in the industry as a whole and contributed 676 per cent of the total value of products The average value of products per establishment for the industry as a whole in 1909 was $54,220; but for iron and steel shipbuilding the average was $936,175, as against $18,264 for wooden shipbuilding and boat building In this connection it should be noted that many small establishments engaged chiefly in building small boats or in the making of masts, spars, and oars and in rigging vessels are included in the total for wooden shipbuilding -In the iron and steel shipbuilding :industry the establishments engaged in new construction reported -861 per cent of the total value of products in 1909, 139 per cent being reported by yards doing repair work only In the wooden shipbuilding and boat building industry the proportions of the total value of products contributed by the establishments in the four subbranches were as follows: Establishments engaged in new construction on vessels of 5 tons or over, 568 per cent; those doing repair work only, -188 per cent; those constructing only boats of less than 5 tons, 23 per cent; and establishments making masts, spars, ancl oars and rigging vessels, 14 per cent It may be noted that both in iron and steel shipbuilding and in wooden shipbuilding the value of repair work done in establishments engaged principally in new construction was greater than that done by establishments engaged exclusively in repair work1 Comparison with earlier censusesTable 2 summarizes the statistics of the shipbuilding industry as a whole (exclusive of Government establishments and establishments assigned to other industries) for each census from 1869 to 1909, inclusive -1 This can be seen by a comparison of the figmes in Table 1 with the statistics of the total value of repairs to iron and steel and wooden vessels, as given in Table 28 -1 A minus

financial figures for 1869 are given in currency, which at that time was worth only about 80 cents, gold, to the dollar For strict comparison, therefore, these figures should be reduced about 20 per cent -The number of establishments in the industry in 1909, 1,353, was greater than the number shown for any prior census, with the exception of that for 187!), when 2,188 were reported While the number of establishments showed a decided increase from 1904 to 1909, most of the other impol1tant items showed decreases for this period Between 1899 and 1909 the average number of wage earners decreased 134 per cent and the value of products 16 per cent, but there was an increase of 27 per cent in the value added to matetials by manufacture This decrease in number of wage earners and value of products is due largely _to the dismantling of a large shipyard in Co~necticut after the completion of the steamships -Minnesota and Dalcota, to a decrease in construction in certain establishments in Pennsylvania and to a reduction in the output of one large establishment in -Government establishmentsTable 3 presents a comparative summary for the census years 1909 and 1904 of the general

classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees WOTked a greater or less number of hours -M::ire than fourfifths (839 per cent) of the wage earners employed in the industry in 1909 worked in establishments where the prevailing number of hours was from 54 to 60, inclusive, per week Of the seven gTOups shown in lable 9, the largest was that made up of wage eamers in establishments where the prevailing hours were 60 per week In four of the states -shown in the table, 54 hours per week was the most common time of employment reported, and

compared with 182 per cent in 1904 While corporations thus controlled less than onefil~h of the total number of establishments in 1909, the value of the products of these establishments represented 84 per cent of the total value of products for all establishments engaged in the industry But little change took place from 1904 to 1909 in the relative importance of the several foTms of ownership

Washington such establishments constituted only -117 per cent of the total number of establishments, reported 545 per cent of the value of products, and gave employment to 587 per cent of the wage earners Size of establishmentsTable 12 shows, for the shipbuilding industry as a whole and for each of its branches and subbranches, the average number of wage earners per establishment in 1909, together with the average value of products ond average value added by manufacture -This table brings out the great differences among the several branches and subbranches with respect to average size of establishments For all branches combined the average value of products per establishment decreased from $75,451 in 1904 to $54,220 in 1909, and the average value added by manufacture from $41,300 to $31,150 The average number of woge earners per establishment likewise shows a decrease from 46 in 1904 to 30 in 1909 The decrease in the average number of wage earners and in the average volue of products per establishment is due to two thingsa decline in that branch of the shipbuilding industry represented chiefly by the large establishments building vessels of over 5 tons, and an increase in that branch of the industry represented by the small establishments building boats of less than 5 tons There was an absolute decrease in the number of establishments and value of products for the former -or over In 1904 there were 16 establishments of trus class out of a total of 1,097 While such establishments represented a comparatively small proportion of the total number at both censuses, they reported 513 per cent of the value of products in 1909 and 581 per cent in 1904 -The increase between 1904 and 1909 in the number of establishments with products valued at less than $5,000 is doubtless attributable largely to the increase in the number of small concerns engaged in building motor boats and other small craft -Table 14 presents a classification of the est11blishments in the

current generated in the establishments -The total primary power used in the shipbuilding industry increased from 61,797 horsepower in 1899 to 88,063 in 1909 Most of this increase was in the power of steam engines and electric motors run by purchased current At each census steam was the principal source of power employed in the industry, but its relative importance has decreased since 1899 In that year steam power formed 905 per cent of the total primary power, as against only 831 per cent in 1909 There has been a marked increase, both absolutely and relatively, in the horsepower of gas and other internal combustion engines and of electric motors run by rented power The horsepower of electric motors run by current generated in the establishment increased from 6,202 in 1899 to 26,070 in 1909 -Table 18 shows, for 1909, the amount of each of the several kinds of power and of the di:fferent kinds of fuel used in each of 14 selected states -The states which in 1909 ranked highest with respect to the amount of power used in the shipbuilding industry were New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, and Michigan in the order named The total horsepower reported for these seven states in 1909 was 60,448, or 686 per cent of the total for the United States Steam was by far the most important power in all of the states shown except Maine, which reported a larger amount of rented electric power than of any other kind The largest amount of steam power is shown for New Jersey1 and the largest amount of gasengine power, as well as of rented electric power, for New York -sumecl in 1909 California reported 60,511 barTels of oil, or 67 3 per cent of the total quantity of that kind of fuel consumed in the industry, while Ohio reported -972 per cent of all the

AND EQUIPMENT, -Number of vessels launchedThe special schedule used in collecting the statistics for shipbuilding required a detailed statement of the number, kind, and tonnage of vessels launched during the year, and a statement of the value of the diflerent kinds of work clone during the year, together with special information regarding the equipment of the shipyards -Table 19 shows the number and gross tom1age of all vessels launched dur:iJ1g the census years 1909, 1904, and 1899, distinguishing three classes of establishments reporting In many cases, a large part of the work on vessels launched during the census year was performed during prior years and, conversely, much work was clone during each census year on vessels not yet ready for launching at the end of the year -The decline in shipbuilding during the fiveyear period between 1904 and 1909 is clearly brought out by the fact that for all classes of vessels of 5 tons and over there was a decrease, with the exception of motor boats, which formed a very small part of the total number reported The decline in the iron and steel branch of the industry is no doubt due to the decrease in Government work done in private shipyards The increase in the number of small boats constructed is perhaps the most noteworthy fact brought out by the table Motor boats of more than 5 -In explanation of a number of the tables wherein tonnage is shown, it should be stated that the gross tonnage of a ship is the total internal capacity, expressed in \"tons\" of 100 cubic feet, while the net tonnage is the portion available f01 cargo and passengersin other words, the earning capacity of the shipexpressed on a similar basis By methods defined by law, now practically uniform for the leading maritime nations, measurements are made to ascertain the capacity of the vessel in cubic feet and the result is divided by 100, the quotient being the gross tonnage of the vessel Net tonnage is ascertained in the case of sailing vessels by deducting from the gross tonnage the space set apart for the quarters of the -master and crew and for minor purposes of navigation and in the case of steam vessels, by deducting fro~ the gross tonnage the space required for_ the quarters of the officers and crew, ~nd_for the bo~crs, machinery, and coal bunkers Differmg from either of these is the displacement tonnage of a vessel, which is merely the weight of the volume of water displaced, or the weight of the vessel a~d its load The tonnage of war vessels of the Umted Stat~s Navy as given is always displacement tonnage and IS the weight of the vessels m ordinary cruising condition While gross tonnage and displacement tonnage are not by any means the same, it was necessary to combine the tonnage of vessels whose capacity is reckoned in one way with that of vessels whose capacity is reckoned by the other method in order to obtain a total which should represent approximately the total tonnage launched during the year -In the tables which follow, gross tonnage is shown for 1909 unless otherwise specified It is impossible to indicate for censuses previous to 1904 the proportion of displacement tonnage included in the figures,, but owing to the fact tha,t the building of Government warships hus only recently become prominent in the industry, it is probable that for censuses prior to 1899 displacement tonnage formed a comparatively small proportion of the totals shown 111 the tables -Table 20 gives, by states, the total number and gross tonnage of all vessels of 5 tons and over launched in 1909 by private establishments in the shipbuilding industry -Of the total number of vessels of over 5 tons launched in 1909, New York built 195 per cent and Pennsylvania 129 per cent Washington ranked third in number of vessels launched Ohio, however, led all other states in aggregate tonnage, with Ncw York, New Jersey, and Virginia following in the order named -Table 21 shows, by states, for 1909, the number and the gross and net tonnage of steam vessels of 5 tons and over launched in private shipyards -Of the states for which totals are presented, Ohio, Vlichigan, and New Jersey led in the order named, and combined reported 126,390 gross tons, or 539 per cent of the total for steam vessels of 5 tons and over launched in private yards in 1909 The steam vessels launched in these three states also showed -the largest average tonnage per vessel Ohio, the leading state in total tonnage, also led m respect to average gross tonnage per vessel with an average for the 16 steamships launched in 1909 of 3,610 tons per vessel \"All other states\" include several which had a gross tonnage greater than that shown for some of the states for which totals could be shown without the disclosure of individual operations, and of these Virginia was the most important -The number and the gross and net tonnage of motor vessels of 5 tons and over, launched in private shipyards in 1904 and 1909, ar~ shown, by

Washington reported the largest number of boats of this class launched in 1909, with New York -During each intercensal period covered by this table a great decrease took place in the number and tonnage of sailing vessels launched The aggregate gross tonnage decreased from 80,294 in 1899 to 17,459 in 1909, or 783 per cent With the exception of Florida and Washington, which were reported separately in 1909 for the first time, and Maryland, every state showed a decrease during the decade in number and tonnage of this type of vessel launched -The state of Maine, which reported 599 per cent of the total tonnage in 1904, was still in 1909 the leading state, with 489 per cent of the total tonnage of this type of vessel launched The gross tonnage for Maine in 1909 was more than four times that shown for the second state, Massachusetts -Both classes of vessels show large decreases in tonnage from 1904 to 1909, the decrease shown by wooden vessels being the greater, so that iron

power boats All but three of the states named in the tableIowa, Minnesota, and Virginiashowed increases from 1904 to 1909 in the number of small power boats constructed -Value of work done during census yearThe construction of a vessel of the larger type frequently requires more than one year to complete In a number of instances work on vessels that were :finished during the census year had been started in previous years, and in some cases vessels upon which work was started during the census year were not :finished during that year For this reason the office did not require the shipbuilders to report the value of the vessels launched, but only the value of the work done during the census year and the amount received for repair work -For the smaller vesselsmotor boats and those having a capacity of less than 5 tonsthe value of work done during the year corresponds very closely with the value of the craft launched rhus the value of the work clone on boats of less than 5 gross tons in 1909, which is shown in Table 27 as amounting to $4,891,408, corresponds very closely with the value of the craft of this type -Table 27 shows the value of the construction work done,

agriculture Agri0ultural implements in general are divided :into four groups, namely, implements of cultivation, seeders and planters, harvesting implements, and seed separators These groups in turn are subdivided into numerous classes The implements of cultivation :include chiefly cultivators, harrows, and plows; seeders and planters include seeders, listers, planters, and drills; harvesting implements include harvesters, hay rakes, forks, stackers, tedders, mowers, and reapers; -and seed separatorsinclude thrashers, cornhuskers, corn shellers, and fanning mills There are also certain mis∑ ~ellaneous types of agricultural implements which can not be assigned to any one of the four general groups -The increasing acreage under cultivation and the difficulty of procuring form hands in the United States, together with the demand for agricultural implements -in foreign markets, have not only brought about a vast growth in the industry but have no doubt been influential factors in the development of more expensive and intricate agricultmal machinery -1 A minus sign () denotes decrease Where percentages are omitted, comparable figures are not available -A considerable part of the total value of products represents the value of products other than agricultural implements So far as these products could be identified, their value in 1909 amounted to $11,477,829, this :figure covering products primarily manufactured in other industries, as follows: Foundry and 93426∞1321 -On the other hand, agricultural implements were reported in 1909 to the value of $2,989,276 by establishments engaged primarj)y in the manufacture of other products -Salaried employees were included to some extent with wage earners at the earlier censuses This fact explains, at least in part, the decrease in the number of wage earners shown for the decade 18791889 The statistics for 1899 are more nearly comparable with the figures for 1909 than are those for the earlier censuses Between these two years the average number of wage earners increased 3,969, or 85 per cent -Summary, by statesTable 2 summarizes the more important statistics of the industry by states, the states being arranged according to the value of products reported for 1909 Some states for which data can not be shown separately rank higher than some named in the table -Although the manufacture of agricultural implements in 1909 was reported from 39 states, 827 per cent of the total value of products for the industry was reported by the 6 leading states Illinois) with a value of products in 1909 representing 391 per cent of the total, is by far the most important state in the industry, ranking first at the censuses of -1909 and 1904, not only in value of products, but also in the average number of wage earners employed and in value added by manufacture New York ranked second among the states in value of products in 1909, reporting 102 per cent of the total, and third in average number of wage earners, with 113 per cent of the total, while Ohio was third in value of products and second in number of wage earners Among the leading states in the industry, Indiana shows the most ∑ decided gain in rank, having advanced from sixth place in 1904, as determined byvalue of products, to fourth place in 1909, from fifth place to fourth in average number of wage earners, and from sixth to second in value added by manufacture Wisconsin and Michigan each fell back one place in rank in average number of wage earners, value of products, and value added by manufacture -In general, the states had in 1909 the same, or practically the same, rank in the number of wage eaimers employed and in the value added by manufacture as in the value of products -1 Percentages are based on figures

classilication of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -The average number of wage earners in each state, for 1909, 1904, and 1899, is given in Table 17 The average number distributed by sex and age is not shown for the individual states, but Table 18 gives such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, or the nearest representative day Female wage earners 16 years of age and over were reported from only 15 states; the largest number, 264, was reported for the state of Illinois, and the next largest number, 142, for Indiana These 2 states combined reported 602 per cent of all the wage earners -of this class in the industry The few wage earners under 16 years of age were fairly well distributed among the states  -In order to comp are the distribution of the persons engaged in the industry in 1909 according to occupational status with that in 1904, it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is:made in Table 4 -Table 5 shows the average number of wage earners in the industry distributed according to age, and in the case of those 16 years of age and over, according to sex, for 1909, 1904, and 1899 The number of women and children employed was so small that the increase from 1899 to 1909 has little significance -Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 6gives the number of wage earners employed in the industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 for the 13 states in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed during the year -1 lhc month of maximum employment for each state is indicated by boldface figures and thut of minimum employment by italic figures -In the industry as a whole, as well as for the individual states, the greatest activity occurred during the winter and spring months, and for most of the states shovm in the table the least number of wage earners was reported for some month of the summer or early fall For Indiana, the fourth state in respect to value of products, however, the least number of wage earners was reported for January -The months of maximum and minimum employment for 1909, and the number of wage earners reported for these months, are given for a larger number of states in -Table 18  Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 7 the wage earners in the industry have been classified according -to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or less number of hours -Georgia Illinoisïïïïï Indianaïïï Iowa Kentucky :Michigan ïïïïïï Minnesotaïïïï NewYork Ohioïïïïïïïïïïïïïï Pennsylvaniaïï T~ess~eïï -Practically all (948 per cent) of the wage earners employed in the industry in 1909 were in establishments embraced in the three groups where the prevailing hours were from 54 to 60, :inclusive, per week Oqly 4 9 per cent were employed :in establishments where the prevailing hours were less than 54 per week, and threetenths of 1 per cent of the total in establishments where the prevailing hours were more than 60 per week Of the seven groups shown in Table 7, the largest was that made up of the wage earners in esta b-lishments where the prevailing hours were between 54 and 60 per week, such wage earners constituting 545 per cent of the total number This group was the most important7 likewise, in each of the five leading states in the industry as measured by value of productsIllinois, New York, Ohio, Indiana, and Wisconsin In California and Michigan, however, the wage earners in establishments where the prevailing hours of labor per week were 54 formed the largest group, and in the remaining states the largest group was that made up of the wage earners m establishments where the prevailing hours were 60 per week -Character of ownershipTable 8 presents statistics with respect to the character of ownership of the establishments engaged in the industry in the United -Table 9 gives statistics for establishments classi£ed according to form of ownership for each state, with the exception of Kentucky, for which more than 500 wage earners were reported Kentucky is omitted in order to avoid the disclosure of individual operations -NorEIn some states, 1n order to avoid_disclosing the returns for lndivldu_al establishments, the _ilgures for one group have qeen consolidated with those for establishments under some other form of ownership In such cases an (X) is placed ill the column from which the :figures have been omitted and the tlgures for the group with wbioh they have been combined are printed in italics The figures for establishments under firm ownership include those for one establishment under cooperative-There are considerable variations among the different states in the relative importance of the establishments operated by individuals, :firms, and corporations, respectively Thus in Illinois the establishments controlled by corporations constituted 633 per cent of the total number of establishments, gave employment to 993 per cent of the wage earners, and reported 987 per cent of the total value of products In Pennsylvania, on the other hand, establishments under corporate ownership controlled only 361 per cent M the establishments, gave employment to 658 per cent of the wage earners, and contributed 641 per cent of the total value of products -Size of establishmentsTable 10 presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for establishments grouped according to the value of their products -42 per cent in 1904 While such establishments represented a comparatively small proportion of the total number at both censuses, they reported 643 per cent of the total value of products in 1909 and 522 per cent in 1904 On the other hand, the small establishmentsthat is, those manufacturing products valued at less than $20,000constituted more than onehalf (513 per cent) of the total number of establishments in 1909, -but the value of their products amounted to only 15 per cent of the total The corresponding proportions for these establishments at the census of 1904 were -471 per cent and 17 per cent, respect1vely More than ninetenths of the output of all establishments in the industry, as measured by value, was turned out in both years by those having products valued at $100,000 or over, such establishments reporting 938 per cent of the total value of products in 1909 and 908 per cent in 1904 NUMBER OF-Classification by number of wage earnersTable 11 classifies the establishments in the 13 leading states according to the number of wage earners employed -but there was an increase in the relative importance of power generated by gas and other internalcombustion engines The most noticeable gain, however, was in rented electric power, which :increased from 1,100 horsepower in 1899 to 15,684 horsepower, or more than fourteen times as much, in 1909 Rented electric power formed 156 per cent of the total primary power in 1909, as compared with 43 per cent in 1904, and -16 per cent in 1899 The number and horsepower of electric motors used for distributing power by means of current generated in the establishments in the industry also show a very decided increase -Table 13 shows, for 1909, the amount of each of the several kinds of power and of the different kinds of fuel used in the industry in the 13 leading states -In 1909 Illinois, New York, Ohio, Indiana, and Wiswas the most important form of power in all of the consin together reported 75,206 horsepower, or 748 states shown separately except California, where per cent of∑ the aggregate for the industry Stearn rented electric power was used to a greater extent -than any other form of power The largest amount of steam power, 31,575 horsepower, represent:ing 442 per cent of the total, was reported by Illinois, and the largest amount of water power, 3,100 horsepower, by Indiana Illinois reported by far the largest amount of rented electric power, 5,535 horsepower, or more than onethird of the total for the United States Of the power generated by gas and other internalcombustion eng:ines, the greatest amount, 1,562 horsepower, was reported for Ohio -Fuel consumedBituminous coal was the principal class of fuel used in the industry, 550,085 short tons being consumed during 1909, of which amount 287,554 tons, or 523 per cent1 were used mIllinois The largest quantity of anthracite coal, 5,651 long tons, or more than onethird of the total for the :industry, was reported for New York Gas and oil were used to a considerable extent, by far the largest quantity of gas being reported for Ohio, and of oil for Illinois -The value of products increased from $101,207,428 in 1899 to $146,329,268 in 1909, or 446 per cent The value of products in 1909 included a large amount ($48,690,082, or onethlrd of the total value of products for the industry) which represented the value of products that could not be classified with either of the four general groups of products Of this amount, $11,477,829, as stated in the discussion of Table 1, was found to represent products other than agricultural implements, leaving $37,212,253 which it was impracticable to account for in detail Much of this represents the value of parts and attachments of agricultural implements, traction engines, hay presses, tobacco presses, manure spreaders, wagons, cane mills, windmills, wheelbarrows, dairy machinery, road scrapers, water tanks, evaporators, and various kinds of hand tools, like scythes, shovels, and spades Thus, although manyof these products are directly associated with agriculture, t,here are∑ many which ~i:o common to agricultural and to other pursuits> !1nd∑still others which are not generally used ~s agricultural ∑ implements ∑ ∑ -A comparison of the numbers of the various classes of agricultural machinery reported at the several censuses is of little value, since each class includes a considerable variety of implements and the makeup of the class may change from census to census, either by reason of improvements in the machinery or by reason of changes in the type of machinery most extensively used -Principal classes of products, by states,Table 15 shows, by states, the values reported for the four m0,in groups of agricultural implements for 1909 and 1904  Statistics of this kind are not available for 1899 -The value reported for implements of cultivation shows an increase of $4,638,070, or 152 per cent, between 1904 and 1909 Illinois was the leading state in the manufacture of this class of agricultural implements, reporting approximately twofilths of -the toteI value of such implements for the United States at both censuses, while Indiana ranked second -Too principal statistics secured by the census inquiry concerning establishments engaged in the manufacture of

for the presentation of the statistics at the census of 1909, includes wholesale slaughtering 11nd meat packing establishments, public abuttoirs, and establishments making a specialty of manufacturing sal1sage It does not include the retail butchering establishments It is impossible, however, to draw a hard and fast line between the wholesale and retail business The operations of butchers, whose main business was slaughtering for the retail trade but who also disposed of considerable quantities of meat at wholesale, were intended to be included, and the reports for such establishments ordinarily covered both their retail and their wholesn,le business Establishments properly included in the wholesale industry at one census might, on account o:f changes in the character of their business, properly be omitted at another census, although still in operation; and even at the same census establishments of identical chamcteristics may have been treated differently by the special agents in different sections of the country The statistics for the industry, however, may be accepted as representing practico1ly n,ll important establishments engaged wholly, or chiefly, in slaughtering and meat packing, in sl:aughtering, and in the manufacture of sausage for the wholesofo trade ï -The present report distinguishes three classes of establishments: (1) Those whose chief products are cured and packed meats; (2) those whose chief products are frosh meats; and (3) those whose chief product is stiusage In compiling the statistics each establishment was assigned to one of the three groups according to its product of chief value Many of the establishments engaged chiefly in meat packing also slaughter, and although all establishments classed as engaged in \"slaughtermg\" are those that have fresh meat for their product of chief value, there are some of them that do a limited amount of meat packing also So many establishments in the industry engage in two or -ïeven all three of these branches combined that the overlapping of products makes advisable the presentation in most of the tables of the totals for the combined industries only The :figures regurding cost of materials and value of products in tho various tables of this bulletin contain a considerable amount of duplication Those establishments, for example, which are engaged in meat packing only, or in making sausage only, use as ma-terials the fresh meat produced by the slaughtering branch of the industry Dressed meat valued at $93,409,286 was reported in 1909 as among the materials purchased by the establishments in the industry This may be said to represent roughly the amount of duplication involved in cost of materials and in value of products as repo1∑tecl for the combined industry In the statistics of \"value added by manufacture\" this duplication is almost entirely cliininrttetl -Summary for the industry: 1909Table 1 presents a summary of the statistics for the slaughtering and meat packing industry as a whole and for each of its branches for 1900 -Table 1 , ESTATlLISHMENTS ENGAGED lRHIAlULY INlotal for the industry Slaughteringand meat packing, Slaughter!ng, not including ment pneking The manufnctme of sausage -∑ employed 907 per cent of the total number of wage earners and contributed products to the value of $1,204,248,578, or 879 per cent of the total for the industry as a whole Although establishments engaged chiefly in slaughtering formed approximately onethird (344 per cent) of the total number, they -employed only 72 per cent of the total number of wage earners, and the value of their products represented but 11 per cent of the total for the entire industry The 420 establishments engaged chiefly in the manufacture of sausage reported 21 per cent of the wage earners and contributed 11 per cent of the total value of products In the case of establishments engaged primarily in meat packing, the cost of materials equaled 88 per cent of the value of products; in the case of those engaged primarily in slaughtering, -874 per cent; and of those making sausage, 758 per cent Of the 656 establishments in 1909 doing slaughtering and meat packing, 159 did no slaughtering, but were engaged exclusively in packing meats Of the 565 establishments engaged chiefly in slaughtering, 31 were abattoirs in which animals were slaughtered for others, including both the wholesale and retail meat dealers; the value of products for the latter class of establishments represents chiefly the amount received for slaughtering The conditions under which these two classes of establishments arc operated differ so materially from those prevailing in the other establishments in this industry that it has seemed best to show the statistics for them n1 a separate table -Comparison with earlier censuses,The statistics relative to the manuiacture of sausage were not shown separately prior to 1889 Statistics for this branch of the industry may have been included with the figures for slaughtering and meat packing or may have been omitted from the census reports altogether At the census of 1849 tho industry as a whole was called \"pork and beef packing,\" and in that of 1859 it was included under the designation of \"provisions\" In 1869 the statistics of the industry were collected under four headings, namely, \"meat packed, beef,\" meat packed, pork,\" \"meat cwed and packed, not specified,\" and \"butchering,\" while the designation used in 1879 was \"slaughtering and meat packing, not including retitil butchering\" In 1889, 1899, and 1904 separate :figmes were secm∑ecl for \"slaughtering and meat packing, wholesale,\" \"slaughtering, wholesale not including meat packing,\" and \"sausage\" Th; designation \"slaughtering and meat packing,\" used in 1909, covers the three classes of establishments for which separate statistics were published in 1904 and -at the two censuses preceding Even a cursory examination of the titles applied to the industry at successive censuses makes evident the fact that different classes of establishments were included at different times, although the totals for the censuses from 1889 to 1909, inclusive, are fairly comparable The number of establishments in the industry as a whole increased 20 per cent from 1889 to 1909 The decrease shown for the period from 1889 to 1899 was due probably to the inclusion at the earlier census of some small establishments which were omitted from the reports for subsequent years Th~ number of wage earners more than doubled during the 20year period, while the value of products increased 1427 per cent rrnd the cost of materials 1491 per cent -Table 3 summarizes the statistics of the slaughtering ancl meat packing industry as a whole for

serve to show in a general way the great development of the industry The :financial statistics for 1869 11re given in currency, which at that time was worth only about 80 cents, gold, to the dollar For -strict comparison, therefore, these figures should be reduced about 20 per cent Comparisons with earlier censuses for the three -branches of the industryTable 5 shows the statistics for the three branches of the industry separately for 1909 and 1899 and the percentage of increase in each during the decade -The slaughtering and meat packing branch of the industry so far overshadows tho other branches that, although the percentages of increase from 1899 to 1900 were, on the whole, smaller, the actual amount of i11crease for this branch was much greater than for the other two branches combined -Summary, by statesTable 6 summarizes the more important statistics for the industry as a whole by states, the states being arranged according to the value of products reported for 1900 The states shown in this table are given their actual ranking among all states, the rank of certain states for which data can not be presented being higher than that of some named in the table In considering the rank in value of products it should be borne in mind that there may be more duplication in value reported for some states than in that reported for others -The slaughtering and meat packing industry is well distributed throughout the United States, establishments being reported in 1909 from 43 states and from the District of Columbia Illinois is by for the most important state in the industry It was surpassed in number of establishments, however, by New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, the establishments in Illinois being, in general, much larger than those i11 any other -state lhe value of slaughtering and meat paeking products in Illinois increased 35 per cont during the decade, but tl10 relative importance of the state in the industry declined during this period, the

establishments Few cha11ges took place d~ring the :fiveyear period in the ranld11g, as determined by value of products, of the more important states in the slaughtering and meat packing industry Iowa, Ohio, and Iexas advanced in rank, while Massachusetts, California, and Minnesota declined The advances in the ranking of the more important states were due to tho great increase in the meatpacking branch of the industry In Iowa the wholesale slaughtering branch of the industry actually declined Of the 10 leading states, Ohio showed the most rapid increase in value of products during the period

slaughtering and meat packing industry as a whole and in each ?f the three branches, classified according to occupat10nal status and sex, and in the case of wage earners, according to age also It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -32 per cent, proprietors and officials; and 15,474, or 142 per cent, clerks, this class including other subordinate salaried employees The grouping of persons engaged according to occupational status differs widely in the different branches of the industry In the slaughtering and meat packing branch 835 per cent of the total were wage earners; 2 per cent, proprietors and officials; and 145 per cent, clerks In the slaughtering branch 756 per cent were wage earners; 116 per cent, proprietors and officials; and -128 per cent, clerks; while of those engaged in sausage making only 698 per cent were wage earners and 95 per cent clerks, while 207 per cent were proprietors and officials Of the total number of persons engaged in the :industry as a whole, 101,303, or 932 per cent, were males Of the females, 766 per cent were wage earners, almost all of whom were in the meat packing branch of the industry, where they are employed in the packing and shipping of canned goods Males constituted 997 per cent of the wage earners in the slaughtering branch, 964 per cent in sausage manufacture, and 93l per cent in meat packing -The average number of wage earners in each state for 1909, 1904, and 1899 is given in Table 30 The average number distributed by sex and ago is not shown for the individuaJ states, but Table 31 gives, for 1909, such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, or the nearest representative day -In order to compare the distribution of the persons engaged in the industry n1 1909 according to occupational status with that in 1904 it is necessary to use the cln,ssi:fication employed at the earlier census (see Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 8 -Table 9 shows the average number of wage earners in the industry as a whole distributed according to age, and in the caso of those 16 years of age and over according to sax, for 1909, 1904, and 1899 The table shows practically no change from census to census in the proportion of men employed, hut the proportion of women has increased and that of children hn,s decreased -Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 10 gives day) of each month during the year 1909, for the 19 the number

employment for each sinle is indicated by boldface figures nnd that of minimum employment by italic figures -The totals for the industry as a whole show that there was little seasonal variation in employment The largest number of wage earners reported for any month in 1909 was 96,234 for December, and the smallest number 84,558 for April, the minimum number being equal to 879 per cent of the maximum In 1904 the maximum number, 85,620, was shown for December, and the minimum number, 61,303, for July, the latter number being egual to 716 per cent of the former In no state of importance in the industry do great fluctuations in employment appear The months of maximum and minimum employment for 1909, and the number of wage earners reported for these months, arc given for n, larger number of states in Table 31 ∑ -Table 12 presents statistics with respect to the character of ownership of establishments of the slaughtering and meat packing industry as a whole -In 1909, of the total number of establishments, 297 per cent were under corporate ownership, as compared with 244 per cent in 1904 While corporations thus controlled approximately threetenths of the total number of establishments in 1909, the value of the products of these establishments represented nearly ninetenths of the total for the industry -Table 13 gives statistics for establishments classified according to form of ownership for the 10 states in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed during the year The three establishments under unclassified forms of ownership have -In 1909, 4,906 wage earners, or 55 per cent of the total, were employed in establishments under individual ownership; 4,483, or 5 per cent, in those under :firm ownership (including those under \"other\" ownership); and 80,339, or 895 per cent, in those under corporate ownership Considerable variation existed among the different states in the relative importance of establishments under the different forms of ownership In Illinois, for example, establishments controlled by corporations constituted 495 per cent of the total number, gave employment to 961 per cent of the wage earners, and reported 962 per cent of the value of products In Maryland, on the other hand, corporations controlled only 148 per cent of the establishments, and these establishments gave employment to 572 per cent of the wage earners and contributed 532 per cent of the value of products -Classification by value of productsTable 14 presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for establishments in the industry as a whole, grouped

cent, The percentages of total expenses represented by the several classes of expense are shown for each of the three branches of the industry iJ1 Table 16 -The cost of materials constituted the principal item of expense in the slaughtering and meat packing industry, forming a very large proportion of the total in each of the three branches of the industry Marked variations are shown in the proportions represented by the different classes of expense in the various states (See Table 31) Among 21 principal states, the proportion of the total expenses represented by salaries ranged from 1 per cent in Kentucky, to 23 per cent in Colorado; that represented by wages from -34 per cent in Missomi to 5 per cent in Oregon; that represented by cost of materials from 89 per cent in Oregon to 93 per cent in Kentucky; and that represented by miscellaneous expenses from 2 per cent in Kentucky to 45 per cent in Nebraska \\x0cMANUFACTURES -as in 1899, the proportion which it formed of the total advancing from 13 per cent to 72 per cent during the decade The number and horsepower of electric motors used for distributing power by means of current generated in the same establishment also show a very great increase -Table 18 shows, for 1909, the amount of the several kinds of power and of the different kinds of fuel used in 19 of the leading states -In 1909 seven statesIllinois, Kansas, New York, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, Missouri, and Texastogether reported 142,224 horsepower, or 681 per cent of the aggregate for the industry In every state shown in the table, except Washington, where rented electric power represented t>l4 per cent of the total, steam power was the most important kind of prin1ary power -much larger quantities of anthractie than of bitumin~ ous coal were consumed In several of the states con~ siderable quantities of gas were used -In the slaughtering and meat packing industry the cost of materials forms a larger proportion (913 per cent) of tho total expenses than in most other industries, owing to tho fact that the processes of manufacture are comparatively simple and inexpensive -No statistics were secured concerning the quantity of meat or other materials used by establishments engaged in the manufacture of sausage, and the cost of materials for this branch of the industry is included in the amount shown for \"all other materials\" in Table -626 per cent; and of hogs, $205,013,354, or 736 per cent Thus hogs showed the greatest absolute, and calves the greatest relative, increase both in number and in cost during the 10 years In the cost of \"all other\" animals slaughtered is included a large expenditure for poultry, many of the establishments doing an extensive business in this line -Table 20 shows a decrease for the 10year period 18991909 in the average dressed weight of beeves, hogs, sheep, and lambs The average weight of calves increased -Total number of animals slaughtered for foodThe number of animals killed in wholesale slaughtering and meat packing establishments obviously represents only a portion of the total number of animals slaughtered for food In order to secure this total, as required by a special amendment to the act providing for the Thirteenth Census, the enumerators obtained reports from retail slaughterhouses, and to these figures were added the statistics regarding the number of animals slaughtered on farms and ranges, secured through the census of agriculture Table 21 shows the total number of animals reported as slaughtered for food in 1909 -1 The inquiry conoomlng the animals slaughtered on farms called for the number of \"sheep\" and \"goats\" without expressly stating that lambs and kids were to be -Included It is possible, therefore, that tho pumber of shee11 reported m!IY not Include all the Iambs, or the number of goats mclude all the kids The omJSsIOns, if any, were presumably few -The bulk of the slaughtering in 1909 was done by wholesale establishments, almost twothirds of the animals being killed in such plants The larger number of calves, however, were slaughtered by retail establishments It is notable that a larger number of hogs than of other animals were slaughtered on farms and ranges Such animals can be slaughtered in the open with very little preparation and very few implements, and the edible offal is easily handled It should also be borne in mind that a great many farmers have their own smokehouses and make a practice of curing the pork produced on their farms The number of hogs slaughtered on farms and ranges represented 828 per cent of all animals slaughtered on farms and 289 per cent of the total number of hogs slaughtered in the United States -Illinois ranked first in 1909, l 904, and 1899 in the slaughtering of each ofthe kinds of animals for which figures are given Kansas ranked second in 1909 in the slaughter of beeves and hogs, and New York in the slaughter of calves and sheep and lambs A comparison 0£ the statistics for 1909 and 1899 indicates a shifting of the slaughter of beeves nearer -The number of animals of the various kinds slaughtered in 1909, both in wholesale and retail slaughterhouses n,ncl on farms and ranges, is given by states in Table 23 -ANIMALS SLAUGHTERED FOR FOOD, IN WHOLESALE AND RETAIL SLAUGHTERHOUSES AND ON FARMS AND RANGES, BY STATES: 1909 -Summary for the United StatesTable 24 shows the quantity

Includes fert!lizers only Figures not available for fertilizer materials ï Includes pe!Ls purcbnsed for wool pulling There were increases during the decade 1899 to 1909 both in quantity and in value of all the products enu-merated in Table 24, with the exception of salted or cured beef and salted pork, each of which showed a decrease in quantity The largestrelative increase in value is shown for fresh veal, 225 per cent \"All other fresh meat,\" which includes goat and kid meat and dressed poultry, and also edible offalsuch as hearts, tongues, livers, heads, etcincreased 1098 per cent in value during the decade -Of the products other than meats, lard is the most important, showing an increase during the decade of -219 per cent in quantity and of 1198 per cent in value No statistics relative to the manufacture of oleomargarine in slaughtering and meat packing establishments were collected at censuses prior to 1909 Of the total number of hides taken from animals slaughtered by establishments in the slaughtering and meat packing industry, approximately 8,115,000 were cattle hides and 1,445,000 calfskins In addition, a large number of calfskins were sold on the carcasses From 1899 to 1909 the quantity of wool taken from animals slaughtered by establishments in this industry increased 658 per cent, and the value 1497 per cent All products not specifically called for on the schedule are included Ullder \"all other products\" Among these are lard substitutes and compound lard, sausage casings, scrapple, pickled tripe, pigs feet, poultry and animal food, hogs hair, ice, and also special kinds of cars for the transportation of products -Table 25 shows the proportion which the quantity reported for each of these products formed of the combined total at the three censuses, and also the percentage of increase in the quantity of each during the period -The quantity of pork produced was practically the same in 1909 as in 1899 The three other kinds of meat listed in the table, on the other hand, increased considerably, so that, although pork still held first place, it showed a pronounced decline in importance as compared with the others The quantity of veal reported almost trebled during the decade -Subsidiary products,Many establishments in the :slaughtering and meat7packing industry make large ∑quantities of subsidiary products, some of which form the chief products of other industries distinguished by the census A number of the large concerns kept -ïseparate accounts for the branches or departments making certain of these subsidiary products, especially for those making fertilizers and soap, and∑in such cases separate reports were secured for these departments, which were treated as individual establishments The total value of the products of these separately reported departments of slaughtering and meat packing establishments amounted in the aggregate to $32,661,669 In cases, however, where it was impraoticable to obtain separate statistics for these subsidiary products they were included in the general operations of the slaughtering and meat packing industry In Table 26 is shown the value of several of these products manufactured in establishments reported as engaged primarily in the production of the same, and also the value of such products reported by the establishments in the industry -The total value of products shown for establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of the five dasses of products shown in lable 26 amounted to $247,509,910 This includes products to the value of $:H,490,269 manufactured by separately reported departments of slaughtering and meat packing establishments The total value of these products reported as produced in the slaughtering and meat packing industry amounted to $151,232,489 If to this amount be added the $21,490,269 included in the figures for the five industries mentioned, the value of these products actually produced by the slaughtering and meat packing establishments amounted to $172,722,758, or -433 per cent of the total value of such products, shown in Table 26 The value of oleomargarine manufactured in slaughtering and meat packing establishments was nearly threefomths as great as that made in establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of this product, while the value of lard m11nufactured by slaughtering and meat packing establishments was over 13 times the value of that produced in establishments or departments of the same reported as lard renderjng plants -The prominence of Illinois in the industry is illustrated by the fact that this state ranked first at each of the last three censuses in output of each of the specified products named in fable 27, with the single exception that New York produced more veal than Illinois in 1899 The percentages of the total output reported by Illinois in 1909 and 1899, respectively, were as follows: Beef, 272 and 357 per cent; veal, 203 and -209 per cent; mutton, 318 and 369 per cent; fresh pork, 196 and 337 per cent; salt pork, 332 and 381 per cent; hams, 196 and 291 per cent; shoulders, 229 and 189 pei∑ cent; lard, 32A and 365 per cont; and hides, 269 and 383 per cent The largest absolute increase in fresh beef for the decade reported by any state was 234,640,370 pounds in Kansas, while Texas showed the largest relative gain The largest absolute increase in the production of veal reported for the period by any state was 33;685,297 pounds in Illinois, followed by an increase of 28,335,074 pounds in Texas The largest absolute increase in output of mutton for the decade was reported for Kansas, and the greatest percentage of increase (2398 per cent) for Ohio Illinois, although reporting an output of fresh pork more than twice as great in 1909 as that reported by any other state, showed a decrease of 107,479,929 pounds in output of this product during the decade Iowa reported the largest absolute increase, and Texas the largest relative gain from 1899 to 1909 Most of the states reported rather large decreases in the production of salted pork, only a little more than twothirds as much salt pork (694 per cent) being reported in 1909 as was produced in 1899 Only four of the states in the table showed increases between 1899 and 1909Texas showing the largest relative gain, 582 per cent The largest percentage of increase in output of hams (3558 per cent) was for Minnesota, and the largest absolute gain was reported by Kansas In the production of shoulders, bacon, and sides, Wisconsin showed the largest relative gain (375 per cent) and Iowa the greatest absolute increase In the production of lard Texas showed the largest gains, absolute as well as relative, increasing 8399 per cent during the decade -Kansas, which ranked second in quantity of hides reported in 1909 and 1899, showed the largest absolute incrense of any state, while Texas showed the greatest relative gain Sheep pelts are a valuable product of the industry, but no :figures are available for 1899, and those given for 1904 are not entirely comparable with -ï Not reported those reported for 1909, because in 1904 a number of establishments engaged in slaughtering and me11t packing did wool pulling from purchased pelts1 nnd inadvertently included such purchased pelts with the number taken from owned sheep slaughtered in the plants -Each state shown in the table reported a large increase in the value of its sausage output, the largest :percentage of increase (3534 per cent) being in New Jersey, and the largest absolute gain in Illinois Illinois was the leading stato in the production of sau,sage, reporting 25 per cent of the total value in 1909 and 332 per cent in 1899 -Imports and exportsTablo 29 shows, for the years ,ending June 30, 1910, 1905, and 1900, the value of the exports and the imports of different classes of :meats and meat products, as distinguished by the  Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce -rhe total value of exports in 1900 and 1905 was greatly in excess of that of imports, but the difference was much less pronounced in 1910 Tho total valuo of exports decreased considerably during the period ,covered, whereas the valus of imports increased The -ïexports were mainly meats and meat products :intended ∑for human consumption, while the imports were principally hides and other animal products intended :as raw material for manufacture lhe value of hides and skins imported in 1910 formed 903 per cent of the total value of imports, whereas these articles formed but 13

\\x0cMANUFACTURES -The manufacture of butter, cheese, and condensed milk is treated in this report as a single industry, but tables are presented giving most of the important statistics for each of the three branches separately The general statistics shown for each branch represent the complete returns cif those establishments reporting the designated commodity as their product of chief value The value of products shown for the buttermaking branch of the industry, for example, may include the value of cheese or condensed milk manufactured incidentally in factories engaged primarily in the manufacture of butter Tables 22 to 25, however, show the total quantity of butter, cheese, and condensed milk manufactured by all establishments in the industry -Factories of considerable size are sometimes operated as adjuncts to farms, but such factories are considered a part of the farm equipment and are covered by the census of agriculturn rather than by that of manufactures The present report is therefore confined to establishments operated independently of farming activities In Table 4, however, the combined production of butter and cheese on farms and in the factories covered by the census of manufactures is shown This represents approximately the total output of butter and cheese for the United States -Skimming or separating stations operated in connection with a butter factory are counted as a part of that factory Independent separating stations, a small number of which are included among the establishments shown for 1899, have not been included at any later census Enterprises engaged primarily in the buying and selling of milk and cream, but manufactming small quantities of butter or cheese incidentally from surplus stock, were likewise excluded from the canvass for 1904 and 1909 -In many cases a number of factories or creameries situated in different localities but operated under the same management have been reported as a single establishment Where factories so operated were situated in different states, however, separate reports were secured for those in each state; and separate reports were likewise secured for any factories located in a city of 10,000 inhabitants or over (See Introduction) -Summary for the three branches of the industryTable 1 presents a summary of the statistics of the butter, cheese, and condensed milk industry for the United States as a whole for 1909 It distinguishes -three classes of factories, namely, those engaged primarily in the manufacture of butter, of cheese, and of condensed milk -The distribution of the establishments in the :industry in 1909, according to the kind of products macte, is shown in Table 2 -Of the total number of establishments in the industry in 1909, 7,965, or 939 per cent, were engaged exclusively in the manufacture of one of the three main products of the industry, and these reported -Comparison with earlier censuses for the industry as a wholeTable 3 summarizes the statistics of the butter, cheese, and condensed milk industry for each census from 1879 to 1909, inclusive -Com1mrative figures for the industry as a whole are not available for any date prior to 1879, nor does it ,appear that all three branches of the industry had :taken definite form much before that time The census :reports for 1849 gave statistics for 8 factories in Ohio -The value of products reported for the butter, cheese and condensed milk industry as a whole was nearl; eleven times as great in 1909 as in 1879 Some of this increase, however, may be accounted for by the increase in the price of all kinds of dairy products The relative increase in the cost of materials was greater than that in the value of products -Persons engaged in the industryï Iroprleters and firm members ï Salaried employees ïïï Wage earners (average number) ï -ï Comparable figures not avallnble, ï Percentage omitted bocause figures are not strictly comparable Comparative statistics for the three branches of the industry: 1909 and 1904The more important statistics for the three branches of the industry (butter making, cheese making, and the manufacture of condensed milk), as reported at the censuses of 1909 and 1904, are given in Table 4 Complete statistics for these branches are not available for any earlier -census The number of establishments manufacturing condensed milk as their only product or their product of chief value increased 679 per cent from 1904 to 1909 while the number of establishments engaged exclu~ -sively or primarily in the manufacture of butter decreased 86 per cent, and the number making cheese as their chief or only product decreased 14 per cent In value of products an increase is shown for each class of establishments, the percentages being 645 for the butter factories, 519 for the cheese factories, and 72 for the condensed milk factories -It is probable that the greater percentage of increase shown for condensetl milk factorieri as compared with butter and cheese factories is due largely to the fact that the condensecl milk branch of tho industry is of more recent development -Table 5 shows the total quantity of butter and cheese produced in the factories of the butter, cheese, and condensed milk industry and on farms in 1909 and -1 It is possible that the comp1lrison of farm production of butter ~or the two censuses is misleading !he figures published for 1899 mcluded certain estimated quantities to cover the production of farms with incomplete reports, but no such estimates were made for 1909, the figures representing only the quantities actually reported -971 per cent in 1909 Summary, by statesThe butter, cheese, and condensed milk industry as a whole is well distributed throughout the country, with establishments in 43 of the 48 states Table 6 presents the more important statistics for the industry by states, the states being arranged according to the value of products reported for 1909 -The diagram on the following page shows graphically the value of products reported for the leading states in 1909 and 1899, and the map the value of products reported for each state in 1909 -In determining the rank of the states, as shown in Table 6, all states are considered, regardless of whether or not they are shown separately in tho table; hence some omissions occur in the several series of numbers indicating rank, as certain states included under \"all other states\" held a higher rank in some items than some of tho states for which separate figures are given -In 1909 Wisconsin was the most important state in the combined industry as measured by value of products, having displaced New York, which had previously ranked :first In average number of wage earners and value added by manufacture, however, New York still held :first place in 1909 and Wisconsin ranked second, but the percentages of increase for the decade in these items, as well as in the value of products, were less for Ncw York than for Wisconsin Iowa ranked third as regards value of products in 1909 Minnesota, which shows an increase of 965 per -cent in value of products for the fiveyear period, a<lvanced from fifth place in HJ04 to fourth in rnoo, having exchanged positions with Illinois, which shows a gain of only 341 per cent for this period -The average number of female wage earners omployed in 1909 was 1,420, of whom 987, or 695 per cent, wore in the condensed milk factories Females formed 237 per cent o:f the total number of wage earners in this branch of the :industry, as compared with 32 per cont in the butter factories and 22 per cent in the cheese factories -Tho average number of wage earners employed in the indust1∑y, by states, is given in Table 26 for 1909, 1904, and 1899 The distribution by age and sex of the average number of wage earners employed dur:ing the year 1909 is not shown for the :individual states, but Table 27 gives, by states, such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, or the nearest representative day -In order to compare the distribution of persons engaged in the industry according to occupational status in 1909 with that shown at the census of 1904, it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 8 -Salaried employees show the greatest percentage of increase, and constitute the only class forming a larger proportion of the total in 1909 than :in 1904 -In 1909 the proportion of males 16 years of age and over in the average number of wage earners was somewhat greater than in 1904 or 1899, while the proportions of females 16 years of age and over and of children under 16 years of age were slightly lower than in tho two earlier years -Wage earners employed, by months,Table 10 gives the number of wage earners employed in the industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 for the 11 states in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed during the year -1 lhe month of maximum employment for each state is indicated l>y boldface figures and that of minimum employment l>y italic figures -The largest number of wage earners employed in the industry during any month of 1909 was 21,392, in July, and the smallest _number 15,121, in January, the minimum number bemg equal to 707 per cent of the maximum The period of greatest employment in the industry is naturally in the summer months, when milk and cream are most plentiful In 9 of the 11 leading states for which figures are given in Table 10 the maximum number of wage earners was reported either for June or for July In 1904 the maximum number, 18,768, were employed in July, and the minimum number, 12,089, in January, the minimum being equal to 644 per cent of the maximum The months of maximum and minimum employment for 1909, and the ,number of wage earners reported for these months, are given for 38 states in Table 27 -Prevailing hours of labor,In Table 11 the wage earners in the butter, cheese, and condensed milk factories in 1909 have been clas\"ified according to the hours of labor prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment is classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in the establishment, even though some employees worked a greater or less number of hours Separate figures are given :for each state in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed -Of the wage earners employed in the industry in 1909, more than threefourths (767 per cent) were employed in establishments where the prevailing hours of labor per week were 60 or more Only 51 per cent of the total number were employed in establishments where the prevailing hours were 72 or over, however; and 97 per cent were in establishments where the prevailing hours were 48 or less per week Of the seven grouptl into which the establishments in the industry are here classified, the one made up of establishments where the prevailing hours of labor per week were between 60 and 72 employed the largest -number of wage earners (6,825, or 37 per cent of the total number), though the group comprising establishments where the prevailing hours were 60 per week employed almost as many (6,379, or 346 per cent of the total) The group in which the prevailing hours per week were between 60 and 72 was the most important in point of number of wage earners employed in 8 of the 11 states for which figures are given in the table -Character of ownershipTable 12 presents data with respect to the character of ownership, or legal organization, of the establishments in the butter, cheese, and condensed milk industry for 1909 and 1904 -Of the total number of establishments reported for the industry, both in 1909 ancl in 1904, 155 per cent were under corporate ownership While corporations thus controlled a comparatively small percentage of the total number of establishments, the value of the l)roducts of these establishments represented 413 per cent of the total for the industry in 1909 and 365 per cent in 1904 It is probable that in the case of some of the establishments for which the cooperative form of ownership was reported the controlling association was actually incorporated, but it is impracticable to determine the number of corporations thus included among the cooperative associations Cooperative associations, as reported, controlled 327 per cent of the establishments engaged in the industry in 1909, as compared with 273 per cent in 1904, and reported -265 per cent of the total value of products in 1909 and 24 per cent in 1904 This form of ownership has increased in importance in those branches of tho industry devoted to the manufacture of butter and cheese, but no cooperative associations were reported for the condensed milk branch of the industry (See Table 14)Establishments controlled by :firms formed only 12 per cent of the total number in the industry in 1909, and reported only 98 per cent of the total value of products for that year The largest group of establishments numerically, both in 1909 and in 1904, was that of establishments under individual ownership, but these contributed in 1909 a smaller percentage of -the total value of products than those controlled either by corporations or by cooperative associations and in 1904 a smaller percentage than those controlled by corporations Between HJ04 and 1909 there was a decline in the relative importance of establishments under individual and firm ownership -Table 13 distributes the establishments in tho industry in 1900 according to character of ownership, and shows also for each group the avernge number of wage earners employed, the value of products, and the value added by manufacture, for each state which employed an average of more than 500 wage earners -Of the entire number of wage earners reported in 1909 for the industry as a whole, 3,418, or 185 per cent of the total, were employed in establishments under individual ownership; 1,791, or 97 per cent, in those under firm ownership; 9,299, or 505 per cent, in those under corporate ownership; and 3,923, or 213 per cent, in those under cooperative ownership (including one state establishment) In 7 of the 11 states for which figures are shown establishments under corporate ownership reported 11 larger value of products than those under any other form of ownership; in 2 states (Iowa and Minnesota) cooperative establishments reported the largest value of products; and in 2 states (Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) establishments under individual ownership reported the largest amount Establishments under corporate ownership reported the largest number of wage e11rners in 8 of the states, 1111d those under cooperative ownership in 3 -Minnesota shows the largest proportion of the total number of establishments and value of products for establishments under cooperative ownership (?08 per cent and 624 per cent, respectively), although Wisconsin shows a larger actual number of cooperative establisbments, with a greater value of products Wisconsu1 leJ in value of products for establishments under individual and cooperative ownership in 1909 and New York for those under firm and corpomte ownership -Table 14 presents statistics relating to character of ownership in 1909 for the three branches of the butter, cheese, and condensed milk industry -Of tho establishments in which butter was the product of chief value, those controlled by cooperative associations constituted the most numerous group, but those under corporate ownership reported the largest -proportion of the wage earners and of the total value of products Among the cheese factories, establishments under individual ownership, and among the condensed milk factories, those under corpor11te ownership formed the most important class in respect to all the items shown in the table -Establishments classified according to sizeTable 15 groups the establishments of the butter, cheese, 11nd condensed milk industry, and of each of its three branches, according to the value of products per establishment in 1909, and shows for each group, for 1909 and 1904, the number of establishments and the value of products, together with the percentage of the respective totals represented by each group -ï Includes tho group \"less than $5,000,\" to avoid disclosure of lndivld\\\\llll operations 1 Less than onetenth of 1 per cent -Of the 8,479 establishments reported for 1909, only 9 had products valued at $1,000,000 or over In 1904 3 such establishments were reported, but their statistics could not be shown separately without disclosing individual operations The value of products of the 9 establishments of this class in 1909formed 4 3per cent of the total for the industry, while the value of products of the 833 establishments reporting less than $5,000 formed but 1 per cent of the total The establishments having products valued at less than $20,000 constituted more than onehalf (60l per cent) of the total number reported, but the value of their products amounted to only 19 per cent of the total The corresponding proportions for such establishments at the census of 1904 were 766 per cent and 347 per cent, respectively Thus the greater part of the value of products of the industry was reported by establishments having products valued at $20,000 or over, these establishments contributing 81 per cent of the total in 1909 and 653 per cent in 1904 -In the buttermaking branch of the industry, establishments with products valued at less than $20,000 reported only 113 per cent of the total value of products in 1909, while those with products valued at -In some respects, and especially from the standpoint of conditions under which persons engaged in the industry work, the best classification of establishments to bring out the feature of size is a classification according to the number of wage earners employed Table 16 gives such a classification for the industry as a whole, showing not only the number of establishments falling into each group, but also the average number of wage earners employed in each class of establishments for the 11 states in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed in 1909 -Of the total number of wage earners, 502 per cent were reported by establishments employing from 1 to 5 wage earners, 183 per cent by those employing from 6 to 20, 263 per cent by those employing from 21 to 100, and 51 per cent by those employing more than -100 The table shows that from the standpoint of employment the majority of the establishments in the industry as a whole in each of the states shown are small Only four states had any establishments employing more than 100 wage earners, and of the wage earners employed in such establishments 59 per cent were in Illinois In two states, Minnesota and Wisconsin, more than fourfilths of the wage earners (859 per cent and 824 per cent, respectively), were in establishments employing from 1 to 5 wage earners \\x0cMANUFACTURES -ExpensesAs stated in the Introduction, the census :figures for expenses do not purport to represent the total cost of manufacture, since they take no account of interest or depreciation, and consequently they can not properly be used for calculating profits Facts of interest, however, may be brought out concerning the relative importance of the different classes of expenses which make up the total As shown in Table 1, the expenses reported for 1909 amounted to $258,698,374, distributed as follows: $235,546,064, or -911 per cent, for cost of materials; $11,081,308, or 43 per cent, for wages; $3,590,624, or 14 per cent, for salaries; and $8,480,378, or 33 per cent, for miscellaneous expenses, consisting of amounts paid for advertising, traveling expenses, ordinary repairs of buildings and machinery, taxes, insurance, and other sundry expenses not elsewhere included The cost of milk and cream used for materials forms such a large proportion of the total expenses in the industry that there is relatively little variation in the proportions shown for the four items of expense in the different states Table 17 shows, in percentages, for the industry as a whole and for the three branches, the distribution of the reported expenses among the classes indicated -There was very little difference in the proportions represented by the several classes of expenses between the butter factories and the cheese factories, although the percentage for cost of materials was slightly greater in the latter In the manufacture of condensed milk, however, the proportion for cost of -Engines and powerThe amount of power used in the butter, cheese, and condensed milk industry was first reported at the census of 1889 Table 2 shows that the total horsepower used in the industry as a whole increased from 25,526 in 1889 to 101,349 in 1909 Table 18 shows for the industry the number of engines or other motors, according to their character, employed in generating power (including electric motors operated by purchased current), and their total horsepower, at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899 It also shows separately the number and horsepower of electric motors, including those operated by current generated in the establishments reporting -In 1909, fLS in 1904 and 1399, steam power formed the major part of the primary power used in the industry, but its relative importance has decreased considerably since 1899 In that year steam power formed -961 per cent of the total primary power, but in 1909 the percentage was only 896 Rented electric power, on tha other hand, represented 53 per cent of the total in 1909, as compared with threetenths of 1 per cent in 1899, and the power of gfLS and other internal combustion engines also shows a marked increfLSe in relative importance Although the industry is not onethat requires a large amount of power, the average per establishment increased from 95 horsepower in 1899 to 105 horsepower in 1904 and 12 horsepower in 1909 -Table 19 shows the amount of each of the several kinds of power and of the different kinds of fuel used in the industry in 1909, for 11 leading states -reported for Ohio, the largest amount of oil for California, and the greatest quantity of wood for Wisconsin -The special schedule used in collecting the statistics for the butter, cheese, and condensed milk industry included inquiries as to the quantity and cost of the milk and cream used during the year and the quantity and value of the various products In the case of cooperative factories, or those where the materials were not purchased but were handled on fixed terms, -Quantity and value of principal materials used, by states: 1909In Table 20 the quantity and cost of of the principal materials used in the manufacture of butter, cheese, and condensed milk in 1909 are shown, by states -The :figures given in the table for cream and skimmed milk represent the quantities of these materials delivered as such at the factories rather than the quantities actually used in the manufacture of butter, cheese, and other products Large additional quantities of cream are separated from whole milk at the butter factories, and while much of the skimmed milk resulting from this separation is sold or returned to patrons, the quantities used in the manufacture of cheese and casein doubtless far exceed the small quantities reported as purchased Moreover, in some instances considerable quantities of whole milk and cream are sold by the factories instead of being used for manufacturing purposes It is evident, therefore, -that the figures in the table do not represent the actual quantities of the specified materials used in the manufacture of the different products -for Vermont show 1 pound of cream to 5 pounds of milk, and for Connecticut, one of the states where the industry is practically confined to the manufacture of butter, the quantity of cream reported was more than three times as great as the quantity of milk The relative quantity of milk used in a given state depends in a measure upon the extent to which cheese and condensed milk are manufactured in the state, and the states showing the smallest ratios between the quantity of milk and the quantity of cream reported as materials are those in which butter is the principal product of the industry It is evident, ∑ however, that there are other important factors to be considered Chief among these, perhaps, is the extent to which it has become customary, in the sections where the butter factories are located, for the farmers to separate the milk on the farm and send the cream to the factory instead of the whole milk, as was the practice before the hand separator came into general use -In quantity of milk reported New York and Wisconsin were the foremost states in 1909, with 245 per cent and 239 per cent, respectively, of the tot1tl, while Wisconsin, Iowa, and Minnesota, ranking in the order named, together reported more than half of the cream purchased -Sugar is used for the m?st pa,rt in the manufact:n∑e of sweetened condensed m11k, and the extent to wh10h it is used is therefore directly dependent upon the production of this variety of condensed milk -United States Wisconsin  NowYork  Iowa Minnesota  Illlnoisïïïïïï Michigan  Pennsylvaniaï Californiaïïï Ohio Vermont  Nebraska  Waslllngt;on  -In all the states for which separate figures are given in the table, large increases took place during each fiveyear period in the amount of cream reported by the factories, except in Vermont, where the quantity decreased somewhat between 1904 and 1909 On the other hand, there were only four states, Wisconsin, New York, Michigan, and Washington, in which the -quantity of milk roported for 1909 was greater than tha,t for 1899, and only two, Nebraska and Washington, in which it was greater than that for 1904 The most pronounced decrease during the decade in the quantity of milk wtis in Iowa, in which state there was a decrease of 1,111,222,632 pounds, or about fiveeighths o:f the net decrease dming the decade in the industry as a whole -The rapid increase in the quantity of cream reported (together with the decrease in the quantity of milk which generally accompanies it) is doubtless due in large measure to the introduction of the hancl separator, which enables tlie farmer to separate the milk economically on the farm lhe importance of the increase in the relative quantity of cream purchased, and of the hand separator as a factor in bringing about this change, is the more evident in view of the fact that the whole increase must be accounted for by the buttermaking branch of the industry, since cream is not used to any extent in the manufacture of either cheese or condensed milk -Attention is again called to the fact that in the tables showing separately the quantities of butter, cheese, and condensed milk manufactured the :figures represent the total quantity of the given product reported for the industry as a whole, whether made in establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of that product or in establishments belonging to one of the other branches of the industry The products made in establishments in other industries are not included in the totals, but the quantities, so fro, as available, are shown in a footnote -United

combined output of these three states representing 584 per cent of the total for the industry The quantity of condensed milk produced in the :five states next in rank, namely, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Oregon, represented 30 per cent of the total, making 884 per cent for the eight states taken together Four states, Arkansas, Connecticut, Maryland, and Texas, reported the production of condensed milk for the first time in 190!), but the quantity can not be shown separately without disclosing individual operations There were three states which had reported this product at one or more of the earlier censuses that reported none for 1909 -In the production of butter the three most important divisions at each census were the \"West North Central, the East North Central, and the Midclle Atlantic, ranking in the order named In 1909 the West North Central division produced 39 per cent of the total quantity of butter reported for the industry, the East North Centml division 309 per cent, and the Jvliddle Atlantic 123 per cent, these three leading divisions together reporting over fourfilths of the total The quantity of butter made in factories in the West North Centrnl and East North Central divisions shows an increase for each :fiveyear period, and the proportions which their output formed of the total for the industry were greater in 1909 than in either 1904 or 1899 The production in the Middle Atlantic division increased between 1899 and 1904, but decreased between 1904 and 1909 to a figure below that of 1899, and formed a smaller percentage of the total at each successive census Of the remaining divisions only two, the New England and the South Atlantic, reported a smaller output in 1909 than in 1899 In the Pacific, Mountain, and West South Central divisions the increases during eacl1 fiveyear period were considerable and the proportions which these divisions contributed to the total production were larger in 1909 than in 1904 or 1899

East North Central and Middle Atlantic divisions together produced bj far the greater part of the total output of condensed milk, but notwithstanding large increases in actual production in both divisions the percentage which the product of the Middle Atlantic division represented of the total was lower in 1909 than at the earlier censuses This is due chiefly to the remarkable increase during the decade in the Pacifie, division, whicl1 produced 152 per cent of the total quantity of condensed milk in 1909, as compared with 34 per cent in 1809 -Quantity and value of products, by states:

of the industry in 1909, 923 per cent was fullcream cheese, 35 per cent was partcream cheese, 25 per cent was skimmedmilk cheese, and 17 per cent was reported under the heading of \"other kinds,\" comprising a number of fancy varieties, such as N eufchatel and Brie -lhe several kinds of cheese were not uniformly reported at the three censuses The supplemental schedule used for the industry in 1904 called for separate returns for three classes of cheese, designated, respectively, standardfactory( cheddars or flats), skimmed cheese, and \"other kinds,\" while that used in 1899 distinguished only two kinds, standard factory and \"other kinds\" Further, the quantities of fullcream and partcream cheese reported for 1909 include a number of kinds of cheese that in 1904 and 1899 were classified as \" other kinds\" -The two kinds of condensed milk, sweetened and unsweetened, were not reported separately prior to 1904 During the fiveyear period 19041909, however, the increase in the production of unsweetened condensed milk was much more rapid than that in the production of the sweetened varietythe respective percentages being 1545 and 81 lhe proportion which unsweetened condensed milk represented of the total production thus increased from 357 per cent in 1904 to 566 per cent in 1909 -The quantity of skimmed milk sold shows a rapid decrease from census to census This decrease is due in part to the growing practice of delivering cream instead of milk to butter factories, and in part to the growth of the condensed milk industry, in which the whole milk is used with no residue of skimmed milk -The number of cream separators used by the factories decreased from 9,701 in 1899 to 8,842 in 1904 and 5,624 in 1909 This decrease is no doubt due in great part to the increasing use of separators on the farms, which has already been spoken of in connection with the large increase in the amount of cream received at the factories and the relative decrease :in the amount of whole milk received -The principal statistics secured by the census inquiry concerning the butter, cheese, and condensed milk industry are presented, by states, in Tables 26 -of establishments, number of persons engaged in the industry, primary horsepower, capital invested, salaries, wages, cost of materials, value of products, and value added by manufacture, and Table 27 gives statistics ingreater detail for 1909 only -summary for the four branches of the industry: 1909Table 1 presents a summary of the statistics of the canning and preserving industry as a whole for 1909 It also distinguishes four classes of establishments: (1) Establishments whose chief products are canned and preserved fruits and vegetables1including dried and packed fruits put up by packing houses; (2) establishments whose chief products are canned and cured fish, including pickled, smoked1and dried fish; -(3) establishments whose chief products are canned oysters and clams; (4) establishments whose chief products are pickles, preserves1jellies, sauces, etc The general statistics for the industry do not cover the canning of meats, soups, or other products by meatpacking establishments1statistics for which are included with those for the sln,ughtering and meatpacking industry Data as to the quantity of canned and preserved fruits1vegetables, and fish produced as subsidiary or incidental products in the meatpacking or other industries are, however, shown in the footnotes to Table 17 The drying and packing of fruits and vegetables when done on the farm by the gTower is not included, the value of the products so prepared on farms being covered by the census of agriculture The shucking of oysters, except as done in connection with canning, is not considered as properly within the scope of the census of manufactures -In making up the statistics for the four branches of the industry named, each establishment has been assigned according to its product of chief value Some of the establishments are engaged in the canning of fruits and vegetables in the summer and fall months and in the canning and preserving of fish and oysters at other times; and large quantities of pickles, preserves, and sauces are made by establishments engaged primarily in canning vegetables This overlapping makes it advisable to present in most of the tables only totals for all establishments in the four branches of the industry combined -In the canning and preserving industry the cost of materials constitutes a large proportion of the total value of products, the processes of manufacture being relatively simple and inexpensive The combined cost of the materials used by all four branches of the industry in 1909 was $101,823,059, which is equal to 648 per cent of the total value of p1∑oducts -Of the 37767 establishments canvassed in 1909, nearly threefourths (2 1789) were engaged primarily in the canning and preserving of fruits and vegetables, these establishments contributing products to the value of $91,439,161 7 or 582 per cent of the total for the industry as a whole Establishments engaged chiefly in the canning and curing of fah formed approximately oneeleventh of the total number, and the value of their products represented 162 per cent of the total for all four branches The 70 establishments engaged chiefly in oyster canning contributed -18 per cent of the total value of all products; and those establishments whose chief products were pickles, preserves, and sauces, wMch formed about oneseventh of the total number, contributed 238 per cent of the total value In the case of establishments engaged primarily in canning fruits and vegetables the cost of materials represented 684 per cent of the value of products; in the case of those handling fish principally1624 per cent; oI those chiefly canning oysters and clams7 558 per cent; and of those makingchiefly pickles, preserves, and sauces, 584 per cent It should be ,ted that the cost of cans and other containers is an1mportant factor in the cost of materials -1 A minus sign () denotes decrease Where percentagea ure omitted, comparable figures are not available ï Comparahlo figures not available s :Figures not comparable -Comparable statistics for the industry as a whole are not available for censuses prior to 1889 The canning and preserving of food products is an industry which lies on the border line between manufacture on the one hand, and agriculture and fishing on the other, and for this reason the several branches of the industry have not always been regarded in census reports as manufacturing business In 1879 there were reported 520 establishments engaged in the canning and preserving of fruits and vegetables and the manufacture of J)icklos, preserves, and sauces, which gave employment to an average of 32,835 wage earners, and turned out products valued at $20,006,918; but statistics for the canning and preserving of fish and oysters in 1879 are not available -The value of products reported was more than three times as great in 1909 as in 1889, but part of the increase is attributable to the advance that has taken place in the price of tho farm and sea products used as materials The average number of wage earners reported shows little change from census to census, but; the figures shown in the table for 1889 are far from comparable with those for later censuses1 The introduction of new and improved machinery has permitted an increase in output since 1899 without an increase -1 The main source of incomparability between the statistics of wage eamers for 1889 and those for later years is found in the fact that the average uumb2r for 1889 was computed on the basis of the number of weeks or months each plant was in operation, while the average number for later censuses was computed on the basis of a full years operation, even though the plant may have run only a short time A plant running si:x: months and employing continuously during that period 50 wage earners would have been reported in 1889 as having an average of 50, while at later censuses it would have been reported as having an average of 25 In the case of industries in which most establishments operate continuously, this change in the method of calculating the average number of wage earners has little effect upon the comparability of the statistics; hut in ihc case of a seasonal industry like canning and preserving it has a very great effect The figures for the average number of wage earners in 1889 in this induMry are much larger thaii they would be if computed on the basis used at laLer censuses -Comparison with earlier censuses for the four branches of the industryTable 3 shows, for the four branches of tho industry separately, the most important items for 1909 and 1899 and the per cent of increase -The canning and preserving of fruits and vegetables, the largest of the four branches of the industry, showed a marked increase during the decade 18991909 in all items except the average number of wage earners, for which the increase was only 89 per cent The, value of products increased 62 per cent In fish canning and preserving there was a decrease of 355 per cent in the average number of wage earners, but this decrease was probably due in part to the erroneous inclusion in 1899 either of some of the fishermen engaged in the catching of fish or of some of the laborers engaged on contract workthat is, working for contractors and not employed directly by the manufacturerfor whichworkonly the expenses should be reported This branch of the industry shows the least relative increase of any of the four branches in value of products, but this may be accounted for in part by the great growth in

branch, although the least important, shows by far the greatest percentages of increase during tho decade In 1909 there were approximately three times as many establishments as in 1899, twice as many wage earners, twice as great a value of products, and three times as great a value added by manufacture The manufacture of pickles, preserves, and sauces shows an increase during the decade of -322

the Introduction -In view of the seasonal nature of the indu<Jtry, this method of calculation may give somewhat less accurate results in this case than for some of the other industries -Scope of the industryThis industry includes all establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of ice for sale, together with a few coldstorage houses making ice for sale in considerable quantities For some establishments of the latter class the two branches of business were so closely interwoven that the receipts for storage had to be included in the value of products For manufacturing plants in other indus-tries making ice for sale, only the quantity and value of the ice was reported For establishments such as breweries, coldstorage houses, and chemical factories, which manufacture ice solely for their own use, no statistics of any kind are included in this report -Comparison with earlier censusesTable 1 summarizes the statistics of the industry for each census from 1869 to 1909, inclusive

The moath of maximum employment for each state is indicated by boldface figures and that of minimum employmrnt by italic figures -The largest number of wage earners employed in the industry during any month of 1909 was 22,872, in July, and the smallest number, 9,847, in January, the minimum number being equal to 431 per cent of the maximum In 1904, likewise, the maximum number was employed in July,

group and that composed of establishments reporting products valued at more than $100,000 showed a gain in relative importance in 1909 -as compared with 1904, whereas the relative importance of

Table 18, was $315 In most of the leading states the average value per ton was somewhat less than the average for the country as a whole; thus in Missouri the value per ton was $233; in New York, $255; in Ohio, $256; in Pennsylvania, $276; :in Illinois, $285; and in California, $304 In Texas, however, the average value was $470 In ;most of the Southern states, in fact, and in those Western states (except California) which reported establishments ∑in the industry, the value per ton was greater than the average for the country as a whole, reaching $526 in Oregon and $608 in Idaho  -For the ice made as a secondary product in other industries the average value per ton was $268, this average being lower in most of the states than that for ice made as a primary product -Methods of

data secured concerning the establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of ice for sale are presented, by states, in Tables 20 and 21 -the industry, primary horsepower, capital invested, salaries, wages, cost of materials, value of products, and value added by manufacture -Scope of the industryThe establishments assigned to this industry are engaged in cleaning the rough rice of dirt and other foreign substances, removing the outer shell or hull, and the inner cuticle or bran, and, in roost instances, polishing the grain by friction so as to give it a pearly luster There are two methods of conducting the businessmerchant milling, in which the rough rice is purchased, milled, and the products sold; and custom milling, in which the rough rice belonging to others is treated on a contract basis for a stipulated price or for a portion of the rice itself Table 1 distinguishes the quantities of rough rice and its several products according to the basis upon which the rice was treated -Of the 71 establishments reported for 1909, 41 were engaged exclusively in merchant milling, 8 exclusively in custom milling, and 22 in both merchant and custom milling Where mills employed both methods, merchant milling, as a rule, constituted the greater proportion of the business, only 183 per cent of the rice milled by such establishments being treated on a custom basis In recent years there has been a decided change in the relative importance of the two methods of conducting business In 1904 there were 12 mills en~agecl exclusively in merchant milling, 31 exclusively in custom milling, and 31 in both merchant ttnll custom milling, the larger part -of the operations of mills of the last class being custom milling Of the total quantity of rough rice treated in 1909, 902 per cent was handled on a merchant basis and 98 per cent on a custom basis The quantities of whole rice obtained by merchant milling and by custom milling were equal to 495 per cent and -441 per cent of the gross weight of the rough rice treated on these respective bases The corresponding percentages for broken rice were 152 and 154, respectively Table 1 -Summary and comparison with earlier

for more than 200 years, and prior to the Civil War had reached considerable proportions The largest gain, however, has occurred during the last decade, during which period the production quadrupled The first census statistics of rice cleaning and polishing were secured in 1880; they covered the year 1879 and -∑ The statistics of persons engaged in the industry at the censuses of 1879 and 1889 are not strictly comparttble with those for the later years It is apparent, however, that the improvements in machinery and in methods of treatment have resulted in a disproportionate growth in value of products as compared with -number of wage earners, since the use of more elaborate machinery tends to increase the size or capacity of establishments without proportionately increasing the number of employees The number of wage eamers in the industry increased greatly between 1899 and 1904, but decreased somewhat in the period 19041909 -General statistics, by statesThe principal data secured by the census inquiry concerning the rice cleaning and polishing industry are l)resented by states in Table 3, which shows, for 1909, 1904, and 1899, the number of establishments, number of persons engaged in the industry, primary horsepower, capital invested, principal items of expense, value of products, and value added by manufacture -There was thus between 1899 and 1909 considerable change in the relative importance of the different states in the industry The number of establishments in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina decreased greatly, while Alabama, California, Florida, :Mississippi, and New York, each of which reported one or more establishments in 1899, returned none in 1909 The number of establishments in Texas increased from 1 in 1899 to 19 in 1909, and Arkansas, which had none in 1899, had 5 establishments in 1909 -This shift in the industry was due to the very general abandonment of rice growing on the lowlands near -with irrigation on the level prairie lands of Louisiona, Texas and Arkansas, where machinery can be used in pla~ting and harvesting According to the census of agriculture, the acreage in rice in these three states in 1899 was 210,421, or 615 per cent of the total for the country, and the production of rough rice in them was 6 472 227 bushels, or 719 per cent of the total In -per cent and the production 2262 per cent, while in all other states combined the acreage decreased 79 per  cent and the production 714 per cent -With the shift in the industry has come the abandonment of many small custom mills and the erection of large mills equipped with the latest improved machinery for cleaning and polishing the grain The horsepower for running the mills was 7,546 in 1899, or an average of 94 per establishment; it had increased to 19,519 in 1909, an average of 275 per establishment -Persons engaged in the industryTable 5 shows, by classes, for 1909, the number of persons engaged in the rice cleaning and polishing industry, classified according to occupational status and sex, and, in the case of wage earners, according to age It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -The largest number of wage earners employed in the rice cleaning and polishing industry during any month in 1909 was 2,017,in October, and the smallest number, 436, in July, the minimum number forming ~16 per cent of the maximum The height of the rice cleaning and polishing season extends from September to December, inclusive, during which period the number of wage earners fluctuated from 1,750 to 2,017 -Character of ownershipOf the establishments engaged in the rice cleaning and polishing industry in 1909, 57 were operated by corporations, 5 by firms, and 9 by individuals Of the wage earners, 1,063, or 858 percent, were employed by corporations; 73, or59 per cent, by firms; and 103, or 83 per cent, by individuals The proportions of the value of products reported by establishments under each form of ownership were as follows: Corporations, 89 per cent; firms, 46 per cent; and individuals, 64 per cent -ï I$563,538, or 26 per cent; sa1aries, $613,085, or 28 per cent; and miscellaneous expenses, made up of advertising, ordinary repairs of buildings and machinery, insurance, traveling expenses, and other sundry expenses, $870,842, or 4 per cent The processes in this industry are so simple that the items of expense other than cost of materials are comparatively small There are only slight variations among the different states in the distribution of expenses -FuelClosely related to the question of the kind of power employed is that of the fuel consumed in generating the power  The total cost of fuel and of rented power for the industry in 1909, as shown by Table 4, was $124,736 The fuel consumed consisted of 10,049 tons of coal, 3,148 cords of wood, and 56,873 banels of oil, the entire quantity of the last named being returned for Louisiana and Texas, where it is generally used in generating steam power The hulls obtained -in cleaning rough rice are extensively used as fuel, but no data were collected as to the quantity so used -Materials and products,The special schedule used in collecting the statistics for the rice cleaning and polishing industry required a statement of the quantity of rough rice treated, whether domestic or foreign, and of the quantities and values of the different products manufactured Table 7 shows these statistics, by states, for 1909 and 1904 and so far as available for 1899 -Notwithstanding the decrease in quantity of rough rice treated, there was an increase of 2,189,244 pounds -m the aggregate quantity of clean rice obtained in 1909, as compared with 1904 In 1899 the weight of clean rice obtained was 61 per cent of the weight of the rough rice treated; in 1904, 624 per cent; and in 1909, 642 per cent The gain in the proportion of clean rice obtained, while clue to some extent to improvements in mill equipment and better methods of treatment, was also caused in part by changes in the proportions of the different varieties of rough rice treated In recent years much attention has been given to the selection of seed, with special reference to the yield and to the milling qualities, and this naturally has increased the proportion of clean rice obtained, as well as the proportion of whole rice as distinguished from broken rice and polish -The proportion of clean rice obtained varies considerably in different states In Arkansas the 1noportiou -659 per cent of the total (623,900,245 pounds), in 1904 Thus in 1904, 341 per cent of the clean rice was broken, as compared with only 237 per cent in 1909, an undoubted evidence of the greater efficiency of the mills and of improvement in the varieties of the grain With the increase in the proportion of clean rice obtained has come a decrease in quantity of polish and bran fo view of the fact that hulls are generally used for fuel and that only a small proportion is sold, accurate data as to the total production ~re not available Hulls are used to some extent in the manufacture of feed and for packing ice, crockery ware, and other articles of commerce The exportation of hulls amounts to about $100,000 per year, Germany taking more than onehalf of the total ∑The value of products increased $13,647,731, or -Equipment and capacityTable 8 shows, by states the number of hufftng and polishing machines in ric~ mills in 1909 and the estimated maximum capacity of rough rice per day of 24 hours -Table 8 Estimated maximum STATE Hullingmachines (number) Polishlngmachines (number) capacity of rough rice per day or 24 hours (bushels of

diversified as the hulling machines, some of them being skin pads operated in such a manner that the rice grains are treated by rubbing them against each other and against the pads -In 1909 for all mills combined the estimated maxi~ mum capacity of rough rice per clay of 24 hours was 341,409 bushels of 45 pounds each This compares with 301,545 bushels in 1904, an increase of 39,864 bushels, or 132 per cent Had all the mills been operated continuously to their maximum capacity it would have required approximately 63 days to treat the total quantity of rough rice actually reported for the year -None of the statistics heretofore presented include data for the rice cleaning and polishing industry in Hawaii, where it is largely in the hands of the Chinese and Japanese Some of the mills treat only the rice grown on the plantation where the mill is situated, some treat only foreign rice, while a number handle Hawaiian rice largely on a custom basis rhe first census in Hawaii, following the a1mexation to the United States, covered the year 1899 and the next related to 1909, no data having been collected there for 1904 -Table 9 summarizes the statistics for the rice cleaning and polishing industry in Hawaii for 1899 and 1909 -The number of persons engaged in the industry increased from 267 to 518 This increase, however, was almost entirely the result of an increase in the number of proprietors and firm members, which increased from 76 to 346 In recent years the partnership form of ownership in its several variations has been in great favor, sometimes as many as 30 or 40 persons being interested in a single establishment The decrease in the number of wage eamers is probably clue to the increase in the number of proprietors who actually performed services The largest number of wage earners, 153, was employed in December, and the smallest number, 121, was employed in Juno The most active period in the industry was from July to December, though marked activity is shown in March, due to the fact that in each year two crops of rice are producedone in the sp1fag and one in the fall -Scope of the industryThe salt industry, as defined by the Census Bureau, covers both establishments engaged in making salt by the evaporation of brine obtained either from subterranean sources by means of wells, from the sea, or from saline springs and lakes, and those which manufacture merchantable salt from natural deposits of rock salt This latter portion of the business is partly a mining industry, but for the purposes of the census reports it seemed better to combine all branches of the salt industry, without distinguishing between mining and manufacturing The statistics shown in this report, therefore, cover the work of extracting the crude material from its original source, as well as its subsequent manufacture into the finished product -Several establishments engaged in the manufacture of soda products use as material salt brine obtained on their own premises, but the returns of such concerns, except as explained in the discussion of Table 10, are included in census statistics with those for the -industry covered by the designation chemicals\" Those establishments whose principal product is salt, but which sell brine to establishments engaged in the manufacture of soda, or make bromine or other chemicals as byproducts, are classed with ∑the salt industry and the statistics for such establishments are included in aH the tables in this report In 1849, 340 establishments were reported as engaged in the manufacture of salt, these establishments giving employment to an average of 2,786 hands and turning out products valued at $2,177,945 In 1859, 399 establishments were reported, employing an average of 2,213 hands and turning out products to the value of $2,289,504 -Comparison with earlier censusesTable 1 summarizes the statistics of tho salt industry for 011ch census from 1869 to 1909, inclusive

that there has been a constant decrease from census to census in the number of establishments engaged in the industry, and, on the other hand, an increase in the value of products, indicating that there has been a marked increase in the average productive capacity of the plants -In 1909 the value of products was $11,327,834, of which amount 459 per cent represented the cost of materials ∑ Although, as noted in the Introduction, the statistics of capital are not entirely satisfactory, they are of sufficient accuracy to show that the value of products was remarkably small in proportion to the -total capital employed h1 the industry The number of wage earners in 1909 was 4,936, an increase for the decade of only 33 per cent; the absolute increase was two less than for the salaried employees The amount paid in wages showed a much greater relative increase -(325 per cent) than was shown for the number of wage earners (33 per cent) Summary, by statesTable 2 summarizes the more

manufacture of salt is a localized industry, being confined to places where the salt brine or deposits of salt are found It was reported from only 13 states in 1909 Michigan was the leading state in the industry, as measured by value of products and value added by manufacture, but in number of wage earners it was second to New York In 1904 these conditions were reversed, New York ranking first in value of products and value added by manufacture, and ranking second to Michigan in number of wage earners The number of wage earners employed in the industry in Michigan decreased 59 per cent during the decade ending with 1909, while the value of products increased 485 per cent, representing in 1909 almogt; onethird of the total for the industry The combined value of the products of the three leading states, :Michigan, New York, and Ohio, constituted almost threefourths of the total for the industry Of the states shown separately, Ohio and California reported the greatest rel-1209 per cent and 963 per cent, respectively Persons engaged in the industryTable 3 shows for 1909 the number of persons engaged in the industry, classified according to occupational status and sex, and in the case of wage earners according to age also It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and in other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -885 per cent, were wage earners, 291, or 52 per cent, were proprietors and officials, and 353, or 63 per cent, were clerks, this class including other subordinate salaried employees Of the total number of persons in the industry, 92 per cent were males and 8 per cent females Only 7 children were employed as wage earners Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 4 gives the number of wage earners employed in the salt industry on the 15th (or nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 5 the wage earners in the salt industry have been classified according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even -Character of ownership,Table 6 presents statistics with respect to the character of ownership of the establishments in the salt industry -The number of establishments under each form of ownership decreased from 1904 to 1909, the relative decrease being greatest for those owned by individuals In 1909 corporations controlled over twothirds of the total establishments, and the value of the products of these establishments represented more than ninetenths of the total for the industry -Size of establishmentsTable 7 presents statistics for establishments in the salt industry in 1909 and 1904 grouped according to the val~e of products -The total primary power used in the salt manufacturing establishments increased 142 per cent from 1899 to 1909 In 1909, as in 1904 and 1899, power generated by steam engines constituted more than ninetenths of the total primary power, although the proportion of such power had decreased from 968 -per cent in 1899 to 914 per cent in 1909 The increased use of rented electric power caused its relative importance to increase from onetenth of 1 per cent of the total primary horsepower in 1899 to 45 per cent in 1909 The number and horsepower of electric motors run by means of current generated in the establishments in the industry also show a decided increase -Fuel consumedExcept where salt is produced by solar evaporation of brine in open vats or tanks, fuel is a very important factor in the process of salt manufacture, and Table 9 shows the quantity of each kind of -fuel consumed in the industry in 1909 In 1909 the amount expended for fuel and rent of power, as shown -In addition, 25,043 barrels of salt, valued at $8,415, were produced by estnbï lishments engaged primarily in tho manufacture of products other than those covered by the indusay designation-ï Includes potassium bromide, reduced to tbs equivalent or bromine In order to avoid a duplicate canvass, the United States Geological Survey, which annually collects statistics of the production of salt, and the Bureau of the Census cooperated in collecting ciata for the year 1909 Excluding the production of salt for Hawaii and Porto Rico, the reports of the two bureaus agree for 1909 The variation in the reports for other census years may be attributed to differences in the methods employed by the two bureaus These differences, especially in the quantities of the different grades of salt, are sufficient to affect to a certain extent the comparability of the totals for 1909 with those for 1904 and 1899 -The value of salt, as shown in the table, does not include the value of the containers, which is included under \"all other products\" for each census The barrel of 280 pounds is used for showing quantities of salt -The grades of salt, the quantity of each of which is shown in Table 10, are described by the United States Geological Survey, in its report for 1909 on salt production,1 as follows: -For convenience salt is classified according to the grades by which itissold by the producer, the grades being determined by the amount of refining, the methods employed in refining, and the purposes for which the salt is used These grades are \"table and dairy, \"common fine,\" \"common coarse,\" \"packers,\"∑ \"solar, \"rock,\" \"milling,\" \"brine,\" and \"other grades\" The \"table and dairy\" salt includes extra fine and fancy grades prepared for family use, and all grades artificially dried, used for butterand cheese making, itnd such special brands Under \"common :fine\" salt are included all other grades of fine salt of :first quality, not artificially dried, such as those known to the trade as \"C F,\" \"No 1 F,\" \"anthracite,\" etc \"Common coarse\" salt includes all grades coarser than \"co=on fine,\" made by artificial heat, such as \"steam coarse,\" \"No 1 coarse,\" \"pan solar,\" \"G A,\" \"Liverpool ground,\" \"C C,\" etc By \"packers\" salt is meant those grades prepared for the purpose of curing :fish, meats, etc \"Coarse solar\" includes all coarse salt made by solar evaporation \"Rock\" salt includes all salt mined and shipped without special preparation \"Mill\" salt is that used in gold and silver mills, and \"other grades\" includes all lowgrade or No 2 salt, used in salting cattle and for fertilizers, track purposes, etc \"Brine\" includes all salt liquor used in the manufacture of soda ash, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydrate (caustic soda), and other sodium salts or brine sold without being evaporated to dryness -The statistics shown in Table 10 concerning the processes employed refer to the methods of evaporating the brine to the required dryness for salt manufacture They do not apply to establishments producing rock salt, of which there are several in the United States The solar process of salt manufacture, according to the returns, was used exclusively in -Nevada and New Mexico, largely in California and Utah, and in part in New York and Texas In all other states in which salt was made from brine, arti-ficial heat was the only means used for the evaporation of the brine The grainer process of evaporation was more frequently reported than any other -The principal statistics secured by the census inquiry concerning salt manufacture are presented by states in Table 11, showing for 1909 the number of establishments reporting, the number of persons engaged in -the industry, primary horsepower employed, capital invested, salaries, wages, cost oi materials, miscellaneous expenses, value of products, and value added by manufacture -Summary for the three industries combined: 1909Table 1 presents a summary of the more important statistics for the sugar industries as a group for 1909 The establishments in the group constitute three industries, designated in the census statistics of manufactures as \"beet sugar,\" \"sugar and molasses,\" and \"sugar refining, not including beet sugar\" The sugar industry includes establishments manufacturing sugar or sirup from sugar cane, except that the product of mills located on farms and using 01tly the cane grown on the farms where they are situated has been included in the statistics of agriculture In the aggregate large quantities of sugar cane are crushed in these small farm mills, but the output is practically all sirup, so that the omission of their sugar product does not appreciably affect the statistics relating to the total production of cane sugar in the United States The sugar refining industry comprises only those establishments which were engaged exclusively (or practically so) in the refining of cane sugar There is some duplication in the cost of materials and the value of products shown for the three industries combined, by reason of the fact that a large part of the raw sugar, which constitutes the principal product of the \"sugar and molasses\" branch, is used as material by the re:f?neries Of the total amount of cane sugar refined, however, by far the larger part is imported -1 Figures for tbc total quantity of sugar manufactured are not available The combined output of the beet sugarindustry and tile sugar and molasses indllBtry, wth!ch ls approximately equal to the total production of domestic sugar, was 828,539 -There were 291 establishments in the United States engaged in the manufacture and refining of sugar and sirup in 1909 Of these, 58 were engaged in the man-ufacture of sugar from beets, 214 in the manufacture of sugar or sirup from cane, and 19 in the refining of cane sugar The total number of persons engaged in these three industries was 24,047, of whom 349 per cent were employed in the beet sugar factories, 221 per cent in the cane mills, and 43 per cent in the refinelies Although large mills with expensive equipment are required for the manufacture of sugar from beets, it may be stated that in a number of cases the value of the land on which the beets were grown, being owned by the companies, was included in the capital reported On the other hand, many of the mills which manufactuce sugar from cane (\"sugar and molasses\") are comparatively small and without very expensive machinery It should be noted also that the greater part of the beet sugar produced is refined, whereas the sugar from the cane mills is largely raw sugar The cane sugar refineries, although few in number, have very expensive plants and require a large capital investment, the capital reported averaging over $6,000,000 per establishment The processes used in the sugar refining branch are comparatively simple, however, and the value added by manufacture in this industTy formed only 9 per cent of the value of products, as compared with 433 per cent in the beet sugar industry, and 305 per cent in the -The quantity of beet sugar reported hi 1909 was 501,682 tons, valued at $45,937,629, and that of cane sugar 326,858 tons, valued at$26,095,673 Thequantity of refined sugar turned out by the refineries, which would include the product made from foreign raw sugar as well as from domestic cane sugar, was not reported In both the beet sugar industry and the industry producing Taw cane sugar the value of sugar manuf actured represents by far the greater part of the total value of products, the value of other products representing only 45 per cent of the total in the beet sugar industry, and 148 per cent in the sugar and molasses industry, the higher percentage in the latter case being due to the considerable amount of molasses and shup reported as a product -Scope of the industryThis industry includes all establishments making sugar from sugar beets The work done includes not only the extraction of the sugar from the beets but the refining of the greater part of the sugar, a f~ct which should be borne in _mind in comparing the statistics for the beet sugar mdustry with those for the cane sugar and moh1sses industry, in which the processes of manufacturing do not include the refining of the raw sugar produced -Except for the state of Michigan, it is impossible to publish statistics for the beet sugar industry by states without disclosing the operations of individual establishments For this reason, and also to permitï of a more detailed p1∑esentation of the statistics, the states -have bee~1 arra~ged_ in tl~~o groups, a method of presentat10n which, m add1t10n to preventing the disclosure of individual operations, brings under the same heading factories operated to a greater or less extent under similu,r conditions Group I includes Arizona, California, Oregon, and Washington In Arizona, and to a less degree in tho other states of this group, tho growers of boots d0p0nd upon iTrigation and, as u rule, planting and harvesting are earlier ~ th~se stntos tlrnn elsewhere in this country Group II 1s made up of tho states of Colorado, Idaho, Kansas Montana, Nebraska, nncl Utah In this group als~ the beets aro grown almost ent,irely upon irrigated land Group III includes the remaining states in the industryIllinois, !own, Michignn, Minne~ota, New York, Ohio, 11nd Wisconsin While tho conditions in this group arc not so uniform as are those in the other t,wo, they have this feature in common, that the beets are grown on nonirrig11ted land -The m~nufacture of beet sugar is an industry of comparatively recent development in the United States At the census of 1869, 2 establi<ihments, with 116 wage earners and products valued at $119 720 -were reported under the heading of sugar and molasses, beet and grape,\" the greater part of tho product doubtless being beet sugar The industry -last half of the decade The absolute increase, however was larger during the later period than during the ~arlier The value of products is made up almost entirely of the value of sugar, the molasses, beet pulp, and other byproducts being of relatively little importance The quantity of beets used increased during the decade from 794,658 tons to 3,965,356 tons, or 399 per cent, and the quantity of sugar manufactured from 81 729 tons to 501,682 tons, or 5138 per cent-Of the 58 establishments reporting for 1909, 12 were in the states of Group I, 26 in those of Group II, and 20 in those of Group III The actual number of active factories in each of these groups, however, was 13, 27, and 25, respectively The factories in the states of Group I employed 265 per cent of the total number of wage earners in the industry; those in the states of Group II, 471 per cent; and those in the states of Group III, 264 per cent Of the total value of products, Group I reported 26 per cent; Group II, 471 per cent; and Group III, 27 per cent The distribution of the value added by manufacture is somewhat different, Group I showing 302 per cent of the total; Group It 451 per cent; and Group III, 247 per cent The higher ratio between value added by manufacture and value of products in Group I is accounted for in part by the fact that the beets used in the factories of this group in 1909 were of a higher quality than those used in the other groups -Capacity of establishmentsThe growth of the industry is further illustrated by Table 3, which has been compiled from unofficial but reliable sources The table shows for each state the total number of factories and their total daily slicing capacity for the years 1909, 1904, and 1899 -The list of states having beet sugar factories in 1909 includes five that do not appear in the list of 1904 and seven not represented in that of 1899, while one state, New Mexico, is shown only for 1899 The total daily slicing capacity of the factories in 1909 was -52,750 tons, as compared with 35,900 tons in 1904 and 19,110 tons in 1899, the increase during the decade being 176 per cent Based on the daily slicing capacity of their mills, as reported for 1909, the three leading states in the beet sugar industry are Colorado, Michigan, and California, in the order named These states reported a combined slicing capacity equal to 679 per cent of the total for the United States, which is about the same as their proportion of the total number of factories -Persons engaged in the beet sugar industryTable 4 shows, for 1909, the number of persons engaged in the industry, classified according to occupational status and sex, and, in the case of wage earners, according to age also It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -The average number of persons engaged in the beet sugar industry during 1909 was 8,389, of whom 7,204, or 859 per cent, were wage earners; 320, or 38 per cent, proprietors and officials; and 865, or 103 per cent, clerks, this class including other subordinate salaried employees, Of the few females employed, practically the entire number were clerks The proportions which the three classes represent of the total number of persons engaged in the industry are practically the same in the three groups as for the industry as a whole -Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 5 gives the number of wage earners employed in the industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 -Because the best results are obtained byutilizfag the crop promptly, the beet sugar industry is a seasonal one, exhibiting a wide divergence in the nu~b~rs of wage earners for the several months The romimum number in 1909 was reported for February, when 2,206 wage earners, equal to only 131 per cent of the maximum for the year, were employed During the \"campaign,\" as the active period in the sugar industry is termed, nearly all the factories were operatecl continuously, the wage earners working in shifts of from lHto 12 hours each, seven days in the week With the e;rneption of two states, the bus:f season for the industry covers the three months of Oct_ober, November, and December, the months immediately following the beet harvest In Arizona the campaign begins in June, and in California in August -ExpensesAs stated in the Introduction, the census figures for expenses do not purport to represent the total cost of manufacture, since they take no account of interest or depreciation; hence they can not properly be used for determining profits Facts of interest can be brought out, however, concerning the relative importance of the different classes of expenses which were reported Table 1 shows the total expenses in the beet sugar industry in 1909 to have been $37,353,066, distributed as follows: Cost of materials, $27,265,170, or 73 per cent; wages, $4,808,446, or -tire amount at each census being steam power The amount of rented electric power increased from 5 horsepower in 1904 to 2,090 in 1909, while the horsepower of electric motors used for the distribution of power by means of current generated in the same establishment also shows a marked increase for the decade -Fuel consumedIn the beet sugar industry the kind of fuel used depends very largely on the locality In California, Arizona, and Kansas practically all the fuel used was oil, while in the other states it was largely bituminous coal, although some anthracite coal was used in Michigan and some wood in Oregon -Acreage planted and beets usedThe special schedule used in collecting the statistics for the beet sugar industry required a detailed statement regarding the quantity of beets used and the acreage planted to beets, and of the quantity and value of the different products manufactured Table 7 gives the acreage planted to beets, the quantity of beets used in the manufacture of sugar, the average percentage of sucrose, and the average coefficient of purity for the United States, as reported for the years 1909, 1904, and 1899, and for the three groups of states separately, as reported for 1909 and 1904 -The production of sugar beets in 1909, as returned on the farm schedules, was 3,932,857 tons, which was 32,499 tons less than the quantity returned on the manufacturers schedules This slight difference may be clue to a number of causes, among others, to the reporting of sugar beets, in some instances, under the heading of root forage crops on the farm schedule -The average yield of beets per acre for the United States in 1909 was 95 tons The highest average shown by any single report was 225 tons, the area yielding that average being 13 acres located in Utah, owned and operated by a beet sugar establishment Yields as low as 5 tons per acre were reported by some of the establishments in each of the three groups -The total production of beets for any specified year depends very much upon weather conditions, and consideration must be given to this fact in drawing conclusions from comparisons between the figures for different years The figures in the table do not purport to show the production of sugar beets in the country, but only the quantity used in the manufacture of beet sugar In ∑1909 some fields which had produced well were caught by an early frost and the crop was either entirely abandoned or only partially harvested In spite of this fact the average tonnage of beets per acre planted in the United States shows an increase of half a ton over the figure for 1904, indicating the efficiency of improved methods of cultivation, -The quality of the sugar beet is indicated by the \"percentage of sucrose\" and the \"coefficient of purity Both these terms relate to the sugar content, the former being the ratio of the weight of sugar to the weight of the whole beet, and the latter the ratio of sugar to the solid content of the beet -As shown in the table, the average percentage of sucrose for the United States was 161 in 1909, as compared with 15 per cent in 1904 and 143 per cent in 1899 These percentages show a steady increase in the sugar content of the beets produced Considerable variation in quality of beets is shown for the different localities, the average sugar content in the states of Group I being 18 per cent; in those of Group II, 151 per cent; and in those of GIOup III, 166 per cent In the operation of the beet sugar factory the coefficient of purity of the beets used is of great importance, as upon this depends to a considerable extent the cost of the separation of the sugar from the other solids The average for the United States was 841 per cent in 1909, as compared with 832 per cent in 1904, and 812 per cent in 1899 The coefficient of purity for the states of Group I was 848 per cent; for those of Group II, 831 per cent; and for those of Group III, 858 per cent The total sugar content of the 3,965,356 tons of beets used in 1909, based on the average of 161 per cent, was 638,422 -786 per cent of the theoretically possible total Thus more than onefilth of the total sugar content of the beets did not reach the form of sugar This difference represents the loss from deterioration in the beets before being used, the loss in the various processes of manufacture, and the amount left in the pulp and in the residual molasses Methods of payment for beets purchasedTwo methods are employed in determining the price to be paid for the beets purchased by the sugar factories One is the payment of a fixed price per ton, with a proviso, in some instances, that the beets must average not less than a certain percentage of sucrose The other is the sliding scale, where a stipulated price is paid for beets analyzing a specified percentage of sucrose, with an added amount for every additional per cent or a fraction of a per cent of sucrose -Of the 6,5 factories operated by the 58 establishments reporting for 1909, 30 purchased their entire supply of beets on the fixedprice basis and 8 on the slidingscale basis, while 27 used both methods, the reports indicat ing that about twothirds of the total quantity of beets -were purchased on the first basis Where the sliding scale was used in the purchase of beets, $450 per ton for beets analyzing 12 per cent sucrose was, in most instances, the basis, 33º cents per ton being added for every additional per cent of sucrose In the states comprising Groups r and II nearly the entire supply of beets was purchased on the fixedprice basis, while in those of Group III the slidingscale basis was most generally used -ProductsIn the early history of the beet sugar industry in the United States, sugar was the only product of commercial value, but with the develo1)ment of the industry attention has been paid to the utilization of the byproducts The few factories reporting no value for the pulp and molasses produced in 1909 generally returned these byproducts to the producers of the beets, probably with some concession in the price paid for the beets, or as an additional inducement for their cultivation -481 per cent; and those of Group III, 257 per cent The average quantity of sugar obtained per ton of beets used in the United States in 1909 was 253 pounds, as compared with 233 pounds in 1904, and 206 in 1899 The corresponding :figures for the three groups of states for 1909 ancl 1904, respectively, were as follows: For Group I, 292 pounds and 228 pounds; for Group II, 237 pounds and 239 pounds; and for Group III, 251 pounds and 229 pounds It thus appears that in general not only was the greatest amount of sugar obtained from beets containing the highest percentage of sucrose, but also a larger percentage of the sugar content was recovered, showing the desirability of securing beets that will test as high in sucrose as possible For this reason those engaged in the industry have found it fully as much to their advantage to direct their attention to the improvement of the beet as to the improvement of methods of sugar extraction Molasses and pulp, the other important products of the industry, are used largely in the preparation of stock feed -The principal statistics secured by the census inquiry of 1909 concerning the beet sugar factories are presented for the United States and the several groups of -states in Table 9, which gives tne number of estab lishments, the number of persons engaged in the industry, prnnary horsepower, capital invested, salaries, wages, cost of materials, miscellaneous expenses, value of products, and value added by manufacture -Comparative summaryAt the census of 1909 all establishments engaged in the manufacture of sugar and molasses from sugar cane were classified under the designation  sugar and molasses,\" while establishments engaged in the refining of cane sugar were classified under the designation \"sugar refining, not including beet sugar\" At previous censuses, however, these two classes of establishments were included as a single industry under the general classification \"sugar and molasses, refining\" In order that comparisons may be made with previous censuses, t1?,erefore, the combined statistics for the cane sugar mills and the sugar refineries for 1909 are presented in Table 10, together with the corresponding figures for 1904 and 1899 -The decrease in the number of establishments is due in part to the increasing use, especially in Louisiana, of large mills to crush the cane from a number of plantations, each of which formerly had its own mill, and partly to the discontinuance of small refineries -Detailed statistics for 1909Table 11 gives the detailed statistics for 1909 for establishments engaged in the manufacture of sugar or sirup direct from the cane (the industry designated \"sugar and molasses\") for the United States as a whole, for Louisiana, and for \"all other states\" -16 years of age and over ï Male Femaleïïï Under 16 years of age Male  Femaleïïïïïï Primary horsepower Gapital  -There were 214 establishments engaged in the manufacture of sugar or sirup from sugar cane in 1909 all but 10 of which were located in Louisiana Of the total number, 192 manufactured sugar or sugar and sirup, and 22 sirup only In addition to the establishments shown in the table there were 4 other estab-lishments in that state that manufactured sugar from cane during the census year, 2 of these being classified as sugar refineries, while the other 2 were operated in connection wit~ Penal institutions, and consequently do not come within the scope of the census inquiry Before the Civil War practically every planter had his own sugar mill, the number of these mills in 1849 in Louisiana alone being 1,490 The reduction in the, number of mills has been brought about by various causes, among which the following may be mentioned: Changes in labor conditions; the considerable cost of the machinery necessary to fit up a modern plantï improved methods of transporting cane to the mills many factories now operating small railways for thi~ purpose; and the more economical operation possible in the larger plants -Persons engaged in the industryTable 12 showst for 1909, the number of persons engaged in the industry, classified according to occupational status and sex,, and in the case of wage earners, according to age also  It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -try during 1909 was 5,313, of whom 590, or 111 per cent, were proprietors and officials; 596, or 112 per cent, clerks, this, class including other subordinate salaried employees; and 4,127, or 777 per cent, wage earners Of the 198 proprietors and firm members reported, 154 were males and 44 females The large proportion of female proprietors in this industry may be attributed to the fact that a number of the plantations which control sugar mills have passed by inheritance into the hands of female owners who have been returned as proprietors Of the total number of employees in the industry, 956 per cent were reported by Louisiana -I the number of wage earners employed in the industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative clay) of each month during the year 1909 for the United States as a -The industry is essentially a seasonal one The cane sugar \"campaign,\" as the time of harvesting and crushing the cane is termed, usually begins early in October and is at its height in November, continuing through December and to a limited extent into January The :maximum number of wage earners, 15,761, was reported for November, and the minim:1m number, 559, for February, the latter number bemg equal to only 35 per cent of the former -Prevailing hours of labor,The nature of the industry, affected as it is by the shortness of the season for harvesting the cane crop and the necessity of crushing it promptly to prevent deterioration, is such that many o:f the mills are operated day and night during the height of the campaign The practice of having two sets of workmen alternate in shifts of six hours each is quite common Of the total average number of wage earners, 3,920, or 95 per cent, were returned as working in establishments where the prevailing hours were 72 or more per week -Character of ownershipTable 14 presents statistics with respect to the character of ownership of establishments in the cane sugar and molasses industry for the census year 1909 -The conditions regarding ownership of establishments in this industry are in general widely different from those obtaining in most other industries Many of the sugar mills at the present time are owned by the interests which control the plantation on which the -mills are situated, and since a large proportion of the plantations are still owned by individuals and :firms, it is not surprising that 542 per cent of the total number of establishments were reported as under these two classes of ownershipJ and that less than twothirds of the total value of products was returned by establishments controlled by corporations -Size of EstablishmentsTable 15 presents statistics for 1909 for establishments grouped according to the value of their products -Fuel used,There were consumed in this industry in 1909, for generating power and otherwise, 576,475 tons of coal, 500 tons of coke, 43,242 cords of wood, 2,040,309 barrels of oil, and 262,000 feet of gas In addition, large quantities of bagasse, the pulp of the sugar cane from which the juice has been extracted, were also used for fuel No data were collected with regard to the quantity of this refuse product utilized, but practically all of the important mills use it for fuel to a greater or less extent -Materials usedThe special schedule used in collectmg the statistics for the cane sugar industry required a detailed report of the quantity and cost (or value) of the cane used Inquiry was also made as to the source of the cane supplythat is, whether it was grown on plantations controlled by the operators of the factories and cultivated either directly by them or by tenants, or was grown elsewhere Table 17 gives this information with regard to the cane used, together with the cost of other materials, for the United States as a whole, for Louisiana, and for all other states combined -Of the total quantity of cane crushed in the sugar mills, nearly threefifths (578 per cent) was grown on plantations controlled by the operators of the mills The cost of cane grown on plantations controlled by the operators, as returned by the latter, was based on current market prices and is not, therefore, the cost of -ProductsSupplementary data were obtained regarding the products made in the establishments which manufactured sugar Table 18 gives the quantity and value of the different products of these establishments for the United States as a whole, for the state of Louisiana, and for all other states -1 In addition 7,281 tons ol row cane augur nn<l 093,302 gallons of molasses wore made by establishments connected with two penal institutions and two establishï -842 per cent, were obtained on first strike; 41,975 tons, or 13 per cent, on second strike; and 9,094 tons, or 28 per cent, on third strike In this connection it should be stated that some lnills did not carry the process of manufacture beyond the firstand many not beyond the secondstrike, because of the lack of equipment to conduct further processes with profit The quantity and value of the molasses remaining as a byproduct are affected by the quantity of the sug~r content extracted Some of the mills extractedpract1-cally the entire amount of the available sugar content, in which case the molasses was worth only from 4 to 6 cents a gallon In many establishments, however, only a portion of the available sugar was extracted, and the molasses remaining was worth from ∑10 to 30 cents per gallon The total quantity of molasses reported was 24,587,581 gallons, with a total value of $2,845,559, or an average value of 116 cents per gallon Some of the mills reporting sugar also reported sirup, the liquid product from which no sugar has been extracted The total quantity of sirup reported by such mills was 1,449,860 gallons, valued at $365,632, the average value being 252 cents a gallon The quantity of sirup manufactured in the 22 mills which made no sugar was not obtained, and its value is included in the table under the heading \"all other products\" -Detailed statistics for 1909This industry, which is formally designated \"sugar refining, not including beet sugar,\" comprises those establishments which are engaged primarily in the refining of cane sugar Separate statistics for these establishments are presented for the first time, as already stated, at the census of 1909 At prior censuses the statistics of establishments engaged in refining sugar were combined with those which manufactured sugar and molasses from cane and those engaged in the compounding of table sirups The manufacturing operations in the cane mills n,nd in the refineries are, however, so dissimilar and distinct that the statistics for each are shown separately for 1909 -Table 19 gives detailed statistics for the sugar refining industry for 1909 Corresponding figures can -The gross value of products amounted to $248,628,659 and the value added by manufacture (value of products less cost of materials) to $22,340,699 No data were collected showing the value of the different products manufactured, but practically the entire amount is represented by the value of refined sugar -Persons engaged in the industryTable 20 shows, for 1909, the number of persons engaged in the industry, classified according to occupational status and sex, and, in the case of wage earners, according to age also It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 21 gives the number of wage earners employed in the industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 -Prevailing hours of laborThe wage earners in the industry have been classified according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or smaller number of hours -No wage earners were reported as employed in establishments where the prevailing hours were less than 60 per week Nearly onehalf (485 per cent) of the wage earners in the industry in 1909 were in refineries where the prevailing hours wore 60 per week The second largest group was made up of those in establishments where the prevailing hours were 72 or over per week, which group :formed 315 per cent of the total -General description of the industryThe manufacture of sugar from cane is the most important industry in Hawaii, contributing 758 per cent of the total value of products for all manufacturing industries in 1909 Only three cbuntriesOuba, British India, and Javaproduce more cane sugar than Hawaii -Practically every important cane growing plantation on the island has its own sugar mill, built primarily for crushing the cane grown on the plantation In some instances, however, the plantation mills crush cane grown on other plantations, while a few mills are engaged exclusively in crushing cane grown by others The most modern machinery and equipment have been installed in the mills and a high percentage of sugar is extracted, the molasses remaining as a byproduct being practically worthless, except for fertilizer or cattle feed Nearly 20 per cent of the raw sugar used by the refineries in continental United States is obtained from Hawaii, 491,545 tons having been imported during the fiscal year 1909 The statistics for Hawaii are not included in the preceding tables, which are confined to establishments in continental United States -Growth of the industry Hawaii was annexed to the United States in 1898 and organized as a territory in 1900, and was included in the census of 1899, which was the first enumeration of its manufactures The industrial census of 1904, however, was confined to continental United States and no canvass was made of Hawaii Table 23 gives the more important figures relative to the sugar industry on the island, as returned at the censuses of 1909 and 1899, together with the percentages of increase for the 10year period -As already stated, practically all of the sugar factories in Hawaii are located on and operated in connection with sugar plantations The employees engaged on the plantations frequently work in the sugar factory and in many ~stances the expenses_ of the factory are so mingled with those for the operat10n of the plantation that it is impossible to obtain sepa-∑ate statistics of the number of employees or the expenses of the factory as distinct from those of the plantation It is possible that at the census of 1899 a larger or smaller proportion of the number of employees and expenses for some plantations was assigned to the factories than was so assigned at the census of 1909, though it is probable that these differences are not sufficient seriously to affect the comparability of the figures reported for the two censuses ∑ -Exports of sugar,Practically all of the sugar production of Hawaii is exported to the United States in the form of raw sugar, the iJnports from Hawaii forming nearly onefifth of the total amount of raw cane sugar used in the refineries of continental United States The statistics of exports of sugar and molasses for specified years from 1875 to 1910, inclusive, as taken from the Hawaiian Annual, 1913, are summarized in Table 24 -Prior to 1905 there were no sugar refineries m Hawaii In that year, however, one was established, and since that time sugar has been refined for the Hawaiian market as well as for export The quantity -Development of the industryThe sugar industry was first established in Porto Rico in 1548, but its growth was slow, the total production in 1830 being only 15,757 tons While some establishments still employ the primitive openkettle method of manufacture, a number have installed modern machinery and methods, with greatly increased economy in the production of sugar, and the total output in 1909 amounted to 283,223 tons The census of manufactures of 1909 was the first taken in Porto Rico, and comparative statistics are, therefore, not available -There were 108 establishments engaged in the manufacture of sugar and molasses in Porto Rico in 1909 Of these, 85 were controlled by individuals and :firms, thus accounting for the relatively large number of proprietors and firm members The aggregate value of products was $20,569,348, of which $20,164,887 represented the value of sugar Many of the mills are small, 48 of them reporting products valued at less than $5,000 It is probable that, _in the case of some of the mills located on plantations, the expenses were so interwoven with those for the operation of the plantation that they could not be segregated -Exports of sugarTable 26 gives the quantity of sugar exported from Porto Rico for specified ;years Practically the whole quantity exported in recent years has been taken by the United States -ao and are taken from the reports or the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic omï merce, Department of Commerce -Summary for the industry: 1909Table 1 presents a summary of the statistics for the lumber industry as a whole for 1909 It distinguishes four classes of establishments: (1) Logging camps and merchant sawmills, including planing mills where operated in connection with sawmills; (2) independent planing mills; (3) wooden packingbox factories; and (4) custom sawmills Small establishments engaged primarily in work on materials owned by others are classified as custom mills, while establishments manufacturing products from materials which they own and large establishments doing contract sawing are classified as merchant -mills The establishments included in the first class comprise all merchant sawmills using logs or bolts as materials and also all logging camps, while those not using these materials are assigned to the second or the third group according to their product of chief value So many of the merchant mills in the industry carry on two or all three classes of operations, however, that only the totals for all branches combined are shown in the general tables Statistics for custom mills are given in Tables 1, 2, 22, and 25 of this report, all other tables showing statistics for merchant establishments exclusively -The extent to which the first three classes of establishments shown in the table overlap is indicated by the fact that in 1909 the valiie of the dressed lumber and other planingmill products reported by sawmills amounted to $222,325,705, which is equal to 679 per cent of the total value of the products reported by independent planing mills rhe cost of materials, labor, etc, involved in the manufacture of these products could not be separated from those for the production of rough lumber In like manner many planing mills manufactured boxes, but the statistics for this branch of their business, or even the value of the boxes produced, could not be segregated -added by manufacture (that is, the value of products less cost of materials) was $652,429,475 The figures for cost of materials and value of products involve a considerable amount of duplication for the reason that the same lumber may undergo manufacturing processes in two or three diffe1∑ent establishments, its value figuring both in the cost of materials and in the value of products for each establishment Where logging operations are concerned, the cost of materials includes the value of the standing timber even when owned by the operator -In addition to the products for which figures are given in Table 1, lumber and its more elementary products to the value of $5,667,950 were reported for 1909 by establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of other products, chiefly furniture and refrigerators, fancy and paper boxes, and pianos and organs and materials Thes~ products, however, are not included in the product whose value is given in Table 1 On the other hand, the value of products shown in -Table 1 includes $1,002,731 representing receipts from the custom grinding of flourmill and gristmill products and $5,730,556 representing the value of foundry and machineshop products, cooperage and wooden goods, and other subsidiary products reported for 1909 by establishments in the lumber industry -92 per cent were custom mills, these mills employing only 1 per cent of the wage earners in the industry and contributing only fourtenths of 1 per cent of the total value of products The small proportion of the total value of products reported by such mills results from the fact that their value of products consists almost entirely of the amounts received for work done, the value of the lumber sawed which is owned by others not being included Merchant sawmills and logging camps formed more than fourfifths of the total number of merchant establishments in the industry in 1909, the value of their products amounting∑ to $753,388,368, or 652 per cent of the total for merchant establishments and 649 per cent of that for all establishments combined, while they gave employment to 547,178 wage earners, or 779 per cent of the total number in the industry and 787 per cent of those in merchant establishments The principal products of logging camps are saw logs; shingle, stave, and heading bolts; telegraph and telephone poles; fence posts; and hewed railway ties Those of sawmills include rough lumber, shingles, cooperage materials, veneers, lath, and sawed railway ties When the logging and sawing are done by the same concern, there is no duplication in value of products, but so far as logs are purchased from other establish:rnents in the industry there is duplication -The 61402 independent planing mills reported for 1909 formed 157 per cent of the total number of merchant establishments in the industry and gave employment to 162 per cent of the wage earners in merchant establishments and 16 per cent of those in the industry as a whole, while the value of their products formed -283 per cent of the total for merchant establishments and 282 per cent of the total for all establishments combined The establishments included in this subclassification manufacture principally dressed lumber; sash, doors, and blinds; interior woodwork; and moldings Among the minor products are cattle stanchions water tubs and cisterns, wooden tanks, wooden pipe and wooden covering for water and steam pipes -The 1,179 wooden packingbox factories reported formed 29 per cent of the total number of merchant establishments in the lumber industry, employed 51 per cent of the wage earners in such establishments and contributed 65 per cent of the total value of prod~ ucts Box shooks; wooden boxes used for packing; crates for butter, fruits, and vegetables; egg cases; carrier trays; and wine cases are the principal products reported for establishments included under this subdassification Many manufacturing concerns in a variety of industries make packing boxes for their own products, but the census schedules did riot call for the value of such containers as a separate itj}m and statistics for them are not included in this report -Comparison with previous censusesThe census of 1909 was the first at which the establishments constituting the lumber industry were united under a single classification At the censuses of 1904 and 1899 three independent classifications were employed: -(1) \"Lumber and timber products,\" corresponding practically to the present subclassification of logging camps and merchant sawmills; (2) \"lumber, planingmill products, including sash, doors, and blinds,\" the scope of which was the same as that of the second subclassification for 1909; and (3) \"boxes, wooden packing,\" corresponding to the third subdassification at present employed At the present census, however, it was deemed best, on account of the large amount of overlapping between the different classifications, to combine them all under a single head At  censuses prior to 1899 the establishments constituting the lumber industry as at present defined were included under a number of independent classifications -Table 2 summarizes the statistics of the lumber industry (merchant establishments and custom establishments combined) for each census from 1859 to 1909, inclusive, the statistics for the various independent classifications into which the lumber industry as at present defined was divided at the different censuses being combined -1 A mrns Blgn () denotes decrea~e Where percentages are omitted, comparablï figures are not available Comparable figures not availllble, ï Figures not stnotly comparable -The reports for the censuses prior to 1899 included, without distinction, both merchant mills and custom mills As custom mills were not canvassed at the census of 1904, no statistics for that year are shown -The :financial :figures for 1869 in this and other tables are given in currency, which at that time was worth only about 80 cents, gold, to the dollar For strict comparison, therefore, these :figures should be reduced about 20 per cent -The growth of the industry, as measured by the increase in vahie of products, was more rapid during the decade 18591869 than during any other decade covered by the table, although the actual increase in value of products for the decade was somewhat less than that shown in the table, owing to the fact, already noted, that the :financial :figures for 1869 were reported in a depreciated currency The smallest relative increase in value of products shown for any decade covered by the table was that for the decade 18691879 -(72 per celit) This, however, is due entirely to the fact that the figures for 1869 were reported in depreciated currency, as when allowance is made for this the smallest relative increase is shown for the decade 18891899 As already stated, the establishments constituting the first branch of the lumber industry, as at present defined, constituted an independent industry under the classification employed at the censuses of 1904 and 1899, being included under the designation \"lumber and timber products,\" which is now employed for the industry as a whole -Statistics for sawmills and logging camps, as reported for each census from 1859 to 1909, are given in the following table, the separate classes shown at the -earlier censuses being combined The statistics are roughly comparable, although the figu∑:es for censuses prior to 1899 include those for the custom mills -The manufacture of the various classes of planingmill products by independent mills was shown for the first time atthe census of 1889 under the classification \"lumber, planingmill products, including sash, doors, and blinds,\" this classification, as already noted, also being used at the censuses of 1899 and 1904 and corresponding practically to the second branch of the industry as at present defined In 1879 two separate classifications were employed, \"lumber, planed,\" and \"sash, doors, and blinds\" In 1869 the same classifications were employed as in 1879, together with the additional classification \"wood brackets, moldings, and scrolls\" In 1859 the classifications \"pump logs,\" \"drainpipe, wooden,\" and \"splints\" were employed in addition to \"lumber, planed,\" and \"sash, doors, and blinds\" -The statistics for the manufacture of planingmill products are given in the following table for each census from 1859 to 1909, jnclusive, the various classifications employed for the establishments manufacturing such products at the earlier censuses being combined As already stated, the large planingmill business clone in connection with sawmills is not covered by the table -The decrease in the value of products of the planingmill branch of the lumber industry between 1889 and 1899 was due to the increasing extent to which lumber was planed in establishments classified as sawmills The apparent decrease between 1869 and 1879 results from the fact, already mentioned, that the value for -The classification \"boxes, wooden packing,\" under which the establishments constituting the third branch of the industry were included at censuses prior to that of 1909, was :first employed at the census of 1879 In 1869 \"boxes, cheese,\" and \"boxes, tobacco\" (not cigar boxes), were shown separately from \"boxes, wooden packing\" In 1859 statistics were presented for the manufacture of \"boxes, sugar,\" tmd of \"box shooks,\" as well as of cheese, tobacco, and packing boxes The :figures for these separate classifications have been combined for the various years in Table 5 -The most important statistics for the three classes of merchant establishments in the lumber industry, as reported at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899, are given in Table 6 AB already noted, custom mills were not segregated from merchant mills at censuses prior to that of 1899 -In general this table indicates a considerable growth during the decade The relative increase in number of wage earners and value of products was much greater during the last half of the decade than during the fust -The very considerable increase in number of establishments shown by the census of 1909 results in part from the fact that the canvass of that year was more complete than that of any previous census, and par-ticularly than that of 1904 The additional establishments covered by this more complete canvass were for the most part small, however, so that the statistics for items other than number of establishments and number of proprietors and fum members are not materially affected -Summary, by statesTable 7 summarizes the more important statistics of the merchant establishments in the industry by states, the states being arranged according to the value of products reported for 1909 -The lumber industry is widely distributed throughout the United States, some establishments being reported for every state Washington was in 1909 the most important state as measured by value of products and value added by manufacture, and ranked second in number of wage earners New York, which ranked second among the states in value of products, was ninth in number of wage earners and filth in value added by manufacture Louisiana ranked third in value of products, but :first in number of wage earners and second in value added by manufacture The wide distribution of the industry is indicated by the fact that the five leading states reported only 269 per cent of the total numbe1∑ of wage earners and 298 per cent of the total value of products -Of the 11 states that reported products valued at $40,000,000 or over, Louisiana shows the most rapid development during the period 18991909, the number of wage earners increasing 2023 per cent, the value of products 229 per cent, and the value added by manufacture 2651 per cent Still higher percentages of increase are shown for Idaho, Oldahoma, and New Mexico, in which states, however, the industry has attained comparatively little importance Louisiana shows the largest relative increase in value of products for the :fiveyear period 19041909 of any of the leading states (638 per cent), also showing the largest increase in number of wage earners (653 per cent) -(291 per cent) being in Indiana and the largest in value of products (151 per cent) in Wisconsin There was considerable change in the rank of the different states in value of products at the two censuses Among the more important states in the industry, Washington advanced from filth place in 1904 to fust in 1909; Louisiana advanced from seventh to third place; and Mississippi from thirteenth to ninth Wisconsin, which ranked second in value of products in 1904, had dropped to filth place in 1909; Pennsylvania, which was fourth in 1904, had dropped to sixth in 1909; and Minnesota, which was sixth in 1904, was tenth in 1909 -WASHINGTON NEW YORK LOUISIANA MICHIGAN WISCONSIN PENNSYLVANlA 1 CALIFORNIA ILLINOIS MISSISSIPPI MINNESOTA ARKANSAS VIRGINIA OHIO NORTH

-Summary: 1909Table 8 shows for 1909 the number of persons engaged in the operation of all merchant establishments in the industry, and of each of the three classes separately, classified according to occupational status and sex, and in the case of wage earners according to age also It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -In the merchant sawmills and logging camps, 892 per cent of all persons engaged were wage earners, 88 per cent proprietors and officials, and 2 per cent clerks The corresponding percentages for the independent planing mills were 848, 9, and 61, respectively, and for the wooden packing box factories, 912, 58, and 31, respectively -Of the total number of women employed in the merchant establishments of the industry, 437 per cent were in the sawmills and logging camps, 322 per cent in the independent planing mills, and 241 per cent in the packing box factories Of the children under 16 years, 544 per cent were in the sawmills and logging camps, 182 per cent in the independent planing mills, and 274 per cent in the packing box factories -The average number of wage earners in each state for 1909, 1904, and 1899 is given in Table 23 The sex and age distribution of the average number is not shown for the individual states, but Table 24 gives such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, 1909, or the nearest representative day -In order to compare ïthe distribution of the persons engaged in the industry in 1909 according to occupational status with that in 1904, it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 9 -The number of women employed as wage earners in merchant establishments and the proportion which they formed of the total shows comparatively little change during the decade The number of children employed shows a decrease for the decade as a whole, although somewhat larger in 1909 than in 1904; the proportion which they formed of the total, however, decreased during each intercensal period -Wage earners employed in merchant establishments, by monthsTable 12 gives the number of wage earners employed in all merchant establishments in the industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 for the 44 states in which an average of more than 500 wage earners were employed during the year -The months of maximum and minimum employment for 1909, and the number of wage earners reported for these months, are given for all the states in Table 24 -1 The month of maximum employment !or each state is indicated by boldface figures and that of minimum employment by itaUc figures-Since the work of sawmills is to a great extent indoor work, while that of logging camps is outdoor work, the seasonal distribution of employment in the two differ considerably This is shown in the following table, which gives the number of wage earners in merchant sawmills and in logging camps on the 15th or nearest representative day of each month of 1909 -As shown by tho table the maximum employment of wage earners in the logging camps of the country took place during the winter, and ih the lumber mills during the summer and foll Conditions with respect to distribution of employment during the year differ widely, however, in clifferent sections of the country -In the Northern states most of the logging is done during the winter months while the lumber mills run throughout the year, being usually somewhat more active during the summer than during the winter In the Southern states, on the other hand, both logging and mill work continue with little change or interruption throughout the year Thus, there were more than four times as many wage earners employed in the logging camps of New England in December of 1909 as were employed in July of that year In the logging operations of the five states bordering on the Gulf of Mexico, on the other hand, there were only -Prevailing hours of labor in merchant establishmentsIn Table 14 the wage earners in merchant establishments have been classified according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or smaller number of hours -More than fourfilths (809 per cent) of the wage earners employed in the industry were in establishments where the prevailing hours were 60 or more per week Of the seven groups shown in the table, by far the largest was that made up of the wage earners in establishments where the prevailing hours were 60 per week, such wage earners constituting 675 per cent of the total number Sixty hours per week was the most common working time in 38 of the 44 states for which figures are given, while in Illinois, MassachusettB, Nebraska, and Rhode Island the most common -working time was 54 but less than 60 hours per week and in Montana and New Jersey it was 54 hours pef week -Table 15 presents statistics with respect to the ch~acter of ownership of the merchant establishments in the lumber and timber industry -Between 1904 and 1909 there was a decided decrease both in the relative number of estabfoihments under firm ownership and in the proportion which they reported of the total value of products, while there was an :increase in the relative number of establishments operated by individuals, but a slight decrease in their relative importance as measured by value of products Of the 18 establishments operated under forms of ownership other than individual, firm, or corporate in 1909, 15 were controlled by cooperative associations -Table 16 gives statistics for merchant establishments classified according to form of ownership for each state for which more than 500 wage earners were reported at the census of 1909 The 18 establishments under\" other\" forms of ownership have in this table been included with those under corporate ownership -There is considerable variation among the states as to the relative importance of the establishments operated under the different forms of ownership Thus in Washington, the leading state in the industry, establishments operated by corporations constituted -52 per cent of the total number of all establishments l:ishments constituted only 114 per cent of the total in the industry, gave employment to 852 per cent 0£ number of establishments, gave employment to 388 all wage earners, and reported 861 per cent of the per cent of the wage earners, and reported 475 per total value of products, while in Maryland such estabcent of the total value of products -NOTE,The figures !or establishments under corporate ownership include those for tbe few comparatively unimportunt establlshments operated by cooperative-Classification by value of productsTable 17 presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for merchant establishments grouped according to the value of their products -In 1909, 62 per cent of the merchant establishments reported products valued at $100,000 and over, as against 82 per cent in 1904 While such establishments represented a comparatively small proportion of the total number at both censuses they reported -Classification by number of wage earners,Table 18 gives a classification of the merchant establishments engaged in the industry according to the number of wage earners employed for each state in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed in 1909 -were reported by establishments employing from 1 to 5 wage earners, 189 per cent by establishments employing from 6 to 20, 15 per cent by establishments employing from 21 to 50, 133 per cent by establishments employing from 51 to 100, 347 l)er cent by establishments employing from 101 to 500, and 102 per cent by establishments employing over 500 The most important single group was that comprising the wage earners in establishments employing from 101 to 250 wage earners, who represented 204 per cent of the total for merchant establishments -There is comparatively little difference between planing mills and wooden packing box factories with respect to the relative importance of the several classes of expenses In the case of sawmills and logging camps, however, the cost of materials represents a smaller proportion, and \"miscellaneous expenses\" and wages represent larger proportions of the total -Considerable variation appears in the proportions of total expenses represented by the different classes of expenses in the several states, as shown by tha :figures in table 24 -1 Comparable figures not available Includes other kinds of primary power ï Not reported t Less than onetenth of 1 per cent -127 per cent for the decade, representing only 49 per cent of the total primary power in 1909, as compa1∑ed with 96 per cent in 1899 The most notable increase during the decade is that for rented electric power, the amount reported in 1909 (62,200 horsepower) being over thirty times that reported for 1899 The number and horsepower of electric motors used for distributing power by means of current generated in the establishments also show a very great increase Table 21 shows, for 1909, by states, statistics of the power and of the fuel used :in merchant establishments -The states which in 1909 ranked highest with respect to the amount of primary power used were Washington, Louisiana, :Mississippi, Michigan, New York, Wisconsin, Arkansas, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Alabama in the order named; each of these 10 states reported a total of more than 100,000 horsepower, their aggregate horsepower representing 48 2 per cent of the total for all merchant establishments Steam was the most important form of power in all of the states shown separately, the largest amount being shown for Washington The largest amount of water power is shown for Maine, the largest amount of rented electric power for California, and the largest amount of power developed by gas and other internalcombustion engines for Pennsylvania -Fuel consumedBituminous coal was the principal class of fuel reported Gas was used to a considerable extent, 254 per cent of the total being reported from West Virginia The figmes in the table do not represent all the fuel consumed in merchant establishments, -since many such establishments in the industry used sawdust, slabs, edgings, and other mill waste, and the amount of such fuel used was not reported -It is necessary, in gtving detailed statistics of t~e lumber production in 1909, to use the figures shown m the annual report on lumber, lath, and shingles issued by the Bureau of the Census in cooperation with the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture (Forest Products of the United States, 1909) This report contained figures for a number of establishments whic~, because of their small output or of the fact that theuprincipal products were such as to cause them to be included in the\" manufactures statistics under another classification than \"lumber and timber products,\" are not included in the preceding tables of this report Consequently the output of the establishments covered by the annual report on forest products is somewhat greater than that of the establishments in the l?mber industry proper and is not strictly comparable with the -∑ statistics of the output of the lumber industry as compiled at the censuses of 1904 and 1899 lhe statistics for 1899 in Table 22, however, include small custom mills, and are for this reason more nearly comparable with those for 1909 than are the figures for 1904, which are confined to the logging camps and merchant mills -Since the nature of the products of the planing mills and box factories is such as not to permit of satisfactory reports in detail, the only products of the lumber industry for which :figures are shown are lumber, lath, -and shingles It will of course be understood that the value of products for 1909 in Table 22 represents only the value of rough lumber, lath, and shingles, while the value of products of the sawmill branch of the lumber industry as shown in Table 1 and other tables in this report covers, in addition to rough lumber and lath and shingles, dressed lumber, tight and slack cooperage stock, crossties, poles, posts, masts, spars, excelsior stock, etc, together with the products reported for the independent logging camps -The principal statistics secured by the census inquiry concerning the merchant establishments in the lumber industry are presented by states in Tables 23 and 24, Table 23 showing for 1909, 1904, and 1899 the number of merchant establishments in the industry, number of persons engaged, primary horsepower, -capital invested, salaries, wages, cost of materials, value of products, and value added by manufacture, and Table 24 giving more detailed statistics for the merchant establishments for 1909 only -1 Excludes statistics for two establishments, to avoid cllsclosure of individual operations  Includes Indian Territory in 1904 and 1899, -ï Excludes statistics for one establishment, to avoid disclosure of individual operations \\x0cMANUFACTURES -The statistics relating to the manufacture of musical instruments are presented in the general report on manufactures for the United States as a whole under two main classifications: (1) \"Musical instruments, pianos and organs and materials,\" and (2) \"Musical instruments and materials, not specified\" The prod-ucts of the establishments assigned to these two classifications are so dissimilar that a combination of the totals would have little significance The industry covered by the firstnamed classification is much the more important of the two and is therefore treated at greater length -Summary for the three branches of the industry: 1909Table 1 presents a summary of the statistics of the piano and organ industry as a whole for 1909 It also distinguishes three classes of establishments, as follows: -ï 1 In addition, parts and materials to the value of $680,188 were made by establrnhments ongaged primarily in the manufacture of products other than those covered by the industry designation The establishments in the first subclass manufactured chiefly upright and grand pianos with and without player attachments Twenty of the establishments in this subclass also manufactured organs to the value of $1,524,354; 23 manufactured player attachments to the value of $1,474,630; 14 reported the manufacture of perforated music rolls to the value of $212,925; and 46 made parts, materials, and supplies -to the value of $2,112,320 Of the 86 establishments engaged chiefly in the manufacture of organs, there were 3 that also manufactured pianos to the value of $188,321; 12 that manufactured parts, materials, and supplies to the value of $330,291; and 3 that manufactured perforated music rolls to the value of $3,225 The 127 establishments in the third subclass manufactured chiefly parts and materials used in the production of pianos and organs, but some of them made also parts and materials for other musical instruments Because of this overlapping of the several branches of the industry, only combined totals for all three branches are presented in the tables in Volumes VIII and IX of the census reports -The total value of products and the total cost of materials for the piano and organ industry as a whole contain considerable duplication, since the products of the establishments chiefly engaged in the manufacture of parts and supplies were largely used as materials by establishments manufacturing pianos and organs -The establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of pianos in 1909 turned out products to the value of $66,569,273, or ∑741 per cent of the total value of products of the three branches of the industry combined The value of the products reported by the establishments engaged chiefly in the manufacture of organs ($4,745,655) represented 53 per cent of the total for all three branches, and the value of the products reported by the establishments engaged chiefly in the manufacture of piano and organ parts and materials ($18,474,616) represented 206 per cent of the total value of products for the three branches -of persons engaged, 678 per cent were employed m the piano branch of the industry, 66 per cent in the organ branch, and 256 per cent in the parts and materials branch -Comparison with earlier censusesTable 2 summarizes the statistics for the manufacture of pianos and organs and piano and organ materials as reported at each census from 1869 to 1909, inclusive The :financial figures for 1869 are given in currency, which at that time was worth only about 80 cents, gold, to the dollar For strict comparison, therefore, these figures should be reduced about 20 per cent -1 A minus sign() denotes decrease Where percentages are omitted, comparable figures itre not availitble -The decrease in the number of proprietors and firm members is no doubt due to the growth in the corporate form of ownership On the other hand, there was an increase of 1348 per cent during the decade ending with 1909 in the number of salaried employees -The censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1859 are the only censuses for which separate statistics are available for establishments whose chief products were pianos and organs, respectively, and the censuses of 1909 and 1904, the only ones for which separate statistics are available for establishmeuts engaged chiefly in the manufacture of piano and organ parts and materials The figures for the three classes of establishments at these censuses are summarized in Table 3 -Summary, by statesTable 4 summarizes the more important statistics for the establishments engaged in the manuiacture of pianos and organs and materials, by states, the states being arranged according to the value of products reported for 1909 -In determining the rank of the states all states are considered, whether or not they are shown separately in the table; hence some omissions occur in the several series of numbers indicating rank, as certain states -included under \"all other states\" held a higher rank in some items than some of the states for which separate :figures are given -Although statistics are shown for 17 states separately, more than twothirds (69 per cent) of the total value of products were reported by the first three states New York reported 37 5 per cent of the total and Illinois 214 per cent Wisconsin shows the greatest relative increase for the fiveyear period -19041909, a<lvancing from fiiteenth place in value of products in 1904 to twelfth place in 1909 Michigan also shows a marked gain in rank during this period, advancing from eighth to filth Most of the states held the same, or nearly the same, rank in 1909 as in 1904, and, in general, the states had in 1909 the same, or nearly the same, rank in number of wage earners and value added by manufacture as in value of products -Summary, 1909Table 5 shows, for 1909, the number of persons engaged in the piano and organ industry as a whole and in each of the three branches, classified according to occupational status and sex, -and in the case of wage earners according to age It should bo borne in mind that the sex and ago classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -56 per cent, were females The largest number of females, J,413, or 659 per cent of the total, was reported for the manufacture of piano and organ materials Females formed 139 per cent of the total number of wage earners in this branch of the industry The total number of wage earners under 16 years of age (704) for the three brMches of the industry combined formed but 19 per cent of the total number of wage earners in the industry as a whole, and was about equally divided between the piano branch and the piano and organ materials branch, only 17 being reported for the organ branch Comparison with previous censuses for the United States as a wholeIn order to compare the distribution of persons engaged in the industry in 1909 with that in 1904, it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (see Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 6 for the industry as a whole -Although there was an increase of 149 per cent in the average number of wage earners in the industry -as a whole from 1904 to 1909, they constituted a smaller proportion of the total number of persons engaged in 1909 than in 1904 There was an increase of 31 per cent in the number of salaried employees but the number of proprietors and fam member~ decreased -Table 7 shows the average number of wage earners in the industry as a whole, distributed according to age, and in the caso of those 16 years of age and over according to sex, for 1909, 1904, and 1899 The most important fact brought out by this table is the increase during the decade in the employment of female wage earners 1G years of ago and over, this class forming 52 per cent of the total number of wage earners in 1909 as compared with 26 per cent in 1899 -The average number of wage earners employed in the industry in 1909, 1904, and 1899, is given for each state in Table 20 The average number distributed by sex and age is not shown for the individual states, but Table 21 gives such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, or the nearest representative day -Wag∑e earners employed, by monthsTable 8 gives, for the industry as a whole, the number of wage earners employed on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 for the 11 states in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed during the year -1 The month of maximum employment for each state is indicated by boldface figures and that of minimum employment by italic figures, -month, but, like most manufacturing industries, has its busier and its duller searsons, depending on the demands of the trade In 1904 December was the month of greatest employment, with 35,143, and July the month of least employment, with 31,498 In 1909 December was the month of maximum employment in New York and Massachusetts, the fast and third states in the industry, while October was the month of maximum employment in Illinois, the second state in importance The months of maximum and minimum employment for 1909 and the number of wage earners reported for these months are given for each state in Table 21 -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 9 the wage earners in the industry as a whole, for the 11 leading states, are classified according to the prevailing hours of labor per week in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment is classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or a smaller number of hours -In five of the eleven states for which separate data are shown, 54 hours per week was the most common period of employment, these states including the three leading states in the industry, New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts -Table 10 presents statistics with respect to the character of ownership of establishments in the piano and organ industry -The most important distinction shown is that between corporate and all other forms of ownership In 1909, of the total number of establishments, 619 per cent were under corporate ownership, as compared with 527 per cent in 1904 While corporations thus controlled less than twothirds of the total number of establishments in both years, the value of the products of these establishments represented 85 7 per cent of the total for the :industry in 1909 and 815 per cent in 1904 Between 1904 and 1909 there was an actual decrease in the number of establishments under individual ownership, but an increase in the value of their products The number of establishments under firm ownership was practically the same at the two censuses, but there was an absolute decrease of $999,456, or 169 per cent, in the value of their products from 1904 to 1909 -Table 11 gives, for 1909, statistics for establishments classified according to form of owne:rship for each of the 11 stittes in which more than 500 wage earners were employed in this industry -In 1909, of the entire number of wage earners, 2,751, or 7 2 per cent of the total, were employed in establishments under individual ownership; 2,547, or 67 per cent, in those under firm ownership; and 32,722, or 861 per cent, in those controlled by corporations Corporations do by far the greater part of the business∑ in each of the 11 states for which figures are presented In New York establishments under individual ownership reported 17 1 per cent of the total value of products for the state, and those under firm ownership 85 per cent, these percentages being higher than those for the corresponding classes of establishments in any other state listed -NOTEIn some states in order to avoid disclosing the returns for individual establishments, the figures for one group ha_ve been consolidated with those for establish, meuts under another lormof ownership In such cases an (X) is placed in the colunm from which the figures have lleen omitted and the figures for the l,l∑oup with which the,have been combined are printed in italics -Classification according to value of products,Table 12, relating to the entire industry in the United States as a whole, presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for establishments grouped according to the value of their products -ers,Table 13 gives for 1909 a classification of the establishments engaged in the industry as a whole according to the number of wage earners and shows the average number of wage earners employed by establishments of each group in each of the 11 states 1n which 500 or more wage earners were employed -As stated in the Introduction, the census figures for expenses do not purport to represent the total cost of numufactltre, since they take no account of interest or depreciation, and consequently can not properly be used for determining profits Facts of interest can be brought out, however, concerning the relative importance of the different classes of expenses which were reported Table 2 shows the total reported expenses in the combined industry to have been $80,750,525, distributed as follows: Cost of materials, $43,764,737, or -Engines and powerTable 15 shows the number of engines or other motors, according to their character, -employed in generating power (including electric motors operated by purchased current), and their total horsepower, as reported at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899 It also shows separately the number and horsepower of electric motors, including those operated by current generated in the establishments using them -24 per cent in 1899 The power of gas and other internal combustion engines and of water wheels used is relatively small, and although the combined total for these forms of power increased considerably during the decade 18991909, their proportion of the total primary power remained practically the same The number and horsepower of electric motors used for distributing power by means of current generated in the establishments shows a great increase during the decade Table 16 shows, for 1909, the amount of each of the several kinds of power and of the different kinds of fuel used in the combined industry in the 11 leading states -Of the 507 establishments in the industry as a whole 430, or 848 per cent, reported power The three leading states in the industryNew York, Illinois, and Massachusettstogether reportetl 564 per cent of the total horsepower Steam power was the most important in all of the states for which separate :figures are shown, except for Ohio, in which state rented electric power was slightly more important Ohio led in the horsepower reported for gas and other internal combustion engines, ∑with 39 per cent of the total -Fuel consumedIn the industry as a whole and in each of the states for which figures are given separately in the table, bituminous coal was the principal fuel used, a total of 202,934 tons being consumed in 1909 Illinois was the largest user of this fuel, consuming 83,988 tons, or 414 per cent of the total New York consumed 23,062 tons of anthracite coal, or 61 per cent of the total Ohio consumed 698 per cent of the gas reported for the industry -reported in 1909, 977 per cent were uprights Of their total value, that of the uprights represented -New York and Illinois were two the principal states in the manufacture of upright pianos at each of the three censuses covered by the table In 1909, the number reported for these two states combined (244,994) formed 67 per cent of the total for the United States In the manufacture of grand pianos, New York and Massachusetts were the two most important states, reporting in 1909, 6,831, or 781 per cent of the total number -Table 18 shows, by states, for 1909 the number and value of the upright pianos for or with player attachments and without player attachments, of grand pianos, and of player attachments made separate -Of the total number of upright pianos manufactured, 34,495, or 94 per cent, were for or with player attachments The value of the instruments for or with player attachments formed 167 per cent of the total value of upright pianos New York reported 18,917, or 548 per cent, of the upright pianos for or with player attachments -Production of organsTable 19 shows the number and value of the reed and the pipe organs reported for the United States and for seven of the leading states in the industry in 1909, 1904, and 1899 -1 A minus sign () denotes decrease 2 Included in all other states\" In 1909, of the total number of reed and of pipe organs reported, 19 per cent were pipe organs, but of the combined value 511 per cent was contributed by pipe organs In 1899, of the total number, only fivetenths of 1 per cent were pipe organs, while of the total value they contributed 226 per cent In the number of reed organs there was a decrease during the decade 18991909 of 399 per cent and in their value a decrease of 358 per cent For pipe organs there was an increase of 117 per cent in number and of -1305 per cent in value In the manufacture of reed organs Illinois was the leading state in 1909 as in 1899, reporting 375 per cent and 413 per cent, respectively, of the total value In the value of pipe organs manufactured Massachusetts, New York, and Illinois reported about equal amounts in 1909, Illinois showing much the largest gain from 1899 to 1909, while a decrease took place in -The principal data secured by the census inquiry concerning the manufacture of pianos and organs and materials, other than those relating to the number and value of specific classes of instruments, are presented by states in Tables 20 and 21 -the number of establishments, number of persons ~ngaged in the_ industry, primary

musical instrument industry are those engaged chiefly in the manuiacture of various kinds of musical instruments other than pianos and organs, or of materials for such instruments The mstruments made include cornets, trombones, tubas, and other brass instruments for band and orchestral use, cymbals, chums, xylophones, castanets, dulcimers, lrnrps, lyres, guitars, lutes, banjos, mandolins, zithers, violins, violoncellos, -flutes, flageolets, piccolos, etc, and parts of such instruments Separate totals as to the number and value of any of the several classes of instruments were not secured The industry is shown in Volumes VIII and IX of the Thfrteenth Census Reports under the designation \"Musical instruments and materials not specified\"  -t A minus sign () denotes decrease Where percentages are omitted comparable figures are not available -ï Comparable figures not available ï Figures not strictly comparable The value of products for this branch of the musical instrument industry does not show a very general increase from census to census The valuo in 1879 was -577 per cent less, and that in 1889 was 65 per cent less, than the value of products in 1869 The value in 1909 was 73 per cent less than that in 1904, and 49 per cent less than that in 1899 Dlliing the first half of the decade ending with 1909 there was considerable decrease in the number of establishments, accompanied by smaller decreases in the number of persons employed, capital invested, wages paid, and cost of materials, and an increase in the salaries, miscellaneous expenses, value of products, and value added by manufacture During the last half of the decade there was a decrease in all of the items except the number of establishments, number of salaried employees, and salaries -Table 23 gives more detailed statistics for the industry in the United States and for the different states as reported for 1909 New Jersey, Illinois, and Indiana, in the order named, were the leading states in the industry as measured by value of products, each of these states :reporting about onefilth of the total value of products for the United States, and the three together reporting 581 per cent of the total New York ranked fourth in value of products for the industry -The establishments assigned to this industry were engaged chiefly in the manufacture of phonographs or graphophones for either disk or cylinder records, including those for office dictation The classification also includes the manuf acturc of records, blanks, horns, needles, or other supplies and materials used in the industry -No statistics are given for the industry in census reports prior to 1889; at that census there were only two establishments reported, and therefore the data were not shown separately Each census since 1899 has shown an increase in the manufacture of phonographs and graphophones, but by far the greater development occurred dµring the fiveyear period 18991904, when there was an increase of 2,525, or -178 4 per cent, in the number of persons engaged in the industry, and of $7,990,801, or 3557 per cent, in the value of products While there was an increase of only 7 in the number of establishments during the decade, the number of persons engaged in the industry in 1909 was more than four times and the value of products more than five times as great as the corresponding :figures for 1899 In 1909, 16 of the 18 establishments were operated by corporations Table 25 gives in greater detail the statistics for the industry as reported for 1909 Pennsylvania is the only state for which the statistics could be given separately without disclosing the operations of individual establishments, and as Pennsylvania is not one -of the leading states in the industry, it has not been deemed worth while to present data in detail for this state The value of the products of the three establishments in Pennsylvania in 1909 was $134,659, or only 11 per cent of the total for the country New Jersey is by far the leading state in the industry, as measured by value of products, followed by Connecticut and New York in the order named -Of the total number of persons engaged in the industry, 5,199, or 877 per cent, were wage earners; 621, or 105 per cent, clerks, a class which includes other subordinate salaried employees; and 108, or 18 per cent, proprietors and officials Of the number of wage earners repolted on December 15, or the near_est representative day, 881 per cent were males and 119 per cent females The number of wage earners under 16 years of age represented but 11 per cent of the total January was the month of maximum and September that of minimum employment, the number shown for the latter month being equal to 676 per cent of the number for the former month -The total expenses reported for the phonograph and graphophone industry amounted to $9,388,735, of which 33 per cent represented the cost of materials, -303 per cent wages, 101 per cent salaries, and 267 per cent miscellaneous expenses \\x0cTHE PHONOGRAPH AND GRAPHOPHONE INDUSTRY -Table 26 shows the number of establishments that manufactured each kind of product for which separate

graphophones, some of which also made other products of the industry; 3 made records and blanks only; and 7 reported the manufacture of parts, supplies, etc -Table 27 shows for 1909 the number and value of such of the products as it is practicable to present without disclosing the operations of individual concerns -the value of $31,889 were manufactured in establishments engaged primarily in other industries On the other hand, a few of the 18 establishments in the industry \"phonographs and graphophones\" also manufactured other products, such as :fire extinguishers and electrical supplies -The records and blanks, parts, and supplies are frequently sold to establishments that manufacture the complete instruments In such cases the value of the parts and supplies ai∑e duplicated in the total value of products -At the censuses of 1904 and 1899 separate totals were shown only for the value of the completed instruments, records and blanks, and of all other products In Table 28 these values are placed in comparison with the totals for the same items reported in 1909 -The first special report on the manufacture of chemicals and allied products issued by the Bureau of the Census was that presented in connection with the reports of the census of manufactures for 1879 This report, like those for succeeding censuses, covered the operations of establishments engaged in the manufacture of acids, sodas, potashes, alums, glycerin, dyestuffs and tamung materials, explosives, fertilizers, pigmi;ints, wood distillation products, salts, and certain elementary substances, such as bromine and phosphorus, and in addition, embraced the statistics for establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of soap, candles, castor oil, glucose, and sulphur, which have not been included in the reports for subsequent censuses At the census of 1889, the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations and of paint and varnish were added to the group of industries covered by the special report, and at the census of 1899, the manufacture of essential oils and of bone, ivory, and lamp black were added, while the manufacture of pharmaceutical preparations was dropped from the group -Tables 1 and 2 of the present report cover practically the same ground as those for 1904 and 1899, containing statistics for nine separate industries, according to the classification employed by the Bureau of the Census, taken together, and for each individual industry separately, as follows: -The general chemical industry The manufacture of sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids Wood distillation The paint and varnish industry The fertilizer industry The manufacture of explosives The manufacture of dyestuffs and extracts The manufacture of essential oils The manufacture of bone, carbon, and lamp black -Comparison with earlier censuses for the group as a whole,Table 1 summarizes the statistics of the nine industries covered by this report for the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899 -Summary, by industriesTable 2 presents for 1909 a summary of the statistics of the several industries constituting the group as a whole -\"Chemicals\" was the leading branch in number of wage earners, reporting 337 per cent of the total for the combined chemical industry, followed by fertilizers\" and \"paint and varnish,\" with 26 per cent and 202 per cent, respectively Paint and varnish led in value of products with 294 per cent of the total for the industry as a whole, followed by chemicals and fertilizers with 277 per cent and 245 per cent, re-spectively In value added by manufacture, \"chemicals\" is first with 321 per cent of the total, fol)owed by \"paint and varnish\" and \"fertilizers,\" with 275 per cent and 206 per cent, respectively These three branches together reported 799 per cent of the average number of wage earners in the combined industry, -815 per cent of the value of products, and 802 per cent of the value added by manufacture \\x0cTHE GENERAL CHEMICAL INDUSTRY -Scope of the industry,The classification \"chemicals,\" as employed in the census statistics of manufactures, covers establishments engaged in the manufacture of a great variety of products, which may be grouped under the following heads: -I Acids, except sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids and such as are made by establishments in the wood distillation industry II Sodas III Potashes IV Alums V Coaltar products VI Cyanides VII Bleaching materials VIII Electrochemicals (substances produced by the aid of electricity, including metals and alloys produced by electrolytic or electrometallurgic processes) IX Plastics X Compressed or liquefied gases XI Fine chemicals XII Chemicals not otherwise specified The classification, however, does not cover the production of all substances coming under the head of chemicals in the ordinary acceptance of the term, as in many instances the manufacture of such products is included under some more distinctive industry classification Thus establishments engaged in the manufacture of sulphuric, nitric, or mixed acids as a primary product are included under the separate classification \"sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids\"; the production of alcohol by wood distillation is included under the classification \"wood distillation, not including turpentine and rosin\"; and the production of chemical substances for use as fertilizers is included under the classification \"fertilizers\" The manufacture of dyestuffs and extracts, explosives, essential oils, and paint and varnish may also properly be classed as chemical The statistics for the chemical industry, as defined by the Census Bureau, thus fall considerably short of constituting a complete presentation of the business of manufacturing chemical substances for sale, although it is probable that the classification covers the production of the great majority of the substances which are included under the term \"chemicals\" as popularly understood -The scope of the classification was the same in 1909 as in 1904; in 1899 and at prior censuses, however, the class:i:6cation included the manufacture of sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids and wood distillation, which were classified as independent industries at the censuses of 1909 and 1904 -Comparison with earlier censusesTable 1 summarizes the statistics of the chemical industry for each census from 1899 to 1909, inclusive -The statistics shown for 1899 in the table do not include those for the manufacture of sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids and the wood distillation industry, which were included under the general classifica-tion \"chemicals\" at that census and the figures for which are included with those for the chemical industry in some of the other tables of this report The value of products shown in the table conveys no precise idea of the magnitude or extent of the industry, since it involves considerable duplication due to the use of the products of some establishments in the industry as materials in other establishments, and also because it does not include the products of the kind embraced in the enumeration which are produced in establishments engaged primarily in manufacturing other products The number of establishments increased -1 A minus sign ( ) denotes decrease Where percentages are omitted, comï parable figures are not available,-ï

reported 30 per cent of the total value of products for the industry in 1909, New Jersey 194 per cent, Pennsylvania 136 per cent, and Michigan 11 per cent These four states together contributed nearly threefourths (74 per cent) of the total value of products and gave employment to 72 3 per cent of the average number of wage earners Ofthe states which reported products valued at $1,000,000 or over in 1909, Illinois shows the highest rate of increase in value of products from 1904 to 1909, 1039 per cent, followed by New Jersey, Ohio, and Massachusetts in the order named -Summary: 1909Table 4 shows, for 1909, the number of persons engaged in the industry, classified according to occupational status and sex, and in the case of wage earners, according to age also It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -In order to compare the distribution of the persons engaged in the industry in 1909 according to occupational status with that in 1904, it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (see Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 5 -Table 6 shows the average number of wage earners in the industry, distributed according to age, and in the case of tho8e 16 years of age and over,

hours of labor,In Table 8 the wage earners in the industry have been classified according to the hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or smaller number of hours -48 BeBeBe, tween tween tween 72and 48 54 54 60 60 and unand and and overder 54, 00 72 Over half (562 per cent) of the wage earners employed in the industry in 1909 were in establishments where the prevailing hours were 60 or more per week The largest single group shown in the table is that made up of the wage earners in establishments where the prevailing hours were between 54 and 60 per week, such wage earners constituting 388 per cent of the total number Between 54 and 60 hours per week was the most common working time reported in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York In Ohio and Pennsylvania the most common working time was 60 hours per week, in Illinois it was between 60 and 72 hours per week, and in Michigan it was 72 hours or over, while in Missouri it was between 48 and 54 hours per week -Table 9 presents statistics with respect to the character of ownership of the establishments in the industry in the United States -1909 for which figures can be shown without disclosproducts of these establishments represented 98 per cent -NOTEln some states, in order to avoid disclosing the returns for individual establishments, the figures for establishments under firm ownership have been consolidated with those for establishments under some other forms of ownership In such oases an (X) is placed in the

employed in establishments under corporate ownership; 206, or ninetenths of 1 per cent, in those under :firm ownership; and 233, or 1 per cent, in those owned by individuals Establishments operated by corporations were the most numerous class in every state for which figures are given in the table except Michigan, and in every state corporations reported all but an insignificant proportion of the value of products -Classification by value of produots,Table 11 presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for establishments grouped according to the value of their products -Classification by number of wage earnersTable 12 classifies the establishments in the 10 leading states according to the number of wage earners employed -The variations among the states in the proportions represented by the several classes of expenses (see Table 52) are due largely to diversity of products and to differences with respect to the amount of duplication in the cost of materials reported -Engines and power,Table 13 shows statistics of power used in the industry as reported at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899 The figures for 1899 include those for establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids, and in wood distillation As the total primary power reported for these industries in 1909 amounted to only -ii The total primary power used in the chemical inI dustry more than doubled during the decade In 1909, as in 1904 and 1899, power generated by steam engines was the most important form of power used in -the industry, although such power represented a much smaller proportion of the total primary power in 1909 than in 1899, thls decrease being due mainly to the great increase in the amount of rented electric power used The horsepower of electric motors used for distributing power by means of current generated in the establishment reporting shows a great increase for the decade -Table 14 shows, for 1909, the amount of each of the several kinds of power and of the different kinds of fuel used in the industry in eight of the leading states -Summary for the United StatesTable 15 shows statistics of the materials used in the industry for 1909, 1904, and 1899, only such specific materials being shown as were separately reported in 1909 In order to make the figures £or 1899 comparable with those for the other two censuses, the figures for establishments engaged in the manufacture of sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids, 11nd in wood distillation have been excluded from the figures for that year in all tables giving comparative statistics of materials and products -The relative increase in the cost of all materials for the decade 18991909 was 137 per cent Detailed information is available for but a few of the numerous materials consumed in the industry, and the cost of these represented less than onetwelfth (78 per cent) of the total cost of all materials in 1909 -Fuel consumedBituminous coal was the principal class of fuel used in the industry in 1909, Michigan reporting nearly onehalf of the total In New York and New Jersey antbmcite coal was chiefly used -in the manufacture of their :finished products was reported in the majority of cases, and is given in connection with the statistics as to products -Materials, by statesTable 16 gives, by states, statistics for the materials shown

classes of chemical products manufactured in 1909, 1904, and 1899 by establishments in the industry As previously noted, the figures for 1899 are exclusive of those -for establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids and in wood distillation The quantities and values of some of the products in this table do not agree with those in the Abstract of the Thirteenth Census and in Volume VIII, because it was found necessary to revise the :figures -The total value of products for the industry in 1909 amounted to $117,688,887, as compared with $48,039,595 in 1899, the increase for the decade being $69,649,292, or 145 per cent Each of the groups of products shown in the table contributed to the increase except potashes, which show a decrease The group showing the largest relative increase in value for the decade is that comprising chemical substances produced by the aid of electricity (Group VIII), the value of which was nearly fourteen times as great in 1909 as in 1899, the absolute increase amounting to $16,662,909 Compressed and liquefied gases (Group X) rank next in respect to relative increase in value during the decade, the value in 1909 being more than four times as great as in 1899 The value of plastics more than trebled during the decade, that of fine chemicals more than doubled, and that of acids was almost four times as great Sodas rank next to chemicals produced by the aid of electricity in amount of absolute increase in value for the decade ($9,821,067) -NoTE,For notes corresponding to the reference

however, not included, such establishments constituting a separate industry under the classification employed by the Bureau of the Census A considerable amount of these acids (chiefly sulphuric acid) was, however, produced by establishments engaged primarily in the chemical industry as defined by the Bureau of the Census, and this production is -included in T11ble 17 under the heading of \"Other acids,\" contributing the greater part of the value shown for this item The total production of sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids in all industries, so far as reported, is shown in the special report

washing soda, or crystalized sodium carbonate; bicarbonate of soda, including baking soda, saleratus, and sodium hydrogen carbonate; caustic soda, including soda lye and sodium -hydroxide; borax, including borax glass, lime and sodium borates, and sodium biborate; and other soda products, under which heading are included nitrate, sulphate, and sulphide of soda made by soda establishments, and in addition the products of compounders or packers who give an added value to soda lye or the carbonate -Table 25 shows statistics for all establishments manufacturing sodas for each census from 1889 to 1909, inclusive In order to make the statistics for 1909 comparable with those for earlier censuses, the figures are confined to the major soda products, viz, bicarbonate of soda, caustic soda, sal soda, and soda ash -Soda ash is the most important 0£ these products, both in quantity and value, while caustic soda ranks next There has been a steady growth since 1889 in the quantity and value of the sodas produced, the total tonnage 0£ these products in 1909 being more than :five times and the value more than three times that in 1889 Each class with the exception of caustic soda shows a considerable relative increase in quantity for the decade 18991909, the largest increase (654 per cent) being that £or soda ash -Group JIIPotashesPropedy speaking, the term \"potash\" includes only potassium carbonate in its various forms and degrees of purity The term has long been applied, however, to potassium hydroxide or caustic potash and this substance has been included with potassium carbonate in the statistics 0£ products given in this report The group \"potashes\" covers four products commercially distinguished, namely, (1) Potash or black salts, or black flux, which is the unrefined potassium carbonate produced by calcining stone ash, argols, or wine lees; (2) pearlash, or white flux, which is refined potassium carbonate; (3) stone ash, known also as crude potash or lump potash, which is a mixture of potassium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, and potassium sulphate with various organic and inorganic matter; and (4) potassium hydroxide, or caustic potash There :is included in Table 17 such of these potashes as were reported -Table 27 shows statistics 0£ all establishments manufacturing potashes for each census from 1849 to 1909, inclusive, such establishments being assigned to the chemical industry -The product shown in the table for 1909 includes the solid aJJd liquid potash produced electrolytically by one establishment in New York -Group IVAlumsThe group of alums comprises alum cake, or crude aluminum sulphate; concentrated alum, or crystalized aluminum sulphate; potash, ammonia, and soda alums and all other double sulphates of aluminum with alkali metals or their isomorphs, such as chrome alum; burnt alum; porous alum, which is effloresced soda alum in various degrees of purity; aluminoferric cake, or alum cake containing a considerable amount of iron; and aluminum hyclrate or hydroxide -The quantity of alums consumed in the establishments where produced was not reported in 1904, and it is probable that such alums were not in all cases reported for 1909 Table 29 shows the quantity and value of the several kinds of alum produced for sale in 1909, 1904, and 1899 -It seems probable that the statistics for the products shown separately in the table may not in all cases represent the total output of the specified product, as some establishments making these products may not have reported them separately but included them under \"other alums\" Some manufacturers, moreover, do not consider soda alum, which is known in the -trade as \"C T S,\" or cream of tartar substitute, as an alum, an~ hence may have reported it under Group XII (chermcals, not elsewhere specified) As the extent to which the different products were reported under other headings may have varied at different censuses, the figures for the different years may not be entirely comparable Of the products shown sepa~ rately in the table, concentrated alum was the most important in 1909, both in quantity and in value of output, alum cake coming next -Group VCoalt,a,r productsCoal tar is produced in the destructive distillation of bituminous coal, and is, therefore, a byproduct of the coalgas industry and of the coke industry when byproduct ovens are used The products obtained from it are reported under two heads: (1) The direct products of the distillation ?f coaltar sold a::i such, which include pitch, creosote 011, dead oil, and other tar oils, benzol (benzene), toluol, xylol, naphthalene, anthracene, and other coaltar hydrocarbons, phenol (carbolic acid), cresol, naphthol, -resorcin, or resorcinol, and other coaltar tertiary alcohols, and aniline, toluidine, xylidine, and other coaltar amines; and (2) chemicals made from coaltar distillery products, which include the aldehydes, acids, ketones, salts, and various other socalled benzene derivatives The latter cover the coaltar dyes, which are also produced by establishments assigned to the classification \"dyestuffs and extracts,\" and many nitrosubstitution compounds and synthetic preparations which are also made by establishments assigned to the classification \"oil, essential,\" and also a number of substances, such as are included under the heading of :fine chemicals\" in Table 17 Many establishments distilling coal tar consume part of the product in the manufacture of roofing felt, roofing paper, and roofing preparations or paints, and hence are classified as engaged in other industries On account of the great diversity existing in the kind and the value of the products, only the total value is given -The total value of coaltar products increased from $1,421,720 to $4,286,119, or 2015 per cent, during the decade Of the states shown separately in the table, Pennsylvania leads, followed by Ohio and Massachusetts New Jersey and Illinois, which are included under \"all other states,\" were also important states in the manufacture of coaltar products in 1909 The value of the coaltar products reported from New York shows a considerable decrease, amounting to 717 per cent for the :fiveyear period 19041909 Missouri also shows a decrease from 1904 to 1909 Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, on the other hand, show considerable increases -In 1909 the entire production was reported by establishments assigned to the chemical industry, as defined by the Bureau of the Census, but in 1904 cyanides to the value of $531,719, and in 1899 cyanides to the value of $10,582, were produced as secondary products by establishments in other industries, these amounts being included in the above table -Group VIIBleaching materialsThis group of products includes chlorine, chloride of lime (bleaching powder), chloride of soda and other hJpochlorites, hydrogen dioxide (peroxide), sodium, magnesium, calcium, barium, and other dioxides (peroxides), sulphur dioxide or sulphurous acid, sulphites, and sodium, potassium, calcium, and other bisulphites :Many of these substances are now manufactured by the aid of electricity, and the products made in this manner are included in Group VIII (chemicals produced by the aid of electricity) in Tables 17 and 19 -Table 36 gives statistics of the bleaching materials reported as made in 1909, 1904, and 1899 by all establishments, whether in the chemical industry or in other industries Bleaching materials manufactured by the aid of electricity are included -Hypochlorites constitute the most important class of bleaching materials manufactured, contributing -557 per cent of the total value of this class of products in 1909, while hydrogen peroxide ranks next Under \"other bleaching agents\" are included liquid chlorine, sulphur dioxide, sodium bisulphate, aluminum chloride, and other agents not specified There was a marked increase during the decade 18991909 in the manufacture of each class of bleachino materials, the output of hydrogen peroxide bein; nearly seventeen times as great in 1909 as in 1899, and that of bisulphites nearly eleven times as great Table 37 shows, by states, the total value of bleaching materials manufactured in 1909, 1904, and 1899 -ï In nd~ion, sulphur dioxide, valued at $4,667, was consumed in the establishment whore

twothirds of the value in 1904 and 1899 The value of the bleaching materials manufactured in New York, the greater part of which consists of hypochlorites made by the electrolytic process, was more than five times as great in 1909 as in 1899 -by value, is that comprising metals and alloys, which contributed 415 per cent of the total value of chemicals produced by the aid of electricity in 1909

includes the value of finished goods manufactured from plastics in the establishments producing the plastic material Table 42 shows the value of the production of plastics by establishments in all industries in 1909, 1904, and 1899 -The comparability of the returns for the different censuses may possibly be affected by variations in the extent to which manufactures of plastics were included; moreover, it is probable that some manufactured pyroxylin goods are included under other plastics\" The value of plastics, as reported, increased from $3,191,330 in 1899 to $7,472,732 in 1909, or

establishment where refined, which quantity exceeds that made for sale -Alkaloids are the most important class of fine chemicals shown separately, contributing 277 per cent of the total value in 1909, while acetone ranked next The production of alkaloids, however, decreased considerably during the fiveyear period 19041909, being less in 1909 than in 1899, although the value was nearly twice as great There was also a mar)rnd decrease in the production of platinum salts, but chloroform, ether, and acetone show striking increases in output The decrease in the average unit value of ether as reported, from 50 cents per pound in 1904 to 16 cents per pound in 1909, is chiefly due to the remission of the internalrevenue tax on alcohol used in chemical manufacture Ether is largely, if not wholly, made from alcohol and the tax of $110 per proof gallon is theoretically equal to 367 cents per pound of ether -The large proportion of the total value of this group of products included under the heading of \"all other suggests the possibility that a part of the output of some of the products shown specifically in the table -Group XIIChemicals, not elsewhere specijiedThls class embraces

shown separately in Table 48 Of the total production of glycerin shown in the table, which repre-sents the output of establishments manufacturing chemicals either as chief or as secondary products, a large part was produced as a secondary product in the manufacture of soap It was not manifest, in all cases, whether the product was refined or crude, and there is duplication in the figures representing the amount of the output to the extent that crude glycerin, the product of some establishments, was bought and refined by others, but the amount of this duplication can not be definitely ascertained -Table 49 presents, by states, detailed statistics as to the glycerin produced in 1909 The total production, including that reported as of no value at the works, is given in order to show the total available supply in the United States -($014) indicating that it was chiefly refined glycerin Although as stated the duplication due to the purchase of crude glycerin for refining can not be definitely determined, yet the quantity was considerable, amounting to at least 20,000,000 pounds Allowing for this duplication, the Jlroduction of marketable glycerin in 1909 (not including that used in the establishments where made) was approximately 60,000,000 pounds -New York was the leading state in the production of glycerin in 1909, reporting 309 per cent of the total output, while Ohio and Illinois ranked second and third, respectively, these three states together contributing 677 per cent of the total -Maryland, Ohio, and Georgia, in the order named were the leading states in respect to the manufactur; of Epsom salts Blue vitriol is chiefly a byproduct of copper refining, and all but a small part of the production was reported by establishments in the copper and lead smelting and

turpentine and rosin\" -Scope of the industry,The census classification \"bone, carbon, and lamp black covers establishments engaged primarily in the carbonization of bones in retorts, producing bone black; in the manufacture of carbon black by the burning of natural gas, the flame impinging upon slate or metallic slabs or revolving cylinders with a deposition of carbon; and in the production of lampblack by the imperfect combustion of coal and wood tar, petroleum, rosinj etc The industry also includes establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of ivory black, a pigment made by the carbonization of ivory scraps and waste At prior censuses the industry was known as \"bone, ivory, and lamp black\" -Comparison with earlier censuses,At the censUfl of 1849, 5 establishments were reported as engaged in the manufacture of bone, ivory, and lamp black, these establishments giving employment on the average to 24 hands and turning out products valued at $42,250 At the census of 1859, 24 establishments were reported, with an average of168 hands and products valued at $376,710; and at the census of 1869, 9 establishments were reported, employing on the average 56 hands and turning out product:l valued at $193,800 The variations from census to census may be clue to differences in the cla:lsification of individual establishments -1 A minus sign () denotes decrease, W hero percentages are omitted, comparable figures are not available, 2 Comparable figures not available, J<∑igures not strictly comparable -The statistics indicate that there was a general growth in the industry during each intercensal period covered by the table except the decade 18891899, for which period large decreases are shown The decreases for this decade are no doubt due in part to changes in classification whereby establishments included under the classification \"bone, ivory, and lamp black\" in 1889 were assigned to other industries in 1899 -407 per cent of the value of products, the value added by manufacture being $648,886 Persons engaged in the industryThe average number of persons engaged in the industry during 1909 -Wage earners employed, by monthsThe largest number of wage earners reported for any month of 1909 was 243, for October, and the smallest number, 215, equal to 885 per cent of the maximum, was reported for both February and March In 1904 the maximum number,

-Detailed state tableThe principal statistics secured for 1909 concerning the \"bone, carbon, and lamp black\" industry are presented in Table 4 -West Virginia ranked first among the states in the industry, as measured by value of products, in both 1909 and 1904, and Pennsylvania second, the prominence of these states in the industry resulting largely from their supply of natural gas, which is

valued at $596,058 in 1909, contributing 545 per cent of the total for the industry, as compared with products valued at $274,022, and representing 423 per cent of the total, in 1904 The increase in value of products for the industry as a whole during this fiveyear period amounted to 688 per cent, while for West Virginia alone, it amounted to 1175 per cent -Scope of the industryThe manufacture of dyestuffs and extracts used in the dyeing industry and that of extracts used in the tanning industry are so closely associated that since the census of 1879 the statistics for the two have been combined under the designation \"dyestuffs and extracts\" The class of dyestuffs comprises: (1) Natural dyestuffs, including logwood, fustic, quercitron, cochineal, lac dye, kermes, gambier, Persian berries, curcuma, Brazil wood, madder, cutch, and yellow oak bark, the ground and chipped wood, bark, or berries of these natural dyestuffs, and extracts such as logwood extract; (2) artificial dyestuffs, such as the aniline, phenol, azo, quinoline, and anthracene colors, including synthetic indigo, and the socalled coal tar dyes, special compositions or mixtures of dyes, and mineral dyes used in printing, such as chrome yellow, orange and green, iron buff or nankin yellow, prussian blue, ultramarine, and manganese brown; (3) mordants, such as myrobalans, valonia, dividivi, chestnut, nutgalls, oak and hemlock barks, the ground product and the extracts of these materials, and special mordanting liquors containing inorganic compounds; and (4) assistants, such as turkey ;red oil, iron liquor (black liquor, pyrolignite of iron), red liquor -The class of tanning materials includes the ground, chipped, or comminuted products of oak, chestnut, and hemlock wood or bark, palmetto roots, and sumac leaves; the fluid or solid extracts from these materials or from quebracho wood, quercitron bark, or other tannincontaining materials; tannic or gallic acid; and chrome tannage or other tannage solutions -The statistics pertain only to establishments producing dyestuffs or tanning materials for sale, and do not represent the entire manufacture of these products, as there is also a large production by establishments that use them in their own processes This is especially true of the various textile industries and is often true also in regard to the tanning industry -The :financial figures for 1869 are given in currency, which at that time was worth only about 80 cents, gold, to the dollar For strict comparison, therefore, these figures should be reduced about 20 per cent -1 A minus sign () denotes doorease Where percentages are omitted, comparalile figures are not available -ï Comparable figures not available  Figures not strictly comparable The value of products reported for 1909 was :five and a half times the value reported for 1869, part of this increase, however, being iattributable to the general advance in prices With the exception of the decade 18891899, in which decreases took place in most of the items included in the table, the industry has shown a substantial growth at each successive census -Summary, by states,Table 2 summarizes the more important statistics, by states, the states being arranged according to the value of products reported for 1909 The states shown in this table are given their actual ranking among all states, the rank of certain states for which data can not be presented being higher than that of some named in the table -cent of the average number of wage earners New in order, were the three leading states when ranked by -Jersey shows the largest relative increase in value of value of products, these states combined reporting -Wage earners employed, by monthsThe industry is not subject to any considerable seasonal variations The largest number of wage earners employed during any month in 1909 was 2,478, reported for August, and the smallest number 2,293, reported for January, the latter number being equal to 925 per cent of the maximum number In 1904 the maximum number of wage earners, 2,925, was reported for August, and the minimum, 2,340, for December, the latter number being equal to 80 per cent of the maximum -Prevailing hours of labor,The wage earners in the industry have been classified according to the hours of labor prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment is classified as a totai, according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though some of the employees may have worked a greater or less number of hours Of the 2,397 wage earners in the industry, 1,361, or 568 per cent of the total, were employed in establishments where the usual hours were 60 per week; 545, or 227 per cent, worked in establishments where less than 60 hours per week was the usual working time; and 491, or 205 per cent, were in establishments where the working time was over 60 hours per week -Size of establishmentsTable 5 presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for establishments grouped according to the value of their products -In some respects, and especially from the standpoint of conditions under which persons engaged in manufactures work, the best classification of establishments to bring out the feature of size is a classification according to the number of wage earners employed From this standpoint, the majority of the establishments engaged in the industry are comparatively small Of the 107 establishments in 1909, 3 employed no wage earners, 36 from 1 to 5 wage earners, 35 from 6 to 20, 20 from 21 to 50, 7 from 51 to 100, and 6 more than 100 wage earners No establishments employed over 250 wage earners -Expenses,As stated in the Introduction, the census figures for expenses do not purport to represent the total cost of manufacture, since they take no account of interest or depreciation, and consequently can not properly be used for determining profits Facts of interest can be brought out, however, concerning the relative importance of the different classes of expenses which were reported -Engines and powerAs shown by Table 11 the amount of primary power reported for this industry at the census of 1869 was 2,694, which had increased to 22,213 in 1909 Table 6 shows the number of engines or other motors, according to their character, employed in generating power (including electric motors operated by purchased current), and their total horsepower, as reported at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899 It also shows the number and horsepower of electric motors, including those operated by cu1Tent generated in the establishments reporting -Fuel consumedTable 7 shows the amount of each kind of fuel consumed in the industry in 1909 The amount expended for fuel and rent of power is shown, by states, in Table 10 -Materials and productsThe special schedule used in collecting the statistics from the manufacturers of dyestuffs and extracts called for the quantity and cost of acids (sulphuric, nitric, and mixed) and alcohol (grain and wood) consumed in this industry, the quantity and vah10 of the different products, and the quantity of certain products made and consumed in the establishments producing them -Table 8 gives the quantity and value of the chief products reported by the establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of dyestuffs and extracts in 1909, 1904, and 1899 ∑ -In addition to the products shown above, the products shown in the following table were made and used in further processes of manufacture in the establishments where produced -By far the most in1portant products, both in quan tity and value, in 1909, was oak and chestnut extracts There has been a very great increase in the quantity and value of these products since 1899 Other important increases are shown by artificial dyestuffs, iron liquors, sizes, and tannic acid, while considerable decreases are shown in the production of hemlock and logwood extracts, and of 6>1∑01md sumac -The report on Forest Products 1 for 1909 gives 386,817,895 pounds as the total consumption of tanning extracts in that year, which quantity exceeds the quantity of oak, chestnut, hemlock, and sumac extracts here reported by over 83,000,000 pounds This difference may be assumed to represent the tanning extracts imported or made and consumed in tanning establishments -1 Department of Commerce and Labor, Bureau of the Census, Forest Products of the United States, 1909 -Detailed statistics, by statesThe principal data secured by the census inquiry concerning the dyestuff and extract industry are presented, by states, in Table 11, which gives detailed statistics for 1909 concerning the number of establishments, the number -of persons engaged in the industry, the number of wage earners on December 15, or the nearest representative day, primary horsepower, capital, expenses, the total value of products, and the value added by manufacture -Scope of the industryThe statistics for the manufacture of explosives cover the operations of commercial establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of gunpowder and blasting powder, nitroglycerin, dynamite, guncotton, nitrosubstitution compounds and the explosives of which they are components, smokeless powder, and fulminates Statistics foi∑ governmental establishments are not included except as specially noted Establishments engaged primai∑ily in the manufacture of cartridges, detonators and fuses,

products reported for 1909 was more than nine times the value of products in 1869, the decade 18991909 showing the most rapid increase The decrease between 1904 and 1909 in the number of esfablishments shown is due to the fact that a larger number of individual plants operated under a common ownership were combined and reported as single establishments in 1909 than in 1904 In 1909 there were 54 plants, located in 14 states, which were reported as 16 establishments -Comparative summary, by statesTable 2 gives, for the three states which can be shown separately, the number of establishments, average number of wage earners, primary horsepower, capital, salaries, wages, cost of materials, value of products, and value addell by manufacture for 1909, 1904, and 1899 -The three states for which comparative statistics ure given show increases during the decade 18991909 in the more important items, such as average number of wage earners, value of products, and value added by manufacture -The presentation of statistics by states for the manufacture of explosives is unsatisfactory, because the totals for 11 number of states can not be shown without the possibility of disclosing the operations of individual establishments New Jersey, the most important state in the industry, and several other statesnotably California, Wisconsin, and Missouriare of more importance than some for which figures are given but are omitted from the table for the reason stated, while Colorado and Iowa were also of considerable importance -Persons engaged in the industryTable 3 shows, for 1909, the number of persons engaged in the industry, classified according t,o occupational status and sex and, in the case of wage earners, according to age It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -889 per cent, were wage earners; 242, or 34 per cent, were proprietors 11nd officials; and 542, or 77 per cent, were clerks, this class including other subordinate salaried employees Of the total number of persons engaged in the :industry, 6,787, or 962 per cent, were males and 271, or 38 per cent, females The average number of wage earners under 16 years age was only seven Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 4 gives the number of wage earners employed in the industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 The number of wage earners for the months of maximum and minimum employment are shown for several states in Table 13 -m1111mum being equal to 775 per cent of the maximum In 1904 the maximum number was reported for April, and the minimum number, reported for December, was equal to 957 per cent of the maximum -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 5 the wage earners in the industry have been classified according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or smaller number of hours -Character of ownershipTable 6 presents statistics with respect to the character of ownership of establishments in the explosive industry -In 1909, of the total number of establishments, 895 per cent were under corporate ownership, as compared with 879 per cent in 1904 The proportions for 1909 are affected by the inclusion of a number of reports in that year which covered more than one plant, whereas in 1904 separate reports wel∑e received for each plant The corporations reported 992 per cent of the value -ExpensesAs stated in the Introduction, the census figures ;representing expenses do not purport to show the total cost of manufacture, since they take no account of interest or depreciation; hence they can not propedy be used for determining profits Facts of interest can be brought out, however, concerning the relative importance of the different classes of expenses which were :reported Table l shows the total expenses in 1909 to have been $31,460,284, distributed as follows: Cost of materials, $22,811,548, or -The :figures in Table 9 relate only to materials purchased, and do not include acids or other materials produced in establishments where they were used in further processes of manufacture -In addition to the materials purchased by establishments manufacturing explosives as their chief product in 1909, statistics for which are given in Table -In comparing statistics in regard to materials for different years the fact should not be overlooked that in addition to the materials which are purchased certain materials are also made in the establishments that used them Table 10 shows the quantities of the most important materials which were manufactured in the establishments in which they were used in 1909 and 1904 The statistics given do not cover materials made and used in establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of products other than explosives or in establishments operated by the Federal Government -Recovered acid constitutes an important byproduct in the manufacture of explosives In 1909 the commercial establishments engaged primarily in the industry reported the recovery of 14,137,857 pounds of acid, valued at $62,935, and the establishments oper-The principal statistics secured by the census inquiry concerning the manufacture of explosives are presented, by states, in Table 13, which gives detailed figures for 1909 for number of establishments, -number of persons engaged in the industry, number of wage earners on December 15, or the nearest representative day, primary horsepower, capital, expenses, value of products, and value added by manufacture -Scope of industry,This classification covers establishments making artificial fertilizers, the products being ordinarily ready for use without being subjected to further treatment The production of certain kinds of products which are used more or less extensively for fertilizing without special manufacture is not covered by this report For example, the production of raw phosphate rock, including the process of grinding it, is treated as a mining industry, and, while part of the phosphate rock is used as material by fertilizer factories, a great deal of it is used directly as such on the farms Crude cottonseed, a farm product, is often used as a fertilizer without being subjected to any manufacturing process, and cottonseed meal and other products of cottonseedoil mills are also so used Tankage, which consists of various waste materials of slaughtering and meatpacking establishments, is also used to a considerable extent as a fertilizer without further preparation Much cottonseed meal and tankage, however, arc used as materials by the fertilizer factories included under the present classification -The raw materials used by fertilizer factories include animal, vegetable, and mineral products, while sulphuric and other acids are employed extensively in the treatment of the basic materials The finished prod∑ucts include a variety of classes, such as \"complete\" fertilizers, which consist of a mixture of super-phosphates with both potash and ammoniates, superphosphates with or without ammoniates, concentrated phosphates, and other minor classes -In addition to the production of fertilizers by establishments assigned to the present classiiication, there is a considerable production of similar finished fertilizers by concerns engaged primarily in the manufacture of other products, especially by slaughtering and meatpacking establishments and cottonseedoil mills In cases where the manufacture of fertilizers by concerns of this character was conducted as a separate department a separate report for this department was secured, and the statfatics are included with those for tho fertilizer industry, while in other cases separate reports were not secured, since the statistics of capital, labor, etc, for this branch of the business could not be segregated As a rule, however, tho quantity and value of the fertilizers produced and the quantity and cost of tho fertilizer materials used by such establishments were given, making it possible to present more complete statistics for these items -Summary and comparison with earlier censusesTable 1 summarizes the statistics for the fertilizer industry for each census from 1869 to 1909, inclusive The financial :figures for 1869 are given in currency, which at that time was worth only about 80 cents, gold, to the dollar

concentrated in the Southern states, the states of the South Atlantic division alone reporting more than half of the total value of products in 1909 In this connection it may be noted that, according to the census of agriculture, much the larger part of the expenditure of farmers for fertilizers is in the South In 1909 the farmers of the United States reported the expenditure of $114,882,541 for fertilizers, of which $75,752,296, or 659 per cent, was spent by the farmers of the South The farmers of the South Atlantic division alone spent $59,625,130, or more than half of the total Most of the expenditure for fertilizers outside of the South was reported from the three northeastern divisions of the countrythe New England, Middle Atlantic, and East North Central -Georgia is by far the most important state in the production of fertilizers, the value o:f its product in 1909 representing nearly onesixth of the total for the country Maryland ranks second among the states in value of products of the fertilizer industry Florida, one of the important states in this industry, shows the -greatest rate of increase in value of products between 1899 and 1909, 6756 per cent In Georgia the increase was 399 per cent, and in Virginia, Alabama, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Connecticut the rate of increase exceeded 100 per cent Although the percentage of increase during the decade was less conspicuous for South Carolina, this state advanced from sixth place in value of products in 1904 to third place in 1909 The increase shown for Illinois from 1904 to 1909 has little significance, as the :fertilizer business of certain establishments making :fertilizers as a subsidiary product was classed with the :fertilizer industry in 1899 and 1909 but not in 1904 rhe :figures for other states also may have been affected by changes in the method of reporting the manufacture of fertilizers by concerns primarily engaged in other industries -The following diagram shows graphically the value of products for the most important states in the industry in 1909 and 1899, while the map shows graphically the distribution, by states, of the value of products in 1909 -The average number of wage earners for each state in 1909, 1904, and 1899 is given in Table 19 The distribution of the average number by sex and age is not shown for the :individual states, but Table 20 gives such a distribution of the number of wage earners employed on the representative day No women were reported as wage earners in 12 of the 22 -states for which separate figures are shown The laTgest number of female wage earners, 47, wo,g reported for the state of Illinois, t1nd the next largest, 20, for Connecticut More than onehalf of the boys under 16 yeaTs of age were reported from Georgia -In order to compare the distribution of the persons engaged in the industry in 1909 according to occupational status with that in 1904 it is necessary to use the classi:fication employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 4 -Table 5 shows the average number of wage earners in the industry, distributed according to age, and in the case of those 16 years of age and over, according to sex, for 1909, 1904, and 1899 The number of women and children employed was so small that the increase from 1899 to 1909 has little significance -Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 6 give the number of wage earners employed in the industron the l~th (or the nearest representative day) of cac:_ month during the year 1909, for the 12 states in whici an average of 500 or more wage earners were employe1 during the year -534 per cent of the former In the more southen statesAlabama, Florida, Georgia, and South Caro linathe month of maximum employment was Febru ary or March and that of minimum employment July o: August, and there was no marked renewal of activit~ in the fall, but rather a general increase in numbe: employed from the month of minimum employmen1 to the end of the year In some of the other states however, there were periods of considerable activitJ both in the spring and in the late summer, and in Maryland, Ncw York, Ohio, and Virginia the maximum employment was in August or September The months of maximum and minimum employment in 1909, and the number of wage earneri: reported for these months, are given for a larger number of states in Table 21 -1 Tho month of maximum employment for each stuto ls indicated by boldface figures and that of minimum employment by italic figures -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 7 the wage earners in the industry have been classified according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total, according to the }lours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or smaller number of hours -More than ninetenths (934 per cent) of the wage earners employed in the industry in 1909 worked in establishments where the prevailing hours were 60 or more per week Less than 1 per cent were employed -in establishments where the usual hours were less than 54 per week In the industry as a whole, 14,502 wage earners, or 792 per cent of the total, were employed in establishments operating 60 hours per week, and this was the most common time of employment in every state for which data are shown in the table -Character of ownershipTable 8 presents statistics with respect to the character of ownershlp of the establishments in the fertilizer industry -Table 9 gives statistics for establishments classified according to form of ownership for the 12 states

should be borne in mind that because of the seasonal character of the industry, th~ average number of employees in any given establishment for the entire year is usually much less than the number employed during the busy months -ExpensesAs stated in the Introduction, the census does not purport to furnish :figures that can be used for deteri;nining the total cost of manufacture, since they take no account of interest or depreciation, and hence they can not properly be used for determining profits Facts 0£ interest can be brought out, however, concerning tho relative importance of the different classes of expenses which were reported -The largest amount of steam power, gasengine power, and rented electric power was reported for Georgia Rented electric power was reported for all the states listed, and formed more than onethird of the total primary power in Alabama, Georgia, and New York -Mateiials used by establishments in the fertilizer industryTable 14 shows the statistics of the materials used in the fertilizer industry for 1909, 1904, and 1899 -As judged by the amount expended for them, ammoniates, animal and vegetable, were in 1909 the most important materials, followed by phosphate rock, potash salts, superphosphates, nitrate of soda, ammonium sulphate, sulphuric acid, fish, pyrites, and kainit, in the order named -Of the total ql!lantity of sulphuric acid used in 1909 in the establishments engaged primalily in the manufactme of fertilizers, 582 per cent was manufactured in the establishments and 418 per cent was purchased Of the sulphuric acid made in fertilizer works, 846 per cent was used and 154 per cent was sold -All fertilizer establishments manufacturing su1phuric acid employed the chamber process, 16 using the Hoffman intensifier system, 11 the Pratt, 9 the Gilchrist, 3 the Meyer tangential system, and 1 the Luney The manufacture, for consumption in their own works, of 1,826,358 tons of acid phosphate was reported by establishments engaged primarily in the fertilizer industry, and 12,507 tons were made and consumed by establishments manufacturing fertilizers as a subsidiary product -Materials used by all establishments making fertilizersThe data in Tables 14 and 15 relate to the materials reported by the establishments manufacturing fertilizers as their chief product Thele is a considerable consumption of these materials by establishments in other industries which make fertilizers as a subsidiary product Table 16 shows the total consumption of these materials in 1909 by all establishments manufacturing fertilizers, whether as a primary or subsidiary product -It should be noted in considering these statistics that the superphosphates purchased for use as material rem∑esent a duplication, the value of such superphosphates being reported as part of the value of product of other establishments in the industry, and the same may be true to some extent of sulphmic acid purchased In 1909 there were purchased and used aE! material 532,886 tons of superphosphates, costing, $5,175,157 (see Table 16), which leaves 5,095,348 tons, valued at $94,914,814, for the net production of fer tilizers by all

engaged primarily in their manufactllle, for the leading states -In Table 2 the states are ranked according to the total value of products in 1909, the leading states being Georgia, Maryland, South Carolina, Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Alabama, in the order named The three states first named had the same -rank according to tonnage of fertilizers produced, but Alabama ranked fourth in this respect, ahead of Virginia, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania Georgia ranked first in 1909 in the production of complete fertilizers, ammoniated fertilizers, and superphosphates, fifth in concentrated phosphates, and second in the group of\" other\" fertilizers, while Maryland was second in complete fertilizers and superphosphates, third in ammoniated fertilizers, fourth in concentrated phosphates, and first in the group of \"other\" fertilizers In ammoniated fertilizers and concentrated phosphates Alabama ranked second New York ranked first in tho production of concentrated phosph11tes -The

peppermint, wintergreen, blackbirch, and Rpearmint oils The statistics for the production of essential oils by establishments engaged primarily in tho manufacture of products other than essential oils (chemicals, flavoring extracts, etc) are not included in this report except as specially noted -Summary and comparisons with earlier censusesStatistics for tho essentialoil industry were fust obtained at tho census of 1859 At this census 45 establishments, giving employment to 74 hands, were reported, the value of their products amounting to $124,317 -Table 1 summarizes the statistics for the manufacture of essential oils for each census from 1869 to 1909, inclusive The financial figures for 1869 are given in currency, which at that time was worth only about 80 cents, gold, to tho dollar For strict comparison, therefore, these figures should be reduced about 20 per cent -1 A minus sign() denotes decrease, Where percentage~ are omitted, comparable figures are not avai!ahle -ï Comparable figures not availablo Figures not strictly comparable The number of establishments in this industry shows a considerable decrease between 1879 and 1899, but has increased somewhat since that date The very considerable decrease in value of products shown for tho period 18691879, even after making allowance for the fact that the figures for 1869 were reported in a depreciated currency, taken in connection with the even greater increase from 1859 to 1869, makes it seem probable that at the census of 1869 the production of essential oils on farms was included in the manufactures

classified according to occupational status and sex, and in the case of wage earners, according to age also It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -The average number of persons engaged in the industry during 1909 was 408, of whom 290, or 711 per cent, were wage earners; 91, or 223 per cent, proprietors and officials; and 27, or 66 per cent, clerks, the latter class including other subordinate salaried employees Of the total number engaged in

classes of expenses which were reported rable 1 shows the total expenses in 1909 to have been $1,522,171, distributed as follows: Cost of materials, $1,255,478, or 825 per cent; wages, $122,990, or 81 per cent; salaries, $61,505, or 4 per cent; and miscellaneous expenses, made up of advertising, ordinary repairs of buildings and machinery, insurance, traveling expenses, and other sundry expenses, $82,198, or 54 per cent These proportions vary somewhat in the several states, largely by reason of differences in the character of the products -Engines and powerOf the 68 establishments in the

primarily in the manufacture of sulphuric acid, nitric acid, and mixed acids (the latter being mixtures of sulphuric and nitric acids in various proportions) was first made at the census of 1904 At prior censuses such establishments were included under the classification \"chemicals\"; the returns for 1899, however, were so recorded that it has been possible to separate the statistics for establishments manufacturing these products from those engaged primarily in the manufacture of other acids and chemicals, so that the totals for that census may be placed in comparison with those for 1909 and 1904 Although the statistics here presented pertain to establishments manufacturing sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids as chief products, additional statistics are given in certain of the tables showing the total production of these acids by all establishments, including those engaged primarily in the manufacture of fertilizers and explosives and those refining petroleum -In comparing the figures in Table 1 for different censuses, it should be borne in mind that large quantities of sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids are used in the manufacture of fertilizers and explosives and in other industries, and that variations from census to census in the relative extent to which the establishments in these industries manufacture the acids whlch they use as materials affect the figures for the establishments engaged in the manufacture of these acids as primary products -During the decade 18991909 the value of products increased 15 per cent, but the average number of wage earners and value added by manufacture decreased 44 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively, all of the decrease in the former item taking place during the second half of the decade, and all of that in the latter item taking place in the first half of the decade -Summary, by statesTable 2 gives in detail the principal statistics of the manufacture of sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids, by states, for 1909 -New

increase of 83 per cent for the decade as a whole, all of which took place during the :fiveyear period 19041909, while its cost shows a decrease of 121 per -cent, the average cost per ton in 1909 being considerably less than that in 1904 or 1899 The quantity of pyrites used, on the other hand, increased 876 per cent and the cost increosed 1212 per cent during the decade, practically all of these increases taking place between 1904 and 1909 There was a decrease of 73 per cent during the decade in the quantity of nitrate of soda used; its cost, however, increased 258 per cent -Since a very large proportion of the total amount of sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids manufactured is made by establishments in other industries, either as secondary products or for their own use in further processes of manufacture, the quantity and value of the sulphur, pyrites, and nitrate of soda used by such establishments are shown in Table 9, which also gives the quantity and value of these materials used by establishments in the industry, together with the combined total reported for all establishments making these acids -1 Not includiu~ those used by 13 establishrnonts manufacturing

establishments reported the manufacture of sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids These establishments include 13 engaged in the manufacture of explosives, for which separate figures as to the materials used in the manufacture of acids are not available, and 5 which reported the utilization of sulphur fumes from the roasting or smelting of copper and zinc sulphide ores The quantity of ore used by these latter establishments was not fully reported, but was approximately 275,000 tons, and is not included with the pyrites above reported The sulphur fumes are considered a waste product, and no cost was assigned to them -mixed acids include 94 fertilizer factories manufacturing sulphuric acid for their own use, which reported 4,236 tons of sulphur and 456,574 tons of pyrites, or nearly

output of sulphuric acid sold as such increased 888 per cent on the basis of 50∞ Baume acid, and that of mixed acids 72 per cent, while the production of nitric acid sold as such shows a decrease of 588 per cent, all of which, however, took place between 1904 and 1909 The value of \"all other products\" includes the value of pyrite cinder and niter cake sold Table 12 gives the statistics for these waste products for 1909 -PYRITE CINDER AND NITER CAKE REï PORTED BY ESTABLISHMENTS MANU∑ FACTUR1NG SULPHURIC, NITRIC1 AND MIXED ACIDS -In 1909, 601,024 tons of pyrite cinder and 43,301 tons of

addition to the production shown in Table 11, sulphuric, nitric, and miiced acids to the value of $5,7351370 in 1909 and $5,195,433 in 1904 were made for sale by establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of other chemicals and of fertilizers and in other industries rable 13 gives the aggregate production of these acids for sale both by the establishments in the sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acid industry and by those in other industries during 1909 and 1904 -It will be noted that of the total value of sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids produced for sale in 1900, less than threefilths (569 per cent) was reported by establishments manufacturing these acids as primary -products, the proportion in 1904 being about the same The percentages of the total production reported by such establishments in 1909 vary considerably in the case of the different acids, ranging from 793 for mixed acids to 307 for nitric acid -In addition to the sulphuric acid made for sale, large quantities are made for use in further processes of manufacture by establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of other chemicals, fertilizers, and explosives, and in the refining of petroleum Table 14 presents statistics as to the total production of sulphuric acid, by grades, in 1909, 1904, and 1899, including that consumed in the establishment where produced -Approxinmtely onehalf of the total amount of sulphuric acid made is used in the establishments manufacturing it, the proportion of the total quantity on the basis of 50∞ acid being 463 per cent in 1909, 518 per cent in 1904, and 494 per cent in 1899 The bulk of the acid used in the establishment where produced is 50∞ Baume, or chamber acid The chamber process is in most general use The use of the contact process -was reported by 17 establishments The weight of the platinum used in the contact masa was not in all cases reported, but the quantitiea reported ranged from !l minimum of 257 ounces to a maximum of 1,587 ounces It

included in this industry, nor establishments making spirits of turpentine from the crude turpentine or gum exuded by the southern pine, these establishments constituting, respectively, the charcoal industry and the turpentine and rosin industry as defined by the Census Bureau -The statistics cover several establishments which purchase crude wood alcohol as their raw material and by further processes of manufacture turn it into the refiped product This results in a certain amount of duplication in the returns, 7,135,614 gallons of crude alcohol, valued at $1,784,029, having been purchased in 1909 by these refining establishments It is fair to assume that most of this alcohol was produced by other establishments in the industry and was included  among the products reported by them -Comparison with earlier censusesThe returns for 1899 were made in such a way that separate totals for the industry can be presented for that census, but the returns for prior censuses can not

report on Forest Products of the United differ somewhat from those given in Table 10 of report The primary object of that portion of inquiry relative to forest products which relates wood distillation was to ascertain the quantity of woods and of softwoods consumed in these Pr<)cesses and the statistics cover only the establishments use wood as their raw material, whereas the inquiry upon which the present report is mainly covered both the establishments that made the alcohol from wood and those which were engaged wholly in refining crude alcohol The statistics in, Table 10, £or instance, show the final output of the establishments during the year, both of crude alcohol and of refined alcohol, while the statistics in the report on forest products cover the 1Jroduction of crude alcohol only The final product of most of the establishments included in the census reports is crude wood alcohol~ which is disposed of to other establishments engaged: solely in the refining process In addition,

manufactured in thewood distillation industry in 1909 -Detailed state tableThe principal data secured by the census inquiry concerning the industry are presented, by states, in Table 14, which gives detailed statistics for 1909 concerning the number of pers6ns -engaged in the industry, primary horsepower, wage earners on December 15, or the nearest representative day, capital, expenses, value of products, and the value added by manufacture -Summary and comparison with earlier censusesThe statistics presented in this report are for establishments engaged in the manufacture of \"oven coke\" They do not cover those making ordinary gashouse coke, which is obtained as a byproduct in the manufactule of illuminating gas Although oven coke was manufactured in the United States for some years -prior to 1849, the census of that year was the first at which statistics for the industry were shown, but the census of 1879 was the first to include statistics for the industry that are comparable with those for more recent censuses Table 1 summarizes the statistics of the industry for each census from 1879 to 1909, inclusive -1 A minus sign() denotes decrease Where percentages are omitted comparable figures are not available -ï Comparable figures not available ï Figures not strictly comparable ï Includes 415,472 tons of coke in 1909 and 410,225 tons in 1904 produced by establislunents engaged primarily In the manufacture of products other than coke, the value of which is not included in tile value of products shown in this table Most of the coke ovens are operated in connection with coal mines, but the statistics given in this report relate only to the manufacture of coke If separate accounts were not kept for the two branches of industry, as was the case in a few instances, estimates were secured for the items pertaining to the production of coke, including an estimate of the quantity and value of the coal used -Coke is made in beehive ovens and in byproduct ovens or retorts Where beehive ovens are used the cost of materialschiefly bituminous coalconstitutes a rather large proportion of the total value of products, the process of manufacture itself being relatively simple and inexpensive, but the processes in the manufacture of coke in byproduct ovens or retorts are complex, and the apparatus and operation costly The total cost of the materials used in the manufacture of coke in 1909 was $64,024,527, which was equal to twothirds (669 per cent) of the total value of products, while the value added by manufacture (that is, the value of products less the cost of materials) was $31,672,095 -542 per cent, and the amount paid in wages 661 per cent The quantity of coke produced increased 19,674,267 short tons, or 1002 per cent, during the decade 18991909 Summary, by statesTab]e 2 summarizes the more important statistics by states, the states being arranged according to value of products in 1909 Certain states for which data can not be shown separately ranked higher than some of those named in the table -The production of coke was reported for 21 states in 1909; the data for but 6 states can be shown separately, however, without disclosing the operations of individual concerns Pennsylvania is by far the most important state in the manufacture of coke, reporting -541 per cent of the total value of products in 1909 The number of wage earners employed in the industry in Pennsylvania increased 652 per cent during the decade ending with 1909, and the value of products 1325 per cent Alabama ranked second in 1909 in value of products West Virginia, although ranking third in value of products, was second in number of wage earners employed and in value added by manufacture Of the states for which percentages are shown in the table, Ohio shows the forgest percentage of gain during the decade 18991909 both in number of wage earners and in value of products, but in value added by manufacture Alabama shows the largest increase135 per cent -Persons engaged in the industryTable 3 shows, for 1909, the number of persons engaged in the manufacture of coke classified according to occupational status and sex and, in the

day) of each month during the year 1909, for the :five states in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed during the year, for which :figures can be shown separately -Dece1:1~er, and the smallest number 26,461, in April, the mnumum number being equal to 80 per cent of the maximum The industry is not subject to any great seasonal variation, but is considerably affected by fluctuations in the iron and steel industry In 1904 the maximum number of wage earners, 21,420, was reported for December, and the minimum number, 16,893, for July, the minimum being equal to 789 per cent of the maximum -1 The month of maximum employment for each state is indicated by boldface figures and that of minimum employment by italic figures -The months of maximum and minimum employment for 1909 and the number of wage earners reported for these months are given in Table 20 for all states for which separate statistics can be shown -Prevailing hours of labor,In Table 7 the wage earners in the coke industry have been classified according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment is classified as a total according to the prevailing hours in the establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or a smaller number of hours -More than threefifths (643 per cent) of the wage earners engaged in tho manufacture of coke in 1909 were in establishments where the prevailing number of hours was 60 or more per week Only 8 per cent were employed in establishments where the prevailing hours were less than 54 per week Wage earners in establishments where the prevailing hours were 60 per week constituted 397 per cent of the total number This group was the most important in Virginia and West Virginia, and in Colorado it comprised all -the wage earners reported, but in Pennsylvania the wage earners in establishments where the prevailing hours per week were 54 formed the largest group A considerable number of wage earners in this state, however, were in establishments which reported 48 hours a week or less, 60 hours a week, and 72 hours or over, respectively, as the prevailing hours of labor, -298 per cent of the total number of wage earners being reported in the 60hour group In Alabama the greatest number of wage earners, 39 per cent of the total, were employed in establishments which reported more than 60 but less than 72 hours per week as the prevailing hours of labor Character of ownershipTable 8 presents statistics with respect to the chan1cter of ownership of the coke establishments in the United States -1 Includes one establishment under cooperative ownership, to avoid discloBUre of individual operations -In 1909, of the total number of pfants reported, 876 per cent were under corporate ownership, as compared with 892 per cent in 1904 The value of products of these establishments (including the one establishment under cooperative ownership in 1909) represented -954 per cent of the total value of products in 1909 and 937 per cent in 1904 Table 9 gives statistics

individual ownership were all reported from Pennsylvania, and of the 17 operated by firms, 15 were reported from that state and 1 each from Virginia and West Virginia -Size of establishmentTable 10 presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for coke establishments grouped according to the value of their products -In 1909, 54 per cent of the coke establishments manufactured products valued at $1,000,000 or over, as against 18 per cent in 1904 While such establishments represented only a comparatively small proportion of the total number at both censuses, they reported 531 per cent of the total value of products in 1909 and 384 per cent in 1904 The increase in the importance of thls class of establishments during the fiveyear period was in part, but by no means -ExpensesAs stated in the Introduction, the census figures for expenses do not purport to represent the total cost of manufacture, since they take no account of interest or depreciation; hence they can not prop∑ erly be used for determining profits Facts of interï est can be brought out, however, concerning the rela∑ tive importance of the different classes of expenses which were reported Table 1 shows the total expenses for the coke industry in 1909 to have been $84,839,24~, distributed as follows: Cost of materials, $64,024,5211 -Table 13 presents statistics for 1909 with regard to power and fuel used in the coke industry in four of the leading states -In 1909 Pennsylvania ranked first with respect to the amount of power used, reporting 26,091 horsepower, or 417 per cent of the aggregate for the industry Steam was the most important form of power in all of the states shown, with the exception of Virginia, where electric power was most largely used -manufacture of coke in 1909 These figures, however, do not include 566,539 tons used in establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of products other than coke The difference between this total and that shown in Table 14 as charged into the ovens, amounting to 241,607 tons, may be considered as the amount of coal used for fuel in heating boilers, retorts, etc -Materials used, for the United States as a wholeTable 14 shows, for 1909, 1904, and 1899, the quantity and cost of the coal used in the ma:nuf acture of coke, including the small amount so used in establishments not assigned to the coke industry The quantity of coal used in the manufacture of coke is, to a considerable extent, a matter of estimate, as a large proportion of the coal is charged directly into the ovens from the mines without being weighed or measured; in fact, -there are as yet comparatively few establishments in this country where the quantity of coal made into coke is accurately ascertained Where mining and the manuf actm∑e of coke were conducted by the same concern, and separate accounts were not kept, the companies were required to estimate the quantity and value of coal used for coking purposes In order to avoid a duplicate canvass the United States Geological Survey, which annually collects statistics -of the production of coke, and the Bm:eau of the Census cooperated il1 collecth1g data for the year 1909 The figures for coal used and coke produced are the same, therefore, in the reports of the two bureaus for 1909 The variations in the reports for other census years ;may be attributed to differences in tho methods e:mployed by the two bureaus -Products, for the United States as a wholeTable 15 shows the quantity and value of the products of the coke ovens for 1909, 1904, and 1899, the figures including the products of ovens operated by establishments assigned to othel industries, as well as of those operated by establishments in the coke mdustry proper The figures do not, however, include the products of establish,ments in the illuminating gas industry, which make coke and various byproducts mcidentally to the manufactUJ:e of gas In comparing the values of coke shown in the table with the quantities, it should be borne in mind that a great many cokemanufacturing concerns are controlled by large iron and steel companies and that the prices fixed for the coke may in some such cases be on an arbitrary basis ;not confor:ming to market prices Moreover, while the schedule called for the selling value of the product at the works, it was not always possible to obtain this value, and in some instances the a:mount received at the place of delivery was reported -The total quantity of oven coke reported for 1909, 39,315,065 short tons, represents an increase of 19,674,267 tons, or 1002 per cent, over the amount reported in 1899 An average of practically one and onehalf tons of coal was used per ton of coke produced in each of the three census years By reason of the increased use of

amount of coal used, the coke produced, and its value, for 1909, 1904, and 1899 The figures include the data for coke manufactured by establislunents engaged primarily in other industries (except the -In the United States as a whole the yield of coke in 1909 was equal in weight to 662 per cent of the coal consumed, as compared with 673 per cent in 1904 and -651 per cent in 1899 The changes from census to census in the yield of coke are affected by changes in the relative importance of the different kinds of coal used The high grade of coal used for coke in Pennsylvania is indicated by the fact that the yield in that state (673 per cent) in 1909 was higher than in any other state for which figures are shown separately, although not so high as that shown for \"all other states\" Ohio shows a marked increase in the yield of coke from coal during the decade, the percentage being 588 in 1899 and 654 in 1909 In Alabama, Virginia, and West Virginia, the yield in 1909 was higher than in 1899, but in Pennsylvania and Tem1essee it was lower in 1909 than in either of the two preceding census years COKE PRODUCED,!-The average value of coke for the United States as a whole increased from $176 per short ton in 1899 to $229 in 1909; and in each state there was an increase in the average during the decade and during each of the fiveyear periods, except that in Virginia and Ohio the average was lower in 1904 than in 1899 There is a -Table 17 presents, for the United States as a whole statistics with respect to the number of coke oven~ in 1909, 1904, and 1899, and Table 18 shows, for the United States as a whole and for individual states, the number of beehive ovens and of other styles of ovens respectively, for each year  -Notwithstanding the much larger capacity of the byproduct ovens, this type showed a greater percentage of increase in number from 1899 to 1909 than the beehive type The latter type increased from 46 345 -248 per cent, respectively, in 1904 No beehive ovens were reported from Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, 11innesota, New Jersey, or New York at either census, while the beehive type only was used in 1909 in 12 of the 26 states reporting coke as a product Colorado, which reported 42 byproduct ovens in 1904 and none in 1909, is the only state in which their use has been discontinued -Scope of the industryThe census classification \"gas, illuminating and heating\" covers establishments making gas for sale for light, heat, or power, including some estrtblishments operated by municipal governments It covers the production of gas by various processes, including the destructive distillation of coal, wood, resins, oils, or other carbonaceous substances; the action of steam upon incandescent carbon or carboncontaining substances; the volatilization, or cracking, of petroleum or the petroleum distillates; and the action of water upon substances like calcium carbide -The production of gas for the exclusive consumption of the same concern is not covered Many residences, hotels, and mercantile establishments have plants for making acetylene or other gas for heat, light, or power, and many manufacturing and other industrial concerns make gasusually \"producer\" gasin large quantities for use as fuel in their own establishments The increased use of gas engines for generating power has led to a marked development in such production of gas by establishments for their own consumption -The gas produced in byproduct coke plants, also, except a comparatively small proportion which is sold to gas companies and by them in turn sold to their customers, does not figme in this report The quantity manufactured by this process is given in Table 15 Blast furnace gas also is not covered by the statistics -and appliancesholders, mains, service pipes, meters, cylinders, etcsuch as in other cases would be owned by the gas manufacturers Fiftyone such establishments were reported in 1909 The total capital of these establishments was $15,297,324; the quantity of gas sold by them was 3,273,618,000 cubic feet, having a value of $3,605,635; and their receipts from rents and sales of lamps and appliances totaled $19,843, and from all other products $38,719 In general, however, the concerns covered by the tables distribute the gas which they manufacture directly to the consumer, and a large part of their capital and expenses is connected with the process of distribution -Establishments in the industry produce not only straight coal gas, straight water gas, carbureted water gas, mixed coal and water gas, oil gas, and acetylene gas, but also as byproducts tar, pitch, benzol, hydrocarbons, ammonia water, ammonium sulphate, coke, cyanides, and other p1∑oclucts -Statistics of this industry were secured at the census of 1849, and at each subsequent census except that of 1879 In 1889 it was for the :first time made the subject of a special report, which was purely statistical A second special report was made at the census of 1899 which embraced, besides a presentation and discussion of the statistics which had been collected, a history and description of the industry -, A r{iinus sign () denotes decrease Where percentages are omitted comparable figures aro not ava a e, a Comparable figures not av~ilable -371 It should be borne in mind that in most cases this value represents that of the product delivered to the consumer, and that, as already stated, a considerable part of the expenses of the industry are connected with distribution It is partly for this reason that the cost of materials constitutes a relatively smaller proportion of the total value of products in this industry than in most others In 1909 the materials cost $52,427,844, which is equal to 314 per cent of the value of products, while the value added by manufacture was $114,386,527 While the census statistics of capital are by no means reliable, there can be no doubt that the amount of capital invested is much higher in proportion to value of products in the illuminatinggas industry than in most others, chiefly because of the fact that the investment includes the cost of mains and other distributing apparatus by which the product is delivered to the consumer, often at a very considerable distance -Summary, by statesTablo 2 summarizes the more important statistics by states, the states

rank in some items than some of the states for which separate :figures are given -The industry is well distributed throughout the United States, some establishments being reported for every state New York is the most important state in the manufacture of gas; in 1909 it reported 254 per cent of the total value of products Illinois, which ranked second, reported about oneeighth of the total value of products, but reported nen,rly as many wage earners as New York Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New Jersey were third, fourth, and fifth in rank in 1909 with respect to wage earners, value of products, and value added by manufacture Together, these five leading states reported 539 per cent of the wage earners in the industry, 60 per cent of the value of products, and 596 per cent of the value added by manufacture -Most of the states held the same, or practically the same, rank in respect to value added by manufacture in 1909 as in respect to value of products Colorado was the most conspicuous exception, ranking twen-Remarkable increases in value of products between 1899 and 1909 are shown for the following states: Michigan, 3581 per cent; Washington, 4329 per cent; Texas, 3326 per cent; and Ore,gon, 4194 per cent On the other hand, conspicuous decreases occurred during the decade in Ohio and Kansas, presumably because of the substitution of natural for manufactured gas -A few of the less important states advanced notably in rank in this industry, as measured by value of products, from 1904 to 1909Washington, from twentysixth place to eighteenth place; Texas, from twentyfifth to nineteenth; Utah, from thirtyseventh to thirtythird; Vermont, from fortieth to thirtysixth; and Mississippi, from fortyfirst to thirtyeighth Ohio dropped from eighth place in 1904 to thirteenth in 1909; Minnesota, from twelfth to fifteenth; Georgia, from eighteenth to twentysecond; Kentucky, from twentieth to twentysixth; Arkansas, from thirtyfourth to thirtyninth; Kansas, from twentyseventh to fortieth; and West Virginia, from thirtyeighth to fortyfirst -The diagram below shows graphically the value of products reported for the most important states in the industry in 1909

that the sex and age ?lass~fication of the average number of wage earners 1ll this and other tables is an estimate  The average number of persons engaged in the gas mdustry during 1909 was 51,007, of whom 37,215, or -a comparatively small number of wage earners, much the larger number, together with most of the clerks, being employed in the distribution service -The average number of wage earners in each state for the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899 is given in Table 21 The distribution of the average number by sex and age is not shown for the individual states, but Table 22 gives such a distribution for 1909 for the -number employed on December 15, or the nearest representative day In order to compare the distribution of persons -engaged in the industry according to occupational status in 1909 with that in 1904, it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 4 Comparable :figures for 1899 are not avnilable The table shows that salaried employees increased about twice as rapidly as wage earners -Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 6 gives the number of wage enrnors employed on the 15th (or the nearest ropresentn,tive day) of each month during the year 1909 for the 15 states in which 500 or more wage earners were employed during the year The District of Columbia, in which an average of more than 500 wage earners wore employed in the gas industry in 1909, is omitted from the table, as its incluï sion would disclose individual operations -In the United St1ites as it wholo the largest number of wage ea,rners reported for any month of 1909 was 40,412, in Juno, 1tnd tho smttllost number 32,562, in February, the minimum number being equal to 806 per cent of the maximum In 1904 the maximum number of wage earners, 32,449, was reported in July and the minimum, 28,115, forming 866 per cent of the maximum, in February Although more gas is usuï ally consumed in winter than in summer, most of the work connected with the distributing system is outdoor work and subject to seasonal and weather conditions; therefore the maximum of employment for outside workers, and also for all wage earners comï binecl, occurs during the summer months, when the works and mains are put in repair and extended, and tho minimum during the winter, when such work, in a large measure, is impracticable -No:mThe month of maximum employment for each state is shown by boldface figures and that of minimum employment by italic figures -The months of maximum and mmrmum employment for 1909, and the number of wage earners reported for these months, are given for 46 states in -Table 22 Prevailing hours of laborSatisfactory statistics reoarding the prevailing hours of labor in estB,blishm:nts manufacturing gas can not be presented While in most industries the great majority of the wage earners iri any given establishment work for the same number of hours weeldy, this is by no means generally true in the gas industry The census schedule did not call for the number of wage earners working a specified number of hours, but called only for the hours generally prevailing in the establishment The employees known as \"gasrnen\" or \"ga~ mU,kers\"that is, those who work in the manufacturing branch of the businesswork more homs per week than the yard and street men, who work in connection with the distributing branch of the business, and who usually form a larger proportion of the total number of wage earners than the gas makers The establishments very naturally in most cases reported the prevailing working time of the gas makerswhich is usually 72 hours or more per weekas the prevailing time for the establishment, and statistics classifying the total number of wage earners according to the \"prevailing\" working time reported doubtless exaggerate the actual number of wage earners for whom these were the prevailing hours In the United States as a whole there were 474 wage earners employed in establishments which reported 48 hours or less as the \"prevailing\" working time, 21 in establishments which reported more than 48 but less than 54; 1,049 in establishments which reported 54; 2,716 in establishments which reported more than54 but less than 60; 5,806 in establishments which reported 60; 5,786 in establishments which reported more than 60 but less than 72; and 21,363 in establishments which reported 72 hours or more pei: week Character of ownershipTable 7 presents data with respect to the character of ownership of the establishments in the gas industry for 1909 and 1904 -The most important distinction shown is that between corporate and all other forms of ownership In 1909, of the total number of establishments reported for the industry, 842 per cent were under corporate -ownership, as compared with 914 per cent in 1904 In 1909 these establishments reported 99 per cent of the entire value of products reported In this industry municipal operation is of greater importance than in any other branch of manufactures The 130 establishments reported for \"other\" forms of ownership reported products valued at $1,482,858 These were practically all municipally owned gas works The large gas works of Philadelphia, although owned by the city, are operated by a private corporation, and have been classed with corporate enterprises in the table -Table 8 gives statistics concerning the number of establishments operated under the different forms of ownership, by states It will be noted that, except for Minnesota, where gas works operated by municipalities outnumbered all others, corporate ownership predominates over all other forms There were eleven establishments reported under \"all other\" forms of ownership, eight of which were cooperative associations -A considerable mcrease in the number of small estab lishmentsthose with products valued at less than $5,000occurred between 1904 and 1909, which h accounted for in large part by an increase in the number of small acetylene gas plants -In some respects, and especially from the standpoint of conditions under which persons who are engaged in manufacturing work1 the best classification of establishments to bring out the feature of size is a classification according to the number of wage earners employed Table 10 gives such a classification of the gas manufacturing establishments in the leading states -The gas industry is characterized by the relatively small number of wage earners required to carry on the business, particularly the manufacturing process Of the 1,296 establishments reported, 83 per cent employed no wage earners, 487 per cent employed only from 1 to 5 wage earners, and 238 per cent from 6 to -20 On the other hand, establishments employing 21 wage earners and over, of which there were only 249, reported a total of 32,404 wage earners, or 87 1 per cent of the total number There were only 4 establishments reporting over 1,000 wage earners each, but these establishments reported 223 per cent of the total number of wage earners E∑xpenses,As stated in the Introduction, the census figures for expenses do not purport to represent the total cost of manufacture, since they take no account of depreciation, and for other reasons, and consequently they can not properly be used for determining profits Facts of interest can be brought out, however, con-cerning the relative importance of the different classes of expenses which were reported Table 11 shows in percentages, for 19091 the distribution of -these expenses m the leading states Table 11 PER CENT OF TOTAL EXPENSES REPORTED: 1000 STATE, Miscellaï Salaries Wages Materials neons -In the United States as a whole 462 per cent of the total expenses reported for the gas industry were incurred for materials, 184 per cent for wages, 109 per cent for salaries, and 245 per cent for other purposes For all industries combined the corresponding proportions were 658, 186, 51, and 105 per cent, respectively -As a general rule, in those states where the proportion shown for the cost of materials is highest, the prices of coal and other fuel used as material are high; on the other hand, in states with a plentiful supply of suitable fuel, the proportion for materials is relatively low The extremely high percentage of the total expenses shown for miscellaneous expenses in New Jersey, 523, was due chiefly to peculiar conditions; most of the miscellaneous expenses reported were designated as for \"rent of factory\" (see Table 22), an item which usually does not appear at all in the returns The proportion reported for wages is low in certain states where a good deal of the distributing branch of the business is conducted by separate concerns not covered by the census, or where, on the other hand, the gas manufacturing establishments themselves buy part of their gas from other concerns, especially coke manufacturers A more detailed analysis of the statistics of expenses is possible from Table 22, which gives the figures in detail for all the states -Engines and powerThe amount of power used in the industry was first reported at the census of 1869 Table 1, which gives data for the gas manufacturing industry as a whole, shows that the total horsepower used increased from 2,768 in 1869 to 128,350 in 1909 Table 12 shows the number of engines or other motors, according to their character, employed in generating power (including electric motors operated by purchased current), and their total horsepower, as reported at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899 It also shows -separately the number and horsepower of electric motors, including those operated by current generated in the establishment -Table 13 shows, for 1909, the amount of each of the several kinds of power and of the different kinds of fuel used in the industry in the 15 leading states -rhe states which ranked highest with respect to amount of power used in 1909 were New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Michigan, and Indiana The total horsepower reported for these states in 1909 was 91,338, or 712 per cent of the aggregate for the United States Steam was the most important power in all of the states shown separately, with the exception of Minnesota, where water power was the most important Of the power of gas and other internalcombustion engines, the greatest amount, 1,441 horsepower, was reported for Wisconsin The greatest amount of water power, 1,509 horsepower, or 536 per cent of the total for the country, was reported for Minnesota -Fuel consumedThe statistics relating to fuel, shown in Table 13, include fuel used for all purposes, both as material for gas making and for boilers and retorts, but the figures for fuel used as material in the gas -making process, which represents by far the greate part of the fuel used in the industry, are shown sepa~ rately in Table 14 Owing to the lack of an exact standard of comparison between fuels of different kinds, it is difficult to determine with accuracy the comparative importance of the different states from the standpoint of tho total consumption of fuel in the manufacture of gas Now York is :first in im portance undoubtedly, as it leads the other states in the use of anthracite coal, of bituminous coal, and of oil, and is second only to Illinois in the quantity of coke used Illinois and Pennsylvania report about equal quantities of coalanthracite and bituminous togetherbut Illinois uses considerably more coke and oil than Pennsylvania In California the scarcity of coal suitable for gas making and the large supply of oil are indicated by tho fact that oil is practically the only fuel used in the industry ∑ -The United States as a wholeThe special schedule used in collecting the statistics for the gas industry required a detailed statement of the quantity and cost of the different kinds of fuel used as material, and of the quantity and value of the different products manufactured Table 14 shows the statistics for the United States for 1909, 1904, and 1899 -crease of 1544 per cent Oil is, and has been for several censuses, the principal material used in respect to value, with coal second in importance -The greatest percentages of increase in quantity are for acetylene gas, oil gas, and straight water gas, in the order named, although the quantities of each of these kinds are still comparatively small Acetylene gas increased 2196 per cent from 1904 to 1909; oil gas, 1525 per ce1lt; and straight water gas, 1412 per cent -There was a decrease of 8 per cent in the production of coke for sale between 1904 and 1909, but the production of tar for sale increased 16 per cent These figures do not include coke and tar made and consumed in the same establishment -The following products were made in establishments in the gas inclustly proper and eonsumed by them in -Table 14 also shows, for each census, the average cost of each of the four _classes of materials specified and the average value of each of the different kinds of gas and other products -There was some increase between 1899 and 1909 in the average cost per ton of coal used for gas making, but this is possibly attributable in part to the erection of new gas plants at points distant from the coal producing regions ∑ The average value of oil consumed by gas works was the same in 1899 and 1904, but declined slightly between 1904 and 1900, this decrease doubtless being clue partly to the greatly increased production of crude oil in the United States and to the use for gas purposes of large quantities of oil derived from the cheap new crude oils of Oklahoma, lexas, California, and other states Nearly threetenths of the oil used for gas making in the United States in 1909 was used in New York and more than onesixth was used in California -In the United States as a whole there was in 1909 no very great difference in the average value per thousand cubic feet of straight coal gas, carbureted water ∑gas, and mixed coal and water gas, the three most important classes The average value of straight water gas, however, was materially lower than that for the other four classes, while, on the other hand, the average value of oil gas, which is a, comparatively important class, was materially higher, and that of acetylene gas, much higher -For the United States as a whole the average value per thousand cubic feet of all gas made by establishments in the gas industry was $103 :in 1899,$1 in 1904, and $0 92 in 1909 This decrease in average value can not bo attributed to changes in the 1elative importance of different classes of gas On the contrary, the production of oil gas and acetylene gas, whicn are more valuable than the other kinds, though still comparatively small, has increased more rapidly than the production of the other varieties On the other hand, it does not necessarily follow from this decrease in average value that there has been a general reduction in the rates charged to consumers In many cases gas companies charge a lower rate for gas used for cooking, heating, or power than for that used for lighting If, under such circumstances, in the case of a given company the consumption of gas for heating, cooking, and power should increase more rapidly than the consumption for lighting, there might be a reduction in the avemge price or value of all gas made by the company without any change whatever in rates There are wide varia-tions among individual companies with respect to the method of fixing rates for gas In some cases a single company has a variety of different rates and in some the price is based on a sliding scale according to quantity consumed -Materials and products, by statesTable 17 shows, by states, the quantity and cost of the different materials used in gas making in 1909 The quantities of fuel given in the table represent only that used for gas -making and not that used for power or for heating th0 retorts, the total cost of which is given separately , Table 14 The table also shows the quantity of cok~ tar, and gasmade by ?as wo_rks and consumed by th~ same establishments m then∑ further processes, No values are assigned to the materials so used, nor does their value appear in the total value of products All ~he data relate only to the establishments in the gas mdustry proper -Marked <lifferences appear among the states with respect to the relative importance of coal and oil, respectively, as materials for gas making Thus in Illinois the amount spent for oil was slightly less than that spent for coal and coke combined, in Pennsylvania it was only slightly greater, and in New York it was considerably greater, while in California there was virtually no expenditure for coal and coke for gas making On the other hand, in Massachusetts the expenditure for coal and coke was more than double that for oil, and in Michigan it was over six: times as great -Table 18 shows the quantity and value of all gas and of the different kinds of gas manufactured in 1909, by states, and also the quantity and value of coke, tar, and other byproducts manufactured for sale as such (not including such products manufactured for consumption in the same establishment), together with the amounts received from rents and sales of lamps and appliances -approximately the same as the ranking with respect to value of products of the gas industry, as shown in Table 2 InNewYork in1909 the production amounted to 45,768,354,000 cubicfeet, or 303 per cent of the total for the United States The production u1 Illinois co11stituted 127 per cent of the total a11d that mPellllsylvania 94 per cent, while no other state coutributed as much as onefifteenth of the total output -Marked differences appear among the states with respect to the relative importance of the different kinds of gas made For example, in New York about threefourths of all the gas made u1 1909 was carbureted water gas, while in New Jersey only about onesixth was of that class, and in California almost ninetenths of the total was oil gas -The states have quite a different rank with respect to the production of coke for sale from that which they occupy with respect to the production of gas This is due to the differences among the states with respect to the kind of gas made -Indiana_ Iowa Kentuckyïïïïïïïïïïïïïïïïïï Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Missouri  New York: Ohio  -Table 19 presents statistics as to the mileage of gas mains of establishments in the gas industry proper, and as to the number of stoves and heaters connected with the mains -The states have quite a different rank with respect to the mileage of gas mains from that which they occupy with respect to the production of gas Thus, while New York and Illinois, respectively, ranked first and second in 1909 as to both of these items, the production of gas in New York was much more than twice as great as in Illinois, while the mileage of mains re-ported from New York exceeded that reported from Illinois by less than 30 per cent California ran~ed fifth in 1909 in the production of gas, but ranked th~d in mileage of gas mains The relative length of mams required to distribute a given quantity of gas depends, of course, upon the density of the populatio~ served and the consumption per capita Wbere there1s alarge consumption of gas for heat and power, the length of mains is likely to be less in proportion to the output of gas than where the gas is chiefly consumed for lighting -Table 20 presents, for 1909 and 1899, by states, the average value per thousand cubic feet of gas of all kinds combined made by establishments classified as engaged in the gas industry The comparability of the :figures for the different states is slightly affected by differences in the proportions of the several kinds of gas manufactured, but it is much more∑ affected by dillerences in local conditions as to cost of materials, methods of distribution, the uses to which gas is put, the density of the population served, and the like In some states gas manufacturing companies buy part of the gas which they distribute from producers of natural gas or from operators of byproduct coke ovens, but, on the other hand, there are some companies covered by the sta-tistics which do not distribute gas to the consumer but deliver it to other concerns for that purpose, in which case, of course, the value reported is materially lower than the price ultimately paid by the consumer -The most conspicuous fact shown by the table is the decline in the average value per thousand cubic feet in most of the states In 38 of the 44 states listed there was some decline between 1899 and 1909, and in a number of these states the fall was very great As already indicated, these reductions in average value do -not necessarily represent corresponding reductions in the rates charged for gas under given conditions -The conspicuous increase in the average value of manufactured ga~ shown for Kansas is due chiefly to t~e fact that d~rn1;g the decade natural gas was substituted for artificial gas in the greater part of the state, so that the plants returned for 1909 were few distant from sources of materials, and in small places The conditions in West Virginia, where the average value also showed a considerable advance1 are somewhat similar to those in Kansas The increase in average value shown for Pennsylvania is attributable at-least in part, to the fact that the gas supplied to the ~ity _of Philadelphi_a for street and other municipal lightmg was not assigned a value in the report for 1899 although the quantity was included, while in 1909 both the quantity and the value of such gas were reported The only other states in which the average value of gas∑ reported was higher in 1909 than in 1899 were Dela ware and Maryland -per~ons engaged in t~e industry, prin:ary horsepower, capital mvested, salanes, wages, cost of materials, value of products, and value added by manufacture, and Tablo 22 giving more detailed statistics for 1909 -Scope of the industry,This :industry includes only such establishments as are engaged primarily in the refining of crude petroleum by distillation Establishments which purchase refined or partly refined petroleum products and compound them with vegetable, animal, or mineral oils, or other substances, in order to produce a special composition are, therefore, excluded Comparison with earlier censusesAlthough crude petroleum was utilized commercially in the United States prior to 1879, the statistics for the petroleum refining industry given in the census reports prior to -that time are not c,omparable with those for the later censuses In 1859, 78 establishments were reported with products valued at $6,397,680, and in 1869 there were 170 establishments reported, with products valued at $26,942,287 Table 1 summarizes the statistics of the industry for each census from 1879 to 1909, inclusive It should be noted that aJthough the statistics for the industry cover all the crude petroleum refineries in the country they do not show the total number of these refineries  because several of them are sometimes reported as a single establishment (See Introduction) -1 A minus sign() denotes decrease Where percentages are omitted, comparable figures aro not available -The industry advanced steadily during the 30 years covered by Table 1, the amount of petroleum refined in 1909 being almost seven times as great, and the cost of materials and value of products each being over five times as great as in 1879 The increase in the number of wage earners was comparatively slight, 411 per cent during the 30year period At the census of 1909 one of the largest companies in the United States made separate reports for their box, cooperage, and tin shops, which at prior censuses had been included with the reports for the refineries This has considerably affected the number of wage earners shown for the industry in 1909 as compared with those for p1∑ior censuses During the decade 18991909 the average number of wage earners increased from 12,199 to 93426∞1342 -Separate figures for 1909 only are given in Table 22 for each of the three states shown in Table 2, and also for Kansas and Oklahoma Tho statistics for the remaining states can not be shown separately without disclosing individual operations, but the following table shows for 1909, 1904, and 1899 the rank of each state in number of wage earners, value of products, and value added by manufacture -Persons engaged in the industryTable4 shows,for 1909, the numbe1∑ of petsons engaged in the petroleum refining industry, classified according to occupational status and sex, and in the case of wage earners, according to age also It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage eamers in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction, -In orde1∑ to compare the distribution of the per~ons engaged in the industry in 1909 according to occupational status with that in 1904 it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 5 -Although wage earners at both censuses represented more than 80 per cent of the total number of persons engaged in the industry, their number decreased 169 per cent from 1904 to 1909, while salaried employees shows an increase of 352 per cent for the :fiv;e years -Table 6 shows the average number of wage earners in the industry distributed according to age, and in the case of those 16 years of age and over, according to sex, for 1909, 1904, and 1899 The number of women and children employed was so small that figures relative to increases and decreases have little significance -Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 7 gives the number of wage earners employed in the industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 for the six states in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed -1 The month of maximum employment for each state is indicated by boldface figures and that 01 minimum employment by italic figures -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 8 the wage earners in the industry have been classified according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours -prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or smaller number of hours -Practically all (997 per cent) of the wage earners employed in the industry in 1909 were in establishments where the prevailing number of hours were 54 or more per week Of the seven groups shown in -622 per cent of the total number This group was the most important, likewise, in all but two of the states for which figures are given In Texas the wage earners in establishments where the prevailing hours per week were 72 or over formed the largest group, while in Ohio 60 hours per week was the most common working time AVERAGE NUMDEn OF WAGE EARNERS IN TIIE

three states, California, Pennsylvania, and Oklahoma, Pennsylvania being the only stilte in which such establishments were of importance Of the 41 establishments in Pennsylvania, 4 were under individual ownership, 9 under firm ownership, and 28 under corporate ownership; those under individual ownership gave employment to an average of 99 wage earners, or 34 per cent of -Size of establishmentsT1iblo 10 presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for estnblishmonts grouped according to the valuo of their products -Moie than 99 per cent of the value of products of the industry both in 1909 and 1904 was reported by establishments with products to the value of at least $100,000, and nearly 90 per cent u,t each census WM reported by establishments having products to the value of $1,000,000 or over The gain of this latter class of establishments in value of products was more than 35 per cent Establishments with products of less than $100,000 in value constituted nearly 30 per cent of the total number at both censuses -Table 11 classifies the establishments in the leading states in the petroleum refining industry according to the number of wage earners employed -ExpensesAs stated in the Introduction, the census figures representing expenses do not purport to show -The total primary power used in the industry increased from 36,127 horsepower in 1899 to 90,268 horsepower in 1909, or 1499 per cent during the decade In 1909, as in 1904 and 1899, steam was the principal source of power, though gas and other internalcombustion engines were relatively more important in this industry than in most of the other industries in the United States Little purchased electric current was used at either census, but between 1899 and -1909 there was an increase from 925 to 8,808 in the horsepower of motors run by current generated in the establishments reporting -Fuel consumed,Since the chief method of renning petroleum is that of distillation, the use of a large amount of fuel is necessary, not only to produce the heat used ii1 the distillation, but in the generation of power Naturally a large portion of the fuel used for both heat and power is gas or oil, since in most sections of the country where oil abounds natural gas is obtainable and is utilized Of the 3,473,758 barrels of oil reported as usE)d for fuel in the refineries in 1909, 1,286,666 barrels, or 37 per cent of the total, was -The cost per barrel of crude petroleum from the different fields, as computed from Table 14, varies considerably, ranging from 75 cents in California and 98 cents in the MidContinent fields to $138 in Illinois and $194 in Pennsylvania This variation is due largely to differences in the chemical composition of the oil and its physical freedom from foreign substances Tho average cost per barrel for the entire country was $126 -The total cost of all materials used m the indu t increased 937 per cent during the decade ending ;i~{ 1909 The cost of crude petroleum alone increas d -The combined value of illuminating oils, naphtha and gasolino, lubricating oils, and fuel oil was $209,666,088, or 885 per cent of the total value of products of the industry Illuminating oil was by far the most important product in 1∞909 as measured by value, but was second in respect to quantity Fuel oils, of which 34,034,577 barrels were reported, ranked first in quantity and fourth in value Naphtha and gasoline ranked second in value and third in quantity -2568 percent in value At censuses previous to 1909 all the di:ff erent lubricating oils were included under the four 1 ∑ ds of such oils named in the table At the census o!t 1909, however, lubricating oils not properly belongirig to either of the four classes named were grouped together under the separate classification \"all other\" lubricating oils -Illuminating oils, fuel oil, reduced lubricating oil, and paraffin wax show a greater percentage of increase in quantity than in value, but in the case of naphtha and gasoline and of paraffin lubricating oil the value increased much more than the quantity Grease was -the only product of the industry for which a decrease was shown in quantity The value of distillates and of separated acid produced is included in the total for \"all other products\" -It is impossible to give statistics by states concerning the quantity of crude petroleum obtained from different fields or for the quantities of the different products -∑ without disclosing the operations of individual establishments Table 17, however, shows for the United States and for the leading states, what proportion of the crude oil used in the petroleum refineries in 1909 was obtained from each of the several producing fields, and also the ratio (expressed in percentages) between the quantity of crude oil used and the respective quantities of the principal products -147 02 17, 0 112 18 ∑∑o:i In the United States the quantity of illuminating oils obtained was equal to 33 per cent of the quantity of crude petroleum used; that of fuel oil, to 335 per cent; that of lubricating oil, to 106 per cent; that of naphtha and gasoline, to 107 per cent; and that of other products, to 28 per cent The table shows considerable variation in the proportion of the different products obtained from the oil used by refineries in the various states For instance, the refineries in California, which used oil solely from the California field, obtained illuminating oil equal to 153 per cent of the quantity of crude oil; fuel oil, 347 per cent, and lubricating oil, 16 per cent; while for the refineries of Pennsylvania, using principally oil from Pennsylvania and -Exports of petroleum produots,Table 18 shows for 1880, 1890, and for each year from 1900 to 1910, inclusive, the production of crude petroleum in the country, and the quantity and value of the several petroleum products exported In order to present figures showing the total production of crude petroleum for years corresponding with those given for exports in Table 18, it was necessary to obtain the same from the reports of the United States Geological Survey, which bureau secures annual statistics of such products -Exports of petroleum products have, with a few exceptions, increased each year Nearly twothirds of the total amount of petroleum products exported in 1910 consisted of illuminating oils The grouping of the products shown in Table 18 does not correspond exactly with the grouping given in Table 17, but, taken m conjunctlon with Table 16, it nevertheless affords a fair comparison of production with exports It is rmpracticable to determine what proportion of the totn,l petroleum products are exported, but Table 19 gives, for 1909, 1904, and 1899, the percentage that the exports

increase in importance from census to census It should be noted, however, that this development was due largely to the growing importance of the soapmaking branch of the industry The manufacture of candles as a distinct industry or in connection with soap making is becoming less important, since large quantities are now made by establishments engaged primarily in re:fining petroleum -Summary, by statesTable 3 gives the more important statistics for the soap industry, by states, the states being arranged according to the value of products reported for 1909 Some states for which data can not be

District of Columbia Notwithstanding the number of states reporting the manufacture of soap, the industry is largely centralized, the 4 leading states in 1909, New York, Illinois, Ohio, and New Jersey, together reporting 656 per cent of the total number of wage earners, 67 per cent of the value of products, and 668 per cent of the value added by manufacture New York is the most important

cent in 1904 -Table 9 gives statistics for soap factories classified according to form of ownership for each state in which -In 1909, of the to~al number of wage earners re ported for the soap

cent of the total number of establishments, gave employment to 754 per cent of the wage earners, and reported 793 per cent of the total value of products In Pennsylvania, on the other hand, corporations operated 169 per cent of the establishments, employed 151 per cent of the wage earners, and contributed only 86 per cent of the total value of products -Size of establishmentsTable 10 presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for establishments grouped according to the value of their products -Table 11 classifies the establishments in the six leading states according to tho number of wage earners employed -Expenses,As stated in the Introduction, the census :figures representing expenses do not purport to show the total cost of manufacture, since they take no account of inte:rest or depreciation; hence they can not properly be used for determining profits Facts of interest can be brought out, however, concerning the relative importance of the different classes of expense which were reported Table 1 shows the total expenses in 1909 to have been $98,226,337, distributed as follows: Cost of materials, $72,179,418, or 735 per cent; wages, $6,226,882, or 63 per cent; salaries, $5,505,549, or 5 6 per cent; and miscellaneous expenses, made up of advertising, ordinary repairs of buildings and machinery, insurance, traveling expenses, and other sundry expenses, $14,314,488, or 146 per cent Naturally there are variations in the proportions of total expenses in the several states, owing to differences in the amount of expenditures for advertising and in the kinds of soap produced, the better kinds requiring more expensive materials and probably a higher paid class of labor The cost of tallow, grease, and other fats and oils constitute the principal item of expense in the cost of materials in this industry -Engines and power,Table 12 shows statistics of power used in the soap industry as reported at the ï censuses of 1909 and 1904 -864 per cent in 1909 Rented electric power shows a considerable increase, and its proportion of the total primary power increased from 26 per cent in 1904 to 7 per cent in 1909 The horsepower of electric motors used for distributing power by means of current generated in the establishments in the industry also shows a marked increase Table 13 shows, for 1909, the amount of the several kinds of power and of the diflerent kinds of fuel used in six: of the leading states -In 1909 New York, Illinois, and Ohio together reported 515 per cent of the total power used in the industry Steam was the most important form of power in all of the leading states -being consumed in 1909 Gas and oil were also used to some extent, the largest quantity of the former beip_g reported from Ohio The largest quantity of anthracite coal, 27,240 long tons, or nearly onehalf the total for the industry, was reported for New Jersey -MaterialsTable 14 shows statistics for the principal materials used in the industry in 1909 and 1904 -Each of the materials for which separate statistics are given in Table 14 shows an increase in cost, with the exception of caustic soda, and all but tallow, grease, and other fats and caustic∑ soda show an increase in quantity The cost of\" all other materials\" increased 1305 per cent The relatively large amount shown for this item is due to the fact that it includes the cost of the principal materials used in the manufacture of cottolene, a secondary product manufactured to a considerable extent by establishments in the soap industry in 1909 It also includes the cost of a considerable proportion of the ingredients used in producing the materials listed in Table 15, as well as the cost of boxes and other containers -In addition to the materials purchased, as shown in Table 14, considerable quantities of similar materials were produced by establishments in the soap industry and used by these establishments in further processes of manufacture Table 15 shows the quantities of such materials for 1909 and 1904 -factured was included under the cost of \"all oth materials\" shown in Table 14 Combining the qu/r tity of cottonseed oil shown in fables 14 and 15 git a total of 26,644,555 gallons used in the industry ~s -ProductsAs previously explamed, considerable quantities of soap and other products similar to t~ose made in soap _factories were reported by estabhshmonts engaged primarily in other industries Table 17 shows the total quantity and value of all soap products and of glycerin reported as manufactured in 1909 and in 1904 by establishments in tho industry and also by establishments in other lines of manufacture, -The total value of products for the industry in 1909 was $111,357,777, which includes products other than soap to the value of $15,417,890 These products consisted principally of food preparations, patent medicines and compounds, chemicals, coffee and spices, and grease and tallow During the fiveyear period 19041909 the total quantity of hard soaps, including that produced by establishments in the soap industry and as subsidiary products by establishments in other industries, increased 274 per cent, and in value 548 per cent The quantity of soft soap increased 368 per cent, and the value 668 per cent -In the manufacture of soap considerable quantities of glycerin are liberated of which the manufacturers appear to have imperfect record The quantity recovered is subject to great variation, dependent not only on the character of the stock used and its treatment in the kettle, but also on the efficiency of the method of recovery employed In the reports received for 1909, in addition to the quantity of glycerin reported among the products of the industry, it was estimated that 5,622,838 pounds were recovered for which no value was reported It has been noted (see Table 15) that the quantity of glycerin made for use in the same establishment was 5,816,279 pounds, and Table 17 shows a production of 81,905,915 pounds for which value is reported It would appear, therefore, that the total production of glycerin in all the manufacturing establishments in 1909, including those in the chemical and other industries, was 93,345,032 pounds This amount represents an increase of 42,374,015 pounds, or 831 per cent over the amount reported in 1904; it should be stated, however, that this increase in the quantity reported is due, in part, to a more thorough canvass of the industry at the later census The schedule for the census of 1909 called for the quantity and value of the different classes of hard soap -made during the year Some of the principal manufacturers could not furnish separate values for the different classes, and there was some confusion due to the fact that the distmction between the different kinds is not clearly marked The quantities of the different kinds manufactured in 1909 and 1904 are shown for all establishments in the industry in Table 18 -Hard soaps:Tallow

value added by manufacture Table 21 gives more detailed statistics for 1909 only -Scope of the reportThis report covers the production of commercial spirits of turpentine and rosin by the distillation of the resinous exudation of the pine tree, the crude resin being derived from the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), which is indigenous to a large coastal area stretching from North Carolina to eastern Texas, and, to a less extent, from the Cuban or slash pine (Pinus heterophylla) and the loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) Similar products, such as \"wood spirits,\" rosin oil, and tar, obtained directly from the pine wood by destructive distillation or by the steam -process,\" are not covered by the statistics of production here presented, though small quantities of wood spirits figure in the statistics of turpentine exported -Comparison with earlier censusesTable 1 summarizes the statistics of the turpentine and rosin industry for each census from 1869 to 1909, inclusive -The financial :figures for 1869 are given in currency, which at that time was worth only about 80 cents, gold, to the dollar For strict comparison, therefore, these figures should be reduced about 20 per cent -1 A minus sign () denotes decrease Where percentages nro omlttrd comparable tlgures are not available -ï Comparable tlgures not available ï The capital reported for 1899 included timber land, valued at $5,622,040 The 1,585 establishments in the turpentine and rosin industry in 1909 gave occupation to 44,524 persons, of whom 39,511 were wage earners The value of products was $25,295,017; the cost of materials, however, was only $4,910,838, or 194 per cent of the value of products, the value added by manufacture being $20,384,179 The relatively small proportion whicµ the cost of materials forms of the value of products in this industry is due to the fact that the principal material is taken directly from the trees by the establishments in the industry and that most establishments reported the cost of gathering this material among the other expenses of the industry and not as a part of the cost of materials In a certain sense the processes by which the crude gum is obtained from the pine trees are scarcely manufacturing processes, but it is quite impossible in many cases to distinguish the expenses connected with this branch of the business from those connected with the distillation of the gum -232 per cent in the number of establishments and 781 per cent in the capital invested is attributable principally to the development of new territory, especially in the Gulf states, and the building of additional, and as a rule larger, plants The installation of more expensive apparatus, such as that required for gathering the crude gum by the cup system, was also a factor to some extent in causing an increase in the capital invested In the value of products there was an increase of only 57 per cent between 1904 and 1909, which was due entirely to the higher prices obtained for rosin, as smaller quantities both of turpentine and of rosin were reported in 1909 than in 1904 The number of persons employed, however, and the amounts paid for salaries and wages, materials, and miscellaneous expenses show much larger percentages of increase than tho value of products, the decrease in output referred to being the result mainly of temporary and local conditions affecting the production of 1909, such as unfavorable weather for turpentine operations and destructive storms in Mississippi and Louisiana The largest relative increase in any item of expense, -893 per cent, is shown for \"miscellaneous expenses\" and the smallest, 11 7 per cent, for wages This is explained in part by the fact that the cost of convict labor was, in most cases, included in salaries and wages in 1904, but was almost uniformly reported under (679) -\"miscellaneous expenses\" in 1909 In addition, the cost of feed for live stock, wlrich is included under the heading of  miscellaneous expenses,\" was more folly reported in 1909 than :in 1904 -During the :flyeyear period 18991904 au :il1crea1e of 17 7 per cent took place in the value of products; this was due wholly to increased prices, however, as there was a decrease of nearly onefifth in the output both of turpentine and of rosin Of the various items of expense some show a large percentage of increase for this period and others a dem∑ease This is probably due to the fact that some expenses were included under different headings at the two censuses -While the Bureau of the Census issued no regular report on the turpentine and rosin industry for the years between 1904 a,nd 1909, trade reports, and statistics gathered by the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture, indicate that considerable development occurred during these years According to the Forest Service re1)orts the market value of turpentine and rosin produced amounted in 1907 to $35,600,400 and in 1908 to $31,895,950 These figures are not strictly comparable with the census figures for 1904 and 1909, however, as they represent the value of the products delivered at the market point, wlrich is considerably greater than the value at the place of manufacture, which constitutes the basis of the census figures -Development of the industryThe primitive method of charring woodunder sod in kilns or pits to extract tar and pitch was employed by the earlier settlers of the eastern coast of Virginia and tho Carolinas Because the use of tar and pitch at this period was practically restricted to slupbuilding they were called \"naval stores,\" by which term they, as well as spirits of turpentine and rosin, are still known The process of  bleeding\" the longleaf pine, or extracting from it crude resin, was, according to the most authentic available data, first undertaken ii1 North Carolina during the early or middle part of tlie eighteenth century Most of the resin thus gathered was shipped abroad to be refined, although a part of it was distilled in some of the larger cities of this country With the introduction of the copper still in 1834 it became possible to -convert the raw material into commercial spirits t turpentine and rosin noar the base of supply, whil gren,tly lessened tho cost of mn,nufacture The output of these prmlucts incronsod rapidly after this, and varied uses for tho products dovelopcd in the arts and in manufa_cturos Spir~ts ofturpentine and rosin arenow u~ecl clu?fly as mgrod10nts m such ?ommodities as paint, 011, varmsh, soap, paper, rubber, oilcloth, linoleum seal-ing wax, :fly papor, ink, lubricating compounds and medicinal preparations In recent years tar and 1pitch have come to be of littlo importanco, owii1g mainly to the diminished doman<l for them since tho general displacement of woo(lcn by iron nml steel ships -At tho census of 1810, which was the first to obtain statistics of this industry, 04,000 gallons of \"essence of ~ turpentii10,\" valued nt $138,000, were reported, this being the product of 24 stills in North Carolina The records of the Treasury Department show, however, that as far back as 1700 large quantities of turpentine, rosin, tnr, and pitch were boing exported each year, and thoro is ovidonco of tho oxportn,tion of such products at a considornbly cnrlier date -In 1849 tho irnlustry was lnrgoly

$2,476,252, or SG7 per cent of the total for the United States Of tho other establishments reported, the m!tjority were in South Carolina, a fow being located iii Georgi!t, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisian!t Since its early development in North Carolina the industry has gradually extended southward m1cl westward, following the course of the longleafpine bolt North Carolina continued to be the leading state in respect to value of turpentine and rosin products until 1879, when it was outranked by South Carolina In 1889 and 1899, Georgia led in value of products, but at tho fast two censuses Florida has rankecl first and Georgia sccoml -, Percentages are based on figures in rahle 26 A minus sign () denotes decrease lor cent not shown where base is less than 100 !or wage earners, or \\\\l!ls tha~ -The percentages given in the table show conspicuously the decline of the industry in the older turpentine producing states, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, and its growth in tho newer producing territory, Florida, Louisiana, and Alabama By far the gren,ter part of the increase in the turpentine ancl rosin i11dustry between 1899 and 1909 took place in Florida, for while Louisiana shows a very high percentage of increase, the value of its products even in 1909 represented only 46 per cent of the total The decline of the industry in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia between 1899 and 1909 was a continuation of a movement which began still earlier -The value added by manufacture, as already indicated, forms a much larger proportion of the value of products in this than in most other i11dustries For the United States as a whole it was, in 1909, equal to -806 per cent of the total value of products; for Florida the corresponding percentage was 835; for Georgia, 818; for Alabama, 803; for :Mississippi, 763; for Louisiana, 865; for North Carolina, 283; for South Carolina, 597; and for Texas, 808 The low proportions in the case of North and South Carolina are explained by the fact that for practically all of the establishments in North Carolina and for about half of those in South Carolina the total cost of procuring the crude gum, including the wages paid to woodsmen, etc, was reported as cost of materials The following diagram shows graphically the value of products reported for each state i11 1909: -Persons engaged in the industryTable 3 shows, for 1909, the number of persons engaged in the turpentine and rosin industry, classified according to occupational status and sex, and in the case of wage earners according to age It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -account of the work of the woodsmen Of the total number of persons engageJ in the industry, 44,426, or -998 per cent, were males and 98, or twotenths of 1 per cent, were females Most of the females were either proprietors or firm members, or wage earners, only 4 being reported as clerks The average number of boys under 16 years of age employed as wage earners was 586 Table 3 -In addition to the persons shown in Table 3 as engaged in the industry, 1,262 convicts were reported as employed under contract during the year (See lable 7 ) Including these, there were 45,786 persons engaged in the industry during 1909 -The organization of a turpentine farm consists of a manager or superintendent, woods riders and woodsmen, a \"stiller\" and his helpers, and teamsters The woodsmens duties consist in cutting boxes, hanging cups, \"chipping,\" \"dipping,\" \"raking,\" etc, and they work in squads consisting usually of from 10 to 20 men, under the supervision of a woods rider, who directs, inspects, and records the work clone Where establishments are owned by individuals or partners the owners generally manage the place and often do the woods riding -While experiments have been made from time to time with foreign labor, the negro has proven, thus far, the most practicable workman for this industry The arduous nature of the work precludes the employment of women and children to any extent -The average number of wage earners for each state, for 1909, 1904, and 1899, is given in Table 26 The distribution of tho average number by sex and age is not shown for the individual states, hut Table 27 gives such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, or the nearest representative day Female wage earners were reported for the representative day from only three of the eight states in which the industry is ca1Tied on, and more than fourfifths of the children reported for that day were in two statesFlorida and Georgia -In order to compare the distribution of persons engaged in the industry according to occupational status in 1909 with that in 1904, it is necessary to use the -classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 4 -Proprietors and :firm members show the greatest percentage of increase for the fiveyear period (286) The percentage of increase shown for wage earners (184), however, is somewhat below the true figure, owing to the fact that m1904 some convicts were included among the wage earners, while in 1909 all such laborers were reported separately -Table 5 shows the average number of wage earners distributed according to age, and in the case of those -Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 6 gives tho number of wage cnrnors employed on the 15th (or the nearest representntivo day) of each month during the year 1909 for the five states in which an average of 500 or more wage earners wore employed during the year -N0TETho month of maximum employment for each state is shown by boldface figures nnd that of minimum employment by Hallo figures -The number of employees required by an establishment in the turpentine and rosin industry averages about the same throughout the year, the work being distributed as follows: Cutting boxes or hanging cups in the winter months, chipping anq dipping in the spring and summer, and scraping and raking in the fall This fact is reflected in the decided uniformity in the numbers shown in Table 6 for the several months of the year In the industry as a whole the largest number of wage earners employed during any month of 1909 was 40,634 in July and the smallest 37,112 in January, the minimum number forming 913 per cent of the maximum -Convict laborIn two states convict labor was employed in 1909 under contract in the production of turpentine and rosin Table 7 shows the average number of convicts employed in 1909 and their cost to the operator, including hire and keep -At previous censuses convicts were included to some extent with other employees, but at the census of 1909 -they were reported separately and the amount paid the state under the contracts for their labor and also the expenses of their maintenance were included with \"miscellaneous expenses,\" under the heading of \"contract work\" -Prevailing hours of laborIn tho census statistics of mn,nufoctures wage earners are classified according to the prevailing hours of labor per week, reported on the schedules as tho hours normally worked by wage earners in the establishments in which they were employed In making this clnssi:fication, as explained mthe Introduction, all tho wage earners in a given establishment are classified as a group according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though some of the employees may have worked a greater or smaller number number of hours; in other words, no attempt has been nrnclo to take ac?ount of variations in hours within tho same establishment, For most industries, however, the result is believed to indicate the number of hours actually worked by the great mass of employees, hut in the turpentine and rosin industry, where the piecework system of wage payments is in very general use and the woodsme_n usually work irregular hours, tho classification on this basis is probably of doubtful significance The tabu; lation has nevertheless been made and the results ar -Character of ownershipfabie 9 presents data with respect to the character of ownership of the establish)Dents engaged in this industry -Of the total number of establishments reported for the industry in 1909, 498 per cent were operated by :firms, as compared with 482 per cent in 1904 The value of the products of such establishments represented 482 per cent of the total in 1909 and -522 per cent in 1904 Of the total number of wage earners in 1909, 279 per cent were employed in establishments operated by individuals, 49 per cent in those operated by firms, and 231 per cent in those owned by corporations Table 9 -∑ 1 Includes two establishments under \"Other\" lo111lB or ownership, to uvold the disclosure of individual

-Considerable variation appears in the relative importance of the establishments operated by individuals, firms, and corporations, respectively, in the different states Thus in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia firm ownership predominated, more than 50 per cent of both the average number of wage earners and the value of products being reported by firms in the two states last mentioned In Mississippi itnd Louisiana, where the industry is of more recent development, establishments operated by corporations gave employment to 755 per cent and 838 per cent, respectively, of the wage earners and reported 721 per cent and 852 per cent, respectively, of the value of products In North Carolina and South Carolina, the states where the industry had its beginning, establishments owned by individuals still constituted the most important class in 1909 In North Carolina they formed 709 per cent of all establishments in the -Establishments classified according to sizeTable 11 presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for establish-Tho table shows a considerable increase in the relative importance of establishments having products valued at $5,000 but less than $20,000, and a slight increase in the relative importance of the smallest establishmentsthose with products valued at less than $5,000and of the largest establishmentsthose which had products valued at $100,000 or over The proportion of the smaller establishmentsthose with products valued at !ess than $20,00~was mu~h larger in North Oarolma and South Oarolma than lll the other states -In some respects, and especially from the standpoint of conditions under which persons engaged in manufacturing work, the best classification of establishments to bring out the feature of size is a classification according to the number of wage earners employed Table 12 gives such a classification of the establishments in each state for which more than 500 wage earners were reported a,t the census of 1909, -12 l)er cent, employed no wage earners The largest number of establishments comprised in any group was that of establishments employing from 6 to 20 w earners (655, or 413 per cent of the total) and th age-ExpensesAs stated in the Introduction, the census figures for expenses do not purport to represent the total cost of manufacture, since they take no account of depreciation, and consequently can not properly be used for determining profits Facts of interest can, however, be brought out concerning the relative importance of the different classes of expenses which were reported Table 1 shows the total expenses in 1909 to have been $19,032,630, divided as follows: Wages, $9,363,359, or 492 per cent; salaries, $1,655,391, or 87 per cent; materials, $4,910,838, or 258 per cent; and miscellaneous expenses, which include tho cost of advertising, ordinary repairs of buildings and machinery, and insurance, traveling expenses, and other sundry expenses, $3,103,042, or 163 per cent As shown by Table 27, decided differences in the proportions of the several classes of expenses appear among the states These differences are clue chiefly to the fact (ulready mentioned) that in some states the cost of extracting gum from the -trees was quite uniformly reported under the items of wages, salaries, and miscellaneous expenses, while in other states many establishments included the cost of extraction under cost of materials or bought the gum from others -Engines and powerThe amount of power used in the turpentine and rosin industry was first reported at the census of 1899 Table 13 shows the number of engines orother motors, according to their character, employed in generating power, and their total horsepower, as reported at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899 -This table indicates that the totn1 primary power increased 2,954 horsepower, or 2514 per cent, from 1904 to 1909, and 309 horsepower, or 357 per cent, from 1899 to 1904 Little power is required by this industry, many establishments reporting no mechanical power at all; and where power is employed, a small plant, consisting of a boiler and a steam pump, used in forcing water from a well, stream, or lako to the tank of the still, often provides all that is necessary for the operation of the plant No electric motors were reported -Table 14 shows, for 1909, the amount of _eac~ of the several kinds of power and of the different kinds of fuel used in the five leading states -Fuel consumedThe principal fuel employed is wood, which is used chiefly in heating the furnace of the still The quantity reported for 1909 was 134,366 cords, but this amount does not represent all of the wood consumed as fuel, since large quantities were undoubtedly used of which no record was kept The -ProductsThe special schedule used in collecting statistics for the turpentine and rosin industry required a detailed statement of the quantity of crude gum distilled and the quantity and value of the turpentine and rosin produced, and also data in regard -value of the wood used is not included in the expenditure for fuel and rent of power, which is shown in Table 27, as it was for the most part cut from land owned or leased by the establishment and no cost was :involved, apart from the cutting and hauling, which were done by the regular wage earners -The total quantity of spirits of turpentine reported in 1909 was 23 2 per cent less than that reported in 1899, and its value 154 per cent less The quantity -,,:, 1∑l 24 9 per cent, but its value, owing to a marked increase in the price) shows an increase of 1452 per cent for the decade The average value of turpentine in 1899 was $0396 per gallon; in 1904, $0494; and in 1909, $0437 The average value of rosin per barrel of 280 pounds gross, as computed from the totals reported, was $118 in 1899, $249 in 1904, and $385 in 1909 Tho decreas~ in production throughout the decade was shared by all of tho states for which :figures are shown in Table 15, except Florida and Louisiana The marked decrease in the production of turpentine and rosin in North Carolina and South Carolina during the decade 18991909 was the result of the gradual extermination of the pine forests The few small tracts of pine remaining in those states are for the most part owned by farmers, who box the trees and sell the crude gum to distilleries or to dealers, or else have it distilled on a toll basis The decreases in Georgia) which were much more :importantin point of absolute amount than those in the Carolinas, are also attributable to the working out of the timber The industry in this state is conducted principally by small operators, many of whom take up new land in the Gulf states as their t:imber becomes exhausted, or else clear their land and devote their energies to farming or other pursuits The increase in production in Florida is the result of the development or new territory) especially in the western l)art of the state Florida will probably remain the leading state in this industry for a considerable period, if not indefinitely, for its whole area, with the exception of a small belt in the southern part of the peninsula, is peculiarly adapted to the growth of the resinous pilie The extensioll of transportation facilities during tho past few years has put great tracts of pine forest within easy reach of the markets The timber is larger and the growth denser in the western than in the eastern and southern sections of the state While the small operator predominates in Florida, there were 12 establishments in the state in 1909 which gave employment to an average of over 100 wage earners, as shown by Table 12 Alabama shows for the decade a decrease of about onefourth in the production both of turpentine and of rosin The turpentine section of this state has been pretty thoroughly worked, as the industry was of considerable :importance there as early as 1860, but much valuable timber still remains in the hands of a few large

durmg the 10year period 18991909, the increase in tho production of turpentine amounting to 4 721 per cent and in that of rosin to 486,3 per cent The vast forests of longleaf pine in western Louisiana and eastern lexas have never been worked for turpentine until within the last few years, They are controlled principnJly by large mill owners, who have refused to allow tho timber to be boxed, but since the introduction of the cup system many of theBe ∑ owners have either engaged in the turpentine industry themselves or have lmtsod thoir t:imber to others -In 1910 the Buroa,u of tho Census, in response to a demand from certain qumters, instituted what was intended to be an annual census of tho production of turpentine and rosin, but tho investigations were not continued after that year Tho data were collected from navalstores (factors,\" who aro tho middle men between tho producers and tho buyers, from jobbers, and from a few manufacturers who soll their products direct to the consurnors Tho difference between this method of collecting tho data and that used at the decennial census, whon nll individual producers were canvassed, possibly ronclors tho statistics for 1910 not  wholly comparable with thoso for 1909 Table 16 gives the statistics for 1()10, by states -Equipment and methods of operation,The manud facture of turpentine and rosin is generally conducte on what is called a (turpentil10 farm\" The form consists principally of a tract of timber land, _in ma~ cases leased by the operator for the turpentroe pn ∑ ileges, and is equipped with a still, cooper s~op, to~~~ dip barrels, draft animals, houses and shanties for -There are two chief systems of extract:ing gum from the trees, called the \"boxsystem\" and the \"cup system\" The first step in the gathering of the gum by the box system is the cutting of a box or cavity into the base of the tree by means of an axe, to receive the liquid gum, which is called  dip\" The box is usually from 6 to 12 inches wide, about 7 inches deep, and about 3Ω inches from front to back; the number cut into a tree varies from one to four -according to the size of the tree Box cutting usually begins in December and January and lasts until March This opemtion is followed by \"chipping/ which is the wounding or scarifying of the trunk of the tree directly above the box, a strip of - bark and sapwood about threefourths of an inch wide and from onehalf to one inch deep being removed from the tree This work is accomplished by means of a \"hack,\" a specially constructed tool consisting of a sharp steel blade made in the form of the letter U and attached to a stout wooden handle The first chipping takes place on the upper edge of the wound made by cutting and \"cornering\" the box The stroke with the hack is made from either side diagonally downward, terminating in the center and immediately above the box An exposed surface the width of the box is thus created, which is termed a \"face\" Chipping begins in March and April and continues at regular intervals for about 32 weeks The gathering of the gum, the flow of which is continuous throughout the chipping season, begins shortly after the :first wound is made and is continued at intervals of two or three weeks The dip is transferred from the box by means of a flat, trowelshaped instrument called a \"dipper\" into buckets and from the buckets into dip barrels placed at convenient intervals in the forest, which when filled are hauled to the still A seasons chipping extends the face of the tree upward a distance of about 24 inches After a tree has been worked about three seasons the face extends so far up the tree that it becomes necessary to use a \"puller,\" which is an instrument similar to the hack except that it has a long handle In flowing to the box a certain proportion of the crude resin coagulates on the face of the tree This residue, which is called \"scrape,\" is allowed to form undisturbed until toward the end of the season, when the flow of the gum has practically ceased It is then scraped off and caught in a box placed at the base of the tree, and from that transferred to the still in the same manner as dip The \"cup system\" of gathering the gum differs from the\" box system\" principally in the kind of receptacle used for collecting the crude gum, a clay or metal cup being substituted for the box cut into the tree itself -There are two kinds of cup systems in use, one being styled the \"cup and gutter system\" and the other the \"cup and apron system\" The fundamental principle of the two is the same, the J)Oints of difference consisting in the shape of the cup, the manner of adjusting it to the tree, and the equipment used in directing the gum to the cup The chipping of the tree begins above the location of the cup and continues upward in the same manner as when the box is used Either metal gutters or aprons, according to the system used, are inserted into the face of the tree in such a way as to direct the exuded gum into the receptacle The cup is easily detached from the tree, and its contents emptied into a bucket, the gum being scraped from the bottom and sides o:f the cup by means of a small paddle -At the close of the producing season the ground in the woods is carefully burned over in order to destroy the undergrowth, grass, and waste accumulation of the forests This is done as a precautionary measure against fire Before the burnmg takes place all resinous and other trash is cleared away from around the trees for a distance of about 3 feet in order to protect them from the fire, this process being known as \"raking\" -The gathering of the crude gum is followed by its distillation The still is a large copper kettle, incased in a brick jacket, and provided with a removable gooseneck cap Beneath the copper still is a grate, which is large enough to accomodate fourfoot wood In a \"charge,\" which requires from three to five hours for its distillation, the still usually contains from :five to eight barrels of dip or scrape As the still is heated and the vapors pass off, water is added to facilitate the evaporation of the spirits of turpentine and to prevent burning The mixed vapors of spirits of turpentine and water pass off through the gooseneck into a copper worm surrounded by water, the condensed liqui<l flowing into a barrel where the water and turpentine separate by gravity The spirits of turpentine is then transferred into tight whiteoak barrels or \"casks\" of about 50 gallons capacity, and is ready for shipment The residue in the kettle after the turpentuie has been distilled off is rosin, which, while molten, is drawn from a tap at the lower edge of the kettle into a vat sunk into the ground near the still In its course from the kettle to the vat it passes through three copper mesh strainers of different degrees of :fineness, the last of which is covered with a thin layer of cotton batting The material accumulated in this cotton batting is called \"batting dross\" This dross was formerly treated as a waste, being generally burned at the still, but within the last few years there has developed some demand for it for use in certain lines of manufacture The rosin while hot is ladled from tile vat into rough pine barrels, in which it is marketed These are termed \"round\" barrels and weigh approximately 510 pounds gross, the weight of the barrel itself being about -90 pounds Sales are made on this basis, but calculations ancl settlements are based on the \"commercial\" barrel, which weighs 280 pounds gross The statistics of: this report deal with the commercial barrel The amount of: rosin obtai;ned per barrel of spirits of turpentine averages from three to three and onehalf round barrels, or from five an<l onequarter to six commercial barrels -A tree, as a rule, is worked four years, the boxes of the first seasons working being generally referred to as \"virgin boxes,\" those of the second year as \"yearling boxes, and those of the fourth or :fifth yeiir as  old boxes\" After timber has been worked for four, or sometimes :five, years it is allowed to \"rest for several yearsgenerally about fourduring which time the wounds heal and its vitality is restored so that it is in condition to furnish another yield of gum Then new boxes are cut (this second working of the tree being termed \"back boxing\"), and chipping proceeds in the same manner as in the first instance Such timber is worked the same number of seasons and produces about the same grade of products as \"round\" timber, or that which is being worked for the first time Much timber is cut at the end of the first period of operation, the owners estimating its lumber value at this time to be greater than its value for the future production of turpentine -Crude gum distilledThe quantity of crude gum distilled in 1909 is shown in Table 17 The quantity is expressed in barrels, but thern was a very wide variation in the size of the barrels and it was found impracticable to reduce them to a common standard or an average size Except for Florida, where barrels for dip and those for scrape were uniformly reported as of a capacity of 500 and 300 pounds, respectively, there was no uniformity :in the capacity of barrels 9f either kind, the clip barrels ranging from 280 to 600 pounds and the scrape barrels from 200 to 400 pounds -1th1s:fiterme , t iefage o tle ?rop The gum obta~ed t e llst season a ter the box 1s cut or the cup set (f-grac es ff rosm _us 1s ue to the close proximit of the freshly cut resm ducts

also sustn,ined when either dip or scrape is withheld from the still longel than necessary -Comparison of box and cup systemsThe cup system came into use in 1904 after its practicability had been demonstrated by the Forest Service of the United States Department of Agriculture Its chief advan~ tages over the box system are that it causes less damage to the vitality and stability of the tree and secures a greater yield and a better quality of crude gum Owing, however, to its comparatively recent intro~ duction, the cost of its installation, and the fact that the manufacturers of cups lack facilities to supply the rapidly developing demand, the use of the cup has not as yet become general The cups for a \"crop\" cost approximately $500 delivered at the plant, and the operation of the system costs a little more than that of the box system Operators upon leased land, however, have been able to obtain decided concessions from the owners, conditional upon their using cups, and much timber has been utilized for turpentine operations which would have been withheld if it had been necessary to work it by boxes The indications are that, in time, the use of the cup system will be almost universal Table 19 shows, for each state, the number and percentage of crops worked by the box and the cup systems, respectively, in 1909 -Of the total number of crops reported, 118 per cent were worked by the cup system The percentage of crops worked by this system was largest in Texas and Louisiana New territory is being developed in these states, and it is natural to find a tendency to use improved methods Only two crops worked by the cup system were reported for North Carolina and none for South Carolina -Timber land controlled by turpentine operatorsThe forests of the South have been rapidly depleted during the past 50 years through turpentine operations and saw milling Pine forests were so abundant in the early days that no cure was taken for their preservation, and trees were worked for turpentine in such a careless manner as to sap their vitality and leave them a prey to disease, fue, and storm The Carolinas have been stripped almost bare of pine, the forests of Georgia have been greatly depleted, and deep inroads have been made in those of Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi In Louisiana and Texas, however, the forests have not suffered the unwarranted damage wrought in the other states -Table 20 shows the acreage of land reported as held by active turpentine operators on December 31, 1909 As the census inquiry was confmed to the collection of statistics from manufacturers, no data were obtained from companies or individuals who controlled timber -The table shows that turpentine opemtors controlledS,056,915 acres of timber land More than onehalf of this acreage was in Florida, while North Carolina reported a smaller 11,mount than any other state It ∑ was estimated by the establishments reporting that this land would afford in the future 13,632 vfrgin crops7,070 in round timber and 6,562 in backboxed timber In order to arrive at an estimate of tho total number of crops in workable timber controlled by turpentine operators on January 1, 1910, it is necessary to add to the number of virgin crops as given -The navalstores \"factor\"The \"factor\" is the middle man between the producer of turpentine oncl rosin and the distributor, and at tho some time tho confidential adviser and banker of the producer He carries no stock and does not sell to the consumer, his sales being mode either to the distributor or to tho dealer, who, in turn, sells to the consumer As a rule, the factor advances the funds and supplies for carrying on the seasons operntions, and when tho products are ready to be marketed they are shipped to him At several important ports thorn are storage yards for turpentine and rosin where, by on urrangement between the factors and the ownera of the yards, all shipments are received, inspected, grueled, and stored -subject to the factors order Sales are made as business exigencies worrant, but, os a rule, the products ore quickly disposed of -Inspection and gradingWhile there are minor differences in the local laws, practically the same rules and standards govern the inspection and grading of turpentine and rosin in all of the stutes The most extensive navalstorea yards are located in Savannah, Ga, und Jacksonville and Fernandina, Fla When turpentine or rosin is received at these yards, it passes into the hands of inspectors, who are sworn and bonded officials either of the state or of the cityJ und who are required to comply with certain specified state, -Every borrel of spirits of turpentine or rosin is carefully exominod, the weight and grode of its contents are branded upon the barrel, and sworn certificates as to the contents are made and furnished to the factor Laws as to misbranding and odulterating turpentine and rosin ure stringent Turpentine is graded according to color ond termed \"wutorwhite,11 \"standard,\" \"off one shade,\" \"off two slrndes,11 and \"off three shades,\" the lostnomed ∑grode not being merchantable There is a reduction of u few cents per gallon in the price of the off slmdes, us compared with the other grades It is tho custom, however, to odd a small quantity of colored to standard turpentine in barre)s which are not full, the revenue to the producer for his -colored turpentine being thus slightly increased Rosin is grueled according to its color, the lighter shodes constituting the higher grades The standard grodes are os follows: WW (wuterwhite), WG (window glass), N (extro pale), M (pale), K (low pale), I (e:x:tra No 1), H (No 1), G (No 1), F (good No 2), E (low No 2), D (good strained), and A, B, C, (corom_on strained) The yard expenses, such as storage, ID∑ surance, repairs to defective barrels, etc, are borne by the producer As turpentine ond rosin are sold to distributors and other buyers to be taken at the the transaction does not necessitate the -yards are equipped with immense steel storage tanks in which turpentine may be stored for any length of time for a specified sum per gallon; the number of gallons stored is certified to and owners may withdraw a part or the whole at any time -Method of establishing pricesThe method of establishing prices for turpentine and rosin is described in the following article prepared by Thomas Purse, superintendent of the Savannah Board of Trade, and printed in the Naval Stores Review (Savannah, Ga) for May 17, 1911 -For the past 28 years the Savannah Board of Trade, successor to the old Naval Stores Exchango, has had the duty imposed upon it of setting the prices on naval stores for the world Prices on spirits of turpentine and all grades of rosin (12 in number) are made twice each day by this association (11 a m and 4 p m, respectively) While the average man realizes in a vague way the importance of Savannah as a navalstores market, few outside of those directly interested in naval stores realize that the Savannah Board of Trade sets the prices for the world Savannah is the largest open\" market in this country The quotations at all other markets are based on Savannah The same thing applies to the markets in foreign countries where naval stores are quoted The location of Savannah is therefore peculiar, and its importance in the industry is inestimable The manner in which these quotations are arrived at is of some interest, even to those not in the trade The prices are determined by the committee on quotations, the members of which consist of two factors and two exporters This committee is appointed by the board of directors each 60 days It is necessary that a majority, or three out of the four members of the committee, vote together before a quotation can be posted In the event of a tie one factor and one exporter are added to the committee, and this procedure continues until a decision on the quotation has been reached -Each factor advises the superintendent of the board of trade daily of the number of casks of spirits of turpentine sold, and the prices, and the number of barrels of each grade of rosin sold, and prices obtained therefor Thia information is then consolidated by the superintendent and posted on the boards of the exchange The committee on quotations then make up their quotations for the day, basing same upon actual trllJlsactions reported -Four tones are used to indicate the state of the market firm, when everything is sold or there is a demand sufficient to absorb the offerings; \"steady,\" when only a portion of the receipts have been sold and some remain undisposed of in the factors hands; and \"quiet\" or \"dull\" when there is little or no demand and aII or the larger part of the receipts remain in first hands When there are no -sales of turpentine or rosin for two days, the receipts remauiing in the factors hands awaiting a purchaser, it is customary to describe the market condition by tlie use of tlte words nothing doing, with a statement as to the date of last sales and the prices then paid This remains upon the quotation board until actual transactions are reï ported on which to base new quotations Sales between buyers are not considered in making quotations, but only those between factors and buyers -Open and closed portsSavannah, Ga, and Jacksonville, Fla, are known as open ports, the presence o:f buyers of turpentine and rosin at these ports creating competition and thus influencing prices In Jacksonville receipta arc disposed of by sealed bids received by the factors The cities of Brunswick, Ga, PensMola, Fla, Mobile, Ala, and Gulfport, :Miss, ltre known as closed ports, as no competition exists at these ports The daily receipts of the factors at these ports are bought under contract, the prices being based upon the average closing quotations of the Savannah market That is, if more than one quotation prevails in Savannah, the producer receives a price midway between the highest and the lowest For instance, if turpentine is bejng quoted at from 50 to 53 cents, the producer who ships turpentine to these ports receives on that particular clay 51Ω cents per gallon While Fernan~ dina is a closed port, there being only one buyer located there, its receipts are not taken by contract daily, us in the other closed ports mentioned, but byagreement When a large buyer comes to the Jacksonville market and is successful in buying at his bid there, he takes the Fernandina receipts also on the same terms In New Orleans, although some competition exists, most of the receipts are taken under daily contract In Charleston and Wilmington the receipts are small and are disposed of according to private 11greement between the buyers and the sellers -Tablo 21 shows the rango of prices of spirits o:f turpentine and of the five most important grades of resin during the 11 years 18991909 These statistics were compiled from the records of the Savannah Board of Trade -exports of rosin over 65 per cent Both production and exports show a decrease for the fiveyear period -Table 23 shows the amount of turpentine and rosin exported to each of the six grand divisions of the world during 1910 and the percentage that the exports to each formed of the total -Of the total exports, 831 per cent of the turpentine and 774 per cent of the rosin went to Europe Of the European

Although New York is far removed from the producing section, 107 per cent of the turpentine and 148 per cent of the rosin exported were shipped from that port The greater part of the turpentine and rosin from Jacksonville, Fla, which is exported goes by way of Fernanclinn,, from which port are shipped also large quantities of Georgia products, -The principal data secured by the census inquiry concerning the turpentine and rosin industry are presented by states in Tables 26 and 27 -the industry, primary horsepower, capital invested, salaries, wages, cost of materials, value of products, and value added by manufacture -Summary for the three branches of the industry: 1909Table 1 presents a summary of the more important statistics of the boot and shoe industry as a whole for 1909, and also for its three branches The three classes of e~tablishments distinguished are (1) establishments whose chief products are :finished boots and shoes (including a few performing only special processes); (2) establishments whose chief products are boot and shoe cut stock, such as soles, heels, tips, inner soles, top lifts, etc; an<l (3) establishments whose chief products are boot and shoe findings, such as shoe pegs, bows, clasps, stays, rands, counters, shoe trimmings, etc Many of the establishments in class -1 which manufacture boots and shoes also make cut stock and findings, mostly for their own use, and the data for clttsstS 2 and 3, therefore, do not bring out the full importance of these branches of the busint\\\\ss rhe estnblishments in classes 2 and 3, on the other hand, do not manufacture any complete boots or shoes The value of the products of these two classes is largely duplicated in tlrnt for class 1, and therefore in the total value for the combined industry Except where otherwise expressly stated, the tables in this report present statistics for the industry as a whole -1In addition, products to the value of Sl,430,280 which pcrti1ined to the boot nnd shoe indnstry were produced by establishments primarily engaged in the manul:lcture of leather belting and hose; sporting and athletic goods; leather, tanned, curried, and finished; saddlery and harness; and other products -The products reported for the industry include products other than boots and shoes to the value of $1,276,414 These consist principally of leather; leather goods; blacking and cleansing and polishing preparations; and paste -Comparison with earlier censuses for the industry as a wholeTable 2 summarizes the statistics for the combined industry for each census from 1879 to 1909, inclusive -Although the manufacture of boots and shoes was one of the earliest manufacturing industries in the country, statistics which are comparable with those for the cellSUs of 1909 can not be shown for censuses earlier than 1879, because prior to that census d11ta for the factories were not dfatinguished from those for the numerous small shops engaged chiefly in custom and repair work

boots and shoes made more thnn doubled during tho 30 yoals -Very few industries have been moro uffectod by the introduction of machinery than the ∑ mnnufoctnro of boots and shoes, and to this fact may be i:Lttributed the relatively small increase shown in the iworuge number of wage earners during the 30yon,r period covered by the table In 1009 the amount paid in wages formed 192 per cent of the vu1ue of products, as compared with 251 per cent in 1879 ~Lhore was a decrease of 04 per cent in services between 1889 ancl 1899, and £m increase of 64 per cent in tho average number of wage earners

Statistics for establishments engaged chiefly in the manufacture of cut stock and of findings are not included in this table -89 l lhis table showa an increase during the 20year period in the number of custom shops and a decrease in the average number of wage earner, and value of products The large decrease shown in the average number of wage earners may be due to the fact that proprietors and firm members were first separately called for in 1899, and that many of them were probably reported as wage earners in 1879, since in a large number of the shops of this character -the proprietors perform the entire work In 1899 the rustom shops represented considerably more than ninetcnths of the total number of establishments for both classes combined, but contributed less than onetenth of the value of products -from the specialization in the industry designated \"boots and shoes, including cut stock and findings,\" which is indicated by the distinction of the three main branches shown in J)reVious tables, there is in certain cases still further specialization within that branch of the industry designated as the manufacture of boots and shoes proper :Most of the establishments assigned to this branch of the industry make complete hoots and shoes from stock either cut by themselves or purchased, but there are a number of factories assigned to the group which perform only special operations, uaually on materials furnished by others Thus some do only stitching, some make buttonholes, and others do crimping, while still others perform other processes The amount paid for these several processes becomes a part of the total value of products of the boot and shoe industry proper, nrnl to this extent there i,, a duplication of values Theile highly specialized establishments in the boot uncl shoe industry, however, are of comparatively small importance, as will be seen from Table 6, in whieh each establishment has been classified according to its product or

years of aga formed 337 por cent of the wage earners in the boot and shoe industry proper, 308 per cent in tho establishments engaged primarily in the mamrfocturo of findings, and 251 per cont in those manufacturing chiefly cut stock There woro no groat differences among the thrne branches of tho industry as to the relative numbers of women and children employed ]UtANCH 011 tNillrfilnY ANn CfARH lll! lEHSONS, ~ -Table 11 shows, for each of the 17 leading states in the boot and shoe industry, by percentages, the distribution according to sex and age of the wage earners employed December 15, 1909, or the nearest representative day -In all of the states listed women (16 years of age ancl, over) formed in 1909 a very considerable proportion of the total number of wage earners, the lowest proportion, 218 per cent, being reported from Virginia, and the highest, 535 per cent, from Connecticut In Massachusetts, the most important state in the industry, 322 per cent of the wage earners were women, and in Missouri, the next state in importance, 318 per cent -The proportion of children under 16 years of age among the total number of wage earners varied very ~aterially from state to state The lowest proportion for any state covered by the table was that in Mmnesota, fivetenths of 1 per cent, and the highest that in Maryland, 93 per cent In Massachusetts 37 per cent of the wage earners were under 16 years of age, and in Missouri 76 per cent -Comparison with previous censuses, for the United States as a whole,In order to compare the distri?ution of persons engaged in the industry accordmg to occupational status in 1909 with that in 1904 -it 1s necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (see Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 12 for the industry as a whole -Although there was an increase of 237 per cent in the average number of wage earners in the industry as a whole between 1904 and 1909, they constituted a smalle: proportion of the total number of persons engaged m the industry in 1909 than in 1904 There was an increase of 659 per cent in the number of salaried employees, but the number of proprietors antl firm members decreased -Table 13 shows the averaOe number of waOe earners in th? industry as a whole, dttributed accordhig to age, and ;n the case of those 16 years of age and over accordmg to sex, for 1909, 1904, and 1899 AJ,, already explained, the distribution for 1909 is estimated on the basis of the actual numbers reported for a single representative day (see Introduction) -Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 14 gives, for the industry as a whole, the number of wage earners employed on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909, for the 17 states in which at least 500 wage earners were employed on the average during the year -In the United States the largest number of wage earners employed in this industry during any month  of 1909 was 207,452, in December, and the smallest number 190,382, in May, the minimum number forming 918 per cent of the maximum number The industry is not subject to great fluctuations from month to month In 1904 March was the month of greatest employment, although the number for that month (163,598) was but little greater than the number for December (162,891) May was the month of least employment (154,961, or 947 per cent of the maximum) in 1904 The month of maximum employment in 1909 is shown to have been December in 9 of the 17 states listed, among which are 6 of the most important; in 2, California and New Hampshire, it was November, wl1ile in Connecticut the maximum number was reported for both November and March; and in 2, Illinois and Maine, it was February The months of minimum employment in most states occurred between January and July -1 The mouth of maxitnum employment for each state Is Indicated by boldface figures allll that of minimum employment hy lln!ic figures -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 15 are presented statistics for the wage earners in the industry as a whole, classified according to the prevailing hours of labor per week in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment is classified as a total, according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or a smaller number of hours -A majority (573 per cent) of the wage earners were employed in establishments in which the prevailing hours of employment were more than 54 but less than 60 per week, and 962 per cent were employed in establishments in which the prevailing hours of employment were either 54, between 54 and 60, or 60 per week Only 233 worked in establishments where the prevail:ing hours of employment were more than 60 per week, and only 7,272 were employed where the prevailing hours were less than 54 per week In every state -listed, except Marylnrnl, l\\\\fichigan, Virginia, und Wisconsin, the wage em∑ners in establishments working between M and GO hours per week greatly outnumbered those in any otlwr group

products of such estabhs ∑ ments, while for firm ownership there was an absolute decrease in both respects -NOTE,Tn some states, in ardor to avoid disclosing the returns for individual establishments, the fiblltes for ono group have been consolidated with thoso for establlsbmonts under another form of ownership, In such cases an (X) is placod in tho column from which the figures haye been omitted and the figures for tho group with which they havo been combined are printed in italics One establishment under cooperative ownership is included with those under firm ownership -There was a considerable variation among the states in the relative importance of the establishments operated by individuals, firms, and corporations, respectively, but, as measured by value of products, corporate ownership predominated to a greater or less degree in all of the 17 states for which statistics are shown In Massachusetts, the principal boot and shoe producing state, corporations in 1909 controlled -274 per cent of the establishments, gave employment to 667 per cent of the wage earners, and reported 637 per cent of the value of products In Missouri, however, in which the industry is relatively much younger, corporations controlled 864 per cent of the establishments, employed 982 per cent of the number of wage earners and reported 985 per cent of the value of products In New York corporations reported a smaller proportion (525 per cent) of the total value of products than in most other states, but the proportion for finn ownership was the largest shown, 364 per cent For individual ownership the proportion in New York was 111 per centeven lower than in Massachusetts -Classification according to value of productsTable 18, relating to the entire industry in the United States, presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for establishments grouped according to the value of their products -1,895 Although these establislunents represented a comparativelysmall proportion of the total number of establishments, they reported a large proportion of the value of products477 per cent in 1909 and 333 per cent in 1904 The large establishments thus gained materially in their proportion of the business, the other classes losing correspondingly, It should be noted, however, that this change may in part be the result merely of an advance in prices, by reason of which an establishment, without increasing the quantity of its output, might have passed from a lower class in to a higher -∑ The small establishmentsthat is, those manufacturing products valued at less than $20,000constituted about onethird (322 per cent) of the total number of establishments in 1909, but reported only 1 per cent of the total value of products -Classification according to ªumber of wage earnersIn some respects, and especially from the standpoint -?f conditions under which persons engaged in the mdustry work, tho best method of bringing out ti feature of size is a classillcation

branches of t,ho industry with respect to the distrib~tion of expenses For establishments engaged primarily in tho mnnufacturo of boots and shoes the proportions of the total expenses formed by the several classes were as follows: Materials, 672 per cent; wages, 224 per cent; salaries, 42 per cent; and miscellaneous, 62 per cont For establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of cut stock the proportions were: Materials, 883 por cont; wages, 75 per cent; salaries, 15 per cent; nnd miscellaneo~s, ~6 per cent For establishments engaged primarily m _the manufacture of findings the corresponding proportions were 79l por cont, 127 per cent, 3 per cent, and 5Z per cont, respectively -Necessarily there are variations among the several states in the distribution of expenses Table ZO shows the percentages formed by the several items of expense in 13 of the principal states, for 1909; the absolute n~mbcrs are shown in Table 28 The figures relate to all three branches of the industry combined, -For Kentucky, wages represented only 53 per cent of the total expenses, while miscellaneous expenses -formed a high proportion (124 per cent) In this state tho manufacture of boots and shoes is largely carried on in the penal institutions, and in such cases the amount paid for convict labor is reported as  contract work\" under \"miscellaneous expenses,\" and the employees are not shown in the census reports of manufactures as wage earners Similar conditions, although to a lesser extent, prevail in :Maryland Variations appear in other states, clue to differences in the relative importance of the three branches of the industry, in the amount of duplication in cost of materials, in the class of goods produced, in the kind of labor employed, and in other conditions -Table 21 shows the number of engines or othe1∑ motors, according to their character, employed in generating power (including electric motors operated by purchased current) and their total horsepower, as reported at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899 It also shows separately the number and horsepower of electric motors, including those operated by current generated in the establishments using them -The number and horsepower of electric motors used for distributing power by means of current generated in the establishments shov,s a very great increase during the decade -Table 22 shows for

statement of the number of pairs of the difforent kinds of boots, shoes, nnd slippers manufactured, ancl in 1909 classified nccording to method of m11nufacture Values were not called for in this connection in 1909 -Production, by kindsTable 23 shows tho number of pairs of the different kinds of footwoar niado in tho United States and in 13 of tho leading statos in 1909, 1904, and 1899, respectively In comparing these statistics it should bo noted th11,t tho specfol schedule for 1909 for the :first time called specifically for the output of infants shoes and slippers Tho number of pairs of such shoes and slippers reported in that yonr was 15,000,721 This number is not shown as a sepamte item in Table 23, nor included with any of the classes specified, but it is included in the total output of 285,017,181 pairs of boots, shoos, and slippers Similarly, the total for each state for 1909 includes the production of infonts shoes ancl slippers, but they are not included in the other columns It il probable that _at the censuses of 1904 and 1899 some infants shoes and slippers were reported under the heading misses and childrens boots and shoes,\" some under the heading \"womens, misses, and childrens slippers,\" and some under the heading \"all other kinds,\" while for some the value only may have been re1)orted It is impossible to distribute tho total number of infants shoes and slippers reported in 1909 among the three classes just mentionedand, indeed, thoy do not properly belong -to any of them For these reasons the statistics for misses and childrens shoos, for womens, misses, and childrens slippers, and for all other kinds,\" as shown in the table, are not closely comparable for the tln∑oe censuses -308 per cont For mens boots and shoes the increase botwoon 1899 nnd 1909 wns 88G por cent, and for womens boots and shoes 3:33 per cent, but for boys and youths boots and shoos it wns only 134 per cent AE already stated, tho data for t,ho other classes of products shown in tho tahlo nro scnrcoly comparable But for the exclusion of infants1 shoos and slippers at the census of 1909, tho classes of misses1 and children1s boots nnd shoes and womens, misses, and childrens slippers would probably have shown a considerablein∑ crease as compared with 1899 Tho figures for \"all other kinds\" probably nre the least comparable of all For example, it seems likely that the large pr~du~tion reported under this heading for Pennsylvama m 1904 (3,009,090 pairs) which was mnny times greater than that rc1)ortod in 1909 included largo numbers

cxtruoTdinary changes shown in the production of womens, misses, and childrens slippers in certain states are probably misleading, being clue to the :failure to distribute properly some of tho products reported for 1904 and 1899 and to the exclusion of infants shoes and slippers from the figures for 1909 -Table 24 shows tho total number of pairs of infants shoes and slippers manufactured in

sti,tistics for the industry, by states, for 1909, showing the number of establish-ments, number of persons engaged in the industry, primary horsepower, capital invested, expenses (so far as these were reported), value of products, and value added by manufacture -: ~xelud!ng staqstjcs for one establl~hment, to avoid disclosure of Individual operationsExcludmg stat1shcs for two establishments, to avoid disclosure or indlvldnal operations -Nature of the industryThe industry designated by the Bureau of the Census \"leather, tanned, curried, and finished,\" which for brevity may be called simply the leather industry, includes establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of leather from various kinds of hides and skins A great variety of different kinds of leather are produced, and for some kinds the processes are quite different from those for others The processes may, for the most part, be classified into the two main groups of tanning, on the one hand, and currying and finishing on the other The process of tanning is applied in producing all kinds of leather Most kinds of leather are subjected to finishing processes to render them more pliable, to give them the desired kind of surface, or to color them The hides of cattle are frequently split to make the leather thinner and more pliable and to increase the area obtained -In many establishments leather is both tanned and finished, but in some cases tho different processes are performed at different establishments One establishment may buy rough tanned leather from another establishment and curry or finish it To this extent there is a duplication in the cost of materials and in tho value of products shown for the industry as a whole, as the cost of materials and the value of products for each establishment are included in the respective totals In other cases one establishment may tan hides and skins, or may curry or finish leather, owned by another establishment in the leather industry, the work being performed under contract Under these conditions the value of products reported by the establishment performing the work is only the compensation received therefor, and not the value of the leather as turned out, which is reported by the establishment for which the work is done There is, -of course, some duplication in value of products under these conditions, but the full value of the products is not duplicated -Finally, there are a gootl many establishments which tan or curry and finish leather under contract for concems other than those engaged in the leather industry, particularly for dealers in leather In such cases also the value of products reported for the establishment performing the work represents only the compensation for work performed, and consequently the total value of products shown for the leather industry does not i11clude the entire value of leather so produced Separate statistics are given in this report, however, with respect to the number and estimated value of hitles and skins treated under contract for others thau tanners, curriers, and :finishers -rho large number of establishments reported for these two early censuses, ancl also for 1869 and 1879, is in part due to tho fact that at tho censuses prior to 1889 establishments engaged both in tanning and in currying and finishing made separate reports for oach branch of the industry, and thus wore counted twico -ropor~ed as tann~ri~s and 3,332 as engaged in the currymg  and fimshmg of leather Because of this method of handling the statistics from 1849 to 1879the combined value of products for tho two bran h of tho industry includes much duplication and\\\\;s figures are not co~pttrablc with those for iater cen~ susos  The same 1s true of tho datt1 given for cost of

thoso states for which :figures can not be shown In considering the rank in value of products, it, should bo borno in mind that there may be more duplication in value in some states than in others -Pennsylvania is by far the most important state in earners, value of products, and value added by manuthe manufacture of leather, ranking first at the cenfacture In 1909 the value of products for the s~at~ 3uses of 1909 and 1904 in average mnnber of wage represented 238 per cent of the total for the Urute -States The number of wage earners employed in the industry in Pennsylvania increased 46 per cent during the decade ending with 1909, and the value of products 401 per cent Wisconsin ranked second in 1909 in value of products and third in value added by manufacture, advancing from third place and fourth place, respectively, m 1904 Massachusetts ranked third in value of products in 1909, dropping from second place, which it held in 1904, but it ranked second at both censuses in number of wage earners and value added by manufacture According to value of products, New Jersey ranked fonrth in 1909, displacing New York, which held fourth place in 1904 -Of the 10 leading states in the leather industry (as determined by value of products), West Virginia showed the most rapid development during the period from 1899 to 1909, the number of wage earners increasing 1366 per cent and the value of products 2878 per cent Wisconsin, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Michigan, and Ohio also showed high percentages of mcrease in all three items given in the table, while New York lost in average number of wage earners engaged in the industry North Carolina, which, however, is not among the leading states in the industry, showed exceptionally large gains from_ 1899 to 1909, the number of wage earners increasing 1273 per cent and the value of products 2605 per cent -In general, the states held the same, or practically the same, rank in respect to value of products in 1909 as in 1904, showing that there was no very conspicuous change in the geographic distribution of the industry during the fiveyear period -The average number of wage earners for each state, as reported at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899, is given in Table 28 This table does not show the distribution of the average number by sex and age for the mdividual states, but Table 29 gives such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, 1909, or the nearest representative day Female wage earners were reported in 14 of the 25 states for which separate figures are shown The largest number of such wage earners, 821, was reported for the state of Delaware, and the next largest number, 743, for Pennsylvania Most of the children employed as wage earners were reported fr01;n Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin; the proportion of children was higher in Ncw Jersey than in any other state -In order to compare the distribution of persons engaged in the industry according to occupational status m 1909 with that in 1904, it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such u comparison is made in Table 4 -Table 5 shows the average number of wage earners engaged in the industry, distributed according to age periods, and in the case of those 16 years of age and over according to sex, for 1909, 1904, and 1899 The number of women employed has increased with each succeedina census but the number of children, though much lar:er in 1904 than in 1899, was materially less in 1909 than 10 years before -1 Tim month of rnaxlinnm

any month of 1909 was 66,694, in December, and the smallest number, 60,075, in May, the minimum number being equal to 901 per cent of the maximum In 9 of tho 14 states named the greatest activity in the industry occurred during December The increase toward the latter part of the year was probably duo, at least in part, to general improvement in industrial conditions In 1904 the maximum number for the industry as a whole was reported for March, and the minimum number, which was equal to 972 per cent of the maximum, was reported for January -The months of maximum and minimum employment for 1909 and the number of wage earners reported for these months are given for each state in Table 29 -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 7 the wage earners in the leather industry have been classified according to the hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they are employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment is classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or less number of hours Nearly ninetenths (895 per cent) of the wage earners employed in the industry in 1909 were in establishments where the prevailing number of hours of labor was more than 54 but not over 60 per week Ten hours a day is the common work~ng time, with a part holiday in some cases Seven per cent of the wage earners were employed in establishments where the usual hours were 54 per week, and only 35 per cent in establishments where the hours were less than 54 per week In the majority of the states for which separate figures are shown a larger number were employed in establishments where the prevailing hours of labor were 60 per week than were employed in the -establishments in any of tho other groups fo Massachusetts, however, 80!) per cent of the totol number of wage oamors roportocl for the state were employed in establishments oporating niore than 54 but less than 60 hours per wock, 11nd in Now Jersey 823 per cent were in such ostablishmonts -Character of ownershipTable 8 presents statistics with respect to tho character of ownership of establishï ments in the industry -The most important distinction is that between corporate and all other forms of ownership In 1909, of the total number of establishments reported for the industry, 494 per cent were under corporate ownership, as compared with 374 per cent in 1904 While corporations thus controlled less than onehalf of the total number of establishments in 1909, the value of the products of these establishments represented 763 per cent of the total value of products for all establishments engaged in the industry in that year The corresponding proportion in 1904 was decidedly lower, -Table 9 gives statistics with respect to form of ownership for each state for which an average of more than 500 wage earners were reported at the census of 1909 -There was considerable variation among the different states as to the relative importance of the establishments operated under the three forms of ownership Thus, in West Virginia, establishments controlled by corporations constituted 70 per cent of the total number of establishments, and gave employment to 954 per cent of the wage earners and reported 941 per cent of the value of products In Delaware, on the other hand, while corporations controlled 562 per cent of the establishments, these establishments gave employment to only 307 per cent of the wage earners and contributed but 311 per cent of the total value of products of the industry in the state, a few large establishments operated by firms doing the major part of the business -NOTEIn some states, In order to avoid disclosing the returns for individual establishments, tlJe figurns for one group have _been ronsnlidnted with those for est~bllshments nnder other forms of ownership In such cases an (X) is placed 1n the column from which

1904 according to the value of their products -tion of the business in 1909 than in 1904, but this may be due, at least in part, to the effect of advance in Prices causing certain establishments to advance from -On the other hand, the small establishments manufacturing products valued at less than $20,000 constituted 259 per cent of the total number of establishments in 1909, but the value of their products amounted to only onehalf of 1 per cent of the total -the :fiveyear period   Table 11 gives, for 1909, a class1ficat1on of the establishments according to the number of wage -earners and shows the average number of wage earners employed by establishments of each group for each of the 14 leading states -ExpensesAs stated in the Introduction, the census figures for expenses do not purport to reprosont the total cost of manufacture, since they take no account of depreciation, and consequently can not be used for determining profits Facts of interest can, however, be brought out concerning the relative importance of the different classes of expense which were reported Table 12 shows, in percentages, for the 12 states in which the reported expenses for 1909 amounted to more than $5,000,000, the distribution of these expenses among the classes indicated -105 per cont; saln,rios, $0,748,636, or 22 per cent; and miscellaneous exponsos, $18,57:3,097, or 61 per cent The comp11rativoly slight vaifations among the several states in tho proportions of tho different classes of expenses are duo largely to difforences in the extent to which custom tanning or finishing is done, since the cost of tho hides and Hkins t1tnnorl or finished for establishments not assigned to tho leather industry does not enter into tho cost of nu1torials reported Among the 12 principnl sttltes shown in Table 12 there was a varintion in tho proportion of the total expenses represented by cost of materiitls from 768 per cent in Mnssn,clrnsetts to 866 per cent in West Virginia, Engines and powerThe amount of power used in the industry was first reported at the census of 1869 Table 1 shows that tho total horsepower increased from 39,583 in 1869 to 14:8,140 in 1909 -Table 14 shows, for 1909, the amount of each of the several kinds of power and of the different kinds of fuel used in the industry in the 14 states for which statistics have been presented in previous tables -The largest amounts of power were reported for Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Wisconsin, New York, and New Jersey, the five leading states in the industry, as measured by the number of wage earners employed, the total for these states amounting to 97,291 horsepower, or 657 per cent of the total for the United States Steam power was the most important form of power in every state for which separate statistics are presented The largest amount of steam power, 33,079 horsepower, is sho\"\\\\\\\\\"11 for Pennsylvania, which state also reported the largest amount of power generated by gas and other internal combustion engines, 5,134 horsepower, or 71 per cent of the total for such power for the United States Rented electric power wns reported for all the states shown in the table except Virginia and West Virginia, but the largest amount, 1,286 horsepower, is shown for New York  -There has been a marked increase in the horsepower of gas and other internal combustion engines and of electric motors operated by purchased curreni The horsepower of electric motors operated by current -Fuel consumed in the industryClosely relnted to the subject of the kind of power employed is that of the fuel consumed in generating this power or otherwise used The amount expended for fuel and rent of power in the leather industry in 1909 was $3,292,831 This item is shown by states in Table 29 The amount of each kind of fuel consumed is shown in Table 14 Bituminous coal was the principal kind of fuel used, 1,028,215 tons being consumed in the in-dustry as a whole during 1909 Of anthracite coal, 98,724 tons were used, Pennsylvitnia, with 26,089 tons, and New York, with 25,327 tons, being the largest consumers Spent tanbark is utilized for fuel in many tanneries, and by some the amount so used was reported The larger proportion of the establishments, however, kept no account of it and were unable to make any estimate, so that the data reported have not been tabulated -The special schedule used in collecting the statistics £or the leather industry required a detailed report of the quantity and cost of the different kinds of purchased materials used during the year, tho number and estimated value of the hides or skins treated under contract for other establishments, and the qmintity and value of the different products nrnnufocturotl for sale This special schedule was used not only for establishments assigned to the leather industry itself, but also for establishments n,asigned to other industries which incidentally tanned, curried, or finished leather -Total number of hides and skins used by establishments in the leather industry and in other industriesTable 15 shows, for the United States as a whole, tho total number of hides ancl skins used in the manufacture of leather in 1909 and 1904, distinguishing those treated by establishments in tho industry from those treated by establishments assignocl to other industries, and distinguishing purchased hides and skins from those furnished by others The :figures given for hides and skins treated under contract represent only those treated for concerns not assigned to the leather industry, as hides and skins so treated for other ostiiblishments in the industry are reported by those establishments among their matorinls -204 per cent, were treated by such establishments under contract for other concerns not in the leather industry; and 447,435, or threetenths of 1 per cent were treated by establishments assigned to othe; industries, most of which used the leather produced in the manufacture of more highly :finished products Of the total number of hides and skins treated in 1909 cattle hides represented a little less than oneseventh and the skins of other animalschieflygoats,sheep, and

domestic nnimals in the United States -figures is approximately 6,750,000 Most of  difference is attributable to the use of imported hides, -There was a marked increase in the importations of 1909 as compared with previous years, particularly in the latter part of the year, but because of the interval of time elapsing between importation and treating in the tanneries it is doubtful whether the number of imported ~des treated during 1909 equaled the number imported during the year For the calendar year 1909 the total imports of cattle hides aggregated 279,114,262 pounds Returns from the slaughtering establishments in the United States indicate an average weight per hide in 1909 of about 53 pounds If the imported hides were of the same average weight the number of pounds imported in 1909 would be equivalent to about 5,266,000 hides The excess of the number of hides treated over the number reported as taken off plus the number imported may be attributable to various possible causes, such as incompleteness in the returns of hides taken off, reduction of stocks on hand, error due to the assumption that the imported hides have the same weight as the domestic, or minor errors in the returns of imports or of number treated -The number of skins other than cattle hides reported as taken off in theUnited States in 1909 was 19,900,483, or less than oneseventh as many as were treated It is impossible to calculate the number of skins imported, as statistics are given only for weight, and there is no means of determining the average weight with any approach to accuracy The number imported is, however, very great During the calendar year 1909 there were imported 115,547,176 pounds of goatskins, 63,587,930 pounds of sheepskins, and 114,793,137 pounds of skins of other animals (not including fur skins) ,1 the great bulk of the lastnamed item consisting of calfskins and horsehides -Purchased materials used in the leather industry proper,Table 17 shows in detail the quantity and cost of the various classes of purchased materials used in the leather industry in 1909, 1904, and 1899, together with the percentages of increase between 1899 and 1909 The number of hides and skins given does not include those treated under contract for establishments not in the leather industry, and none of the stn,tistics include data for establishments assigned to industries other than \"leather, tanned, curried, and finished\" which do their own tanning or finishing There is a comparatively small amount of duplication in the total cost of materials for the industry, due to the fact that some rough leather tanned by establishments in the industry is purchased for further treatment by other establishments in the industry -The cost of all materials reported increased 602 pei cent between 1899 and 1909 The number of purchased hides used increased 159 per cent, but the cost increased 535 per cent The difference between these two percentages is due chiefly to the increase in prices, -but it may be due in part to differences in the quality or character of the hides treated The number of skins of all kinds other than cattle hides increased 165 per cent between 1899 and 1909, and the cost increased -653 per cent Each separate class of skins shows a decidedly greater percentage of increase in cost than in numbera fact which again is attributable chiefly, though not necessarily exclusively, to increase m prices Approximately onehalf the cost of all materials at each census covered by the table was represented by that of cattle hides, the average value of which is much greater than that of the skins of other animals used in the industry Table 17 -Value of products of all establishments, including those not assigned to the leather industry,It is impossible to determine from the census returns the total value of leather produced in the United States because adequate data are not available with respect to the value of the leather made by establishments in the leather industry under contract for other establish ments not assigned to the industry It is true that establishments doing work under contract for others were required to give estimated values for the hides and skins treated, but to add up these figures would involve duplication, owing to the fact that in some cases one establishment tanned l1ides or skins under contract and another establishment curried and fin ished the same hides or skins under contract -Table 18 shows, for 1909 and 1904, the total value of products reported by establishments in the leather industry, together with the value of leather made by establishments in other industries The value of prod ucts for the leather industry itself represents that of products made for sale plus the receipts for custom work done for others, but does not include the value of the products of custom work done ior concerns not in the leather industry -The increase in the value of leather made by establishments in other industries between 1904 and 1900, as shown in this table, doubtless results in large pn,rt, as already indicated, from the more complete segregation of this braneh of the business of such 0stablishmcnts in 190D -Products of the leather industry properTable 19 shows in detail, for 190D, 1904, and 1899, tho qun,ntity and value of products of the establishments assigned

products tren,tecl by establishments in the industry under contract for others, but the receipts for contract work are shown It is possible that in some cases tho items for the several censuses may not be altogether cornparn,ble -The quantities of the several classes of products in most cases show a materially lower percentage of increase than the values, a fact which is ln,rgely, but not of necessity exclusively, due to the increase in the prices of the :finished products, which in turn is largely attributable to the increase in prices of materials already refe1Ted to The quantity of sole leather of al kinds combined increased 151 per cent and its value -592 per cent; the production of hemlock sole leather decreased, while that of the other classes increased materially It is doubtful, however, if the data fo chrome leather are entirely comparable Tho outpu of grain upper leather and of :finished splits decreased somewhat during the decade, but according to th returns that

establishments in the leather industry has no particular significance) as the value of the finished produets has ah∑eady been included in the total value of products for the leather industry, being reported in each case by the establishment for which the work was done On the other hand, the estimated value of the leather made from the hides and skins treated for establishments in other industries has not been included in the total value of products given elsewhere, because, as already stated, it is improper to add together the vahrns given for the several items, since the same hides or skins may be reported twice, once as tanned and ngain as curried and finished -Leather produced by establishments assigned to other industriesThe following table shows, for 1909, the quantities and

gauntlets, lined and unlined, whether for men, for women, or for children, and whether for dress purposes or for work From 1869 to 1899, inclusive, the classification was gloves and mittens,\" and included establishments making gloves and mittens of materials other than leather, except knit gloves and mittens and rubber gloves and mittens Fur gloves and mittens were excluded by defmite instructions in 1904 and 1909 The extent to which the manufacture of fur gloves was included at prior censuses, while uncertain, -was undoubtedly small, as they are usually made by establishments making also fur goods of other classes It is not believed that the data for the censuses prior to 1904 were sufficiently affected by the inclusion of establishments which have since been excluded to impair seriously their comparability with the figures for the later censuses -The financial figures for 1869 are given in currency, which at that time was worth only about 80 cents, gold, to the dollar For strict comparison, therefore, these figures should be reduced about 20 per cent -1 A minus sign () denotes decrease Where percentages aro omitted comparablo :figures are not avnilable -Substantial :increases in value of products occurred during each decade covered by the table The value of products reported for 1909 was nearly six times the value for 1869, but a part of the increase is due to the advance in prices during the 40 years From 1899 to 1909 the value of products increased $6,704,442, or 396 per cent According to tl1e returns there was during the decade a decided decrease in the number of wage earners, accompanied by an increase in the amount paid for contract work from $93,795 in 1899 to $992,216 in 1909 The :figures reported, however, are misleading, owing to a change in the method of reporting the piecework done for the glove factories at the individual homes, a practice very widely prevalent in New York In 1899 these pieceworkers were reported as wage earners and their earnings included with wages By reason of the impossibility of ascertaining accurately the number of persons engaged in glove making at their homes or the time given to such

much more important in Gloversville than in Johnstowu, and the increase in value of products during the decade in Gloversville, 367 per cent, was greater than that in Johnstown, 265 per cent The decrease shown in the average number of wage earners in Fulton County and in each of the two cities, and the great increase in miscellaneous expenses, is, as already explained, due to the differeJ1ce in the method of reporting piecework done in the homes of the workers -Persons engaged in the industryTable 4 shows, for 1900, the number of persons engaged in the industry, classified according to

tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction Moreover, as already stated, the data do not cover pieceworkers working in their own homes -The average number of wage earners for each state, as reported at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1890, is given in Table 18 The average number distributed by sex and age is not shown for the individual states, but Table 19

1909 -Table 11 gives a classification of the establishments in the industry according to the average number of wage earners employed for the four states for which more than 500 wage earners were reported at the census of 1909 -ExpensesAs stated in the Introduction, the census figures for expenses do not purport to represent the total cost of manufacture, since they take no t1ccount of interest or depreciation, and consequently can not be used for determining profits Facts of interest cnn, however, be brought out concerning the relative importance of the different classes of expenses which were reported Table 1 shows the totalexpenses to have been $21,244,895, divided as follows: Materials, $13,208,001, or 622 per cent; wages, $4,763,830, or 224 per cent; salaries, $1,256,042, or 59 per cent; and miscellaneous expenses, $2,017,022, or 95 per cent The variations in the proportions represented by the respective classes in the several states, as shown by Table 19, are due largely to differences in the grades of gloves and mittens manufactured; to the fact that, although gloves and mittens were the chief products of all establishments in the industry, fur garments, etc, were also manufactured in some of the establishments; and to the practice in some states of doing much of the work on the gloves and mittens manufactured outsidCI the factories, the payments for such work being included with the payments for \"contract work\" under miscellaneous expenses, and not under wages -ter, employed in generating power (including electric motors operntetl

industry: 1909,Table 1 presents a summary of the statistics for the paper and wood pulp industry as a whole for 1909 It distinguishes three classes of mills: (1) Mills making paper exclusively; -(2) mills making wood pulp exclusively; and (3) mills which manufacture both pulp and paper The pulp manufacturnd by the mills which produce both pulp and paper is largely made into paper iii the establishments whore produced Since a large part of the business is done by mills which combine the two branches, the statistics for those three classes of mills separately have no great significance, and hence in all the tables except Table 1 only figures for the three classes of mills combined are presented It is obvious, however that the combined value of products and the combined cost of materials involve much duplication, amounting to approximately $30,000,000, this being about the value reported for wood pulp manufactured for sale or for use in establishments other than the ones where it was produced The statistics here given do not cover tho cutting or transportation of timber or pulp wood, which is often done by concerns engaged in the industry, except that the expenses connected with the produ?tion of th?se materials by such establishments are mcluded with the cost of materials -these establishments contributed products valued at $129,381,198, or 483 per cent of the total value of products reported for the industry as 11 whole  The 81 establishments manufacturing pulp exclusively formed slightly more than onetenth of the total number, and the value of their products represented about onetwelfth of the total value of products The 158 establishments making both pulp and paper formed 203 per cent of the total number in the industry as a whole and reported 436 per cent of the total value of products This group includes a number of combination pulp mills and paper mills operated as separate units but under the same ownership In some of these case:, the mills manufacturing pulp sold a certain part of their product, and in others the pulp was all used in the paper mill owned by the same company In all, there were 82 mills of this character of which 37 manuf acturecl paper alone and 45 made pulp alone The companies owning these mills made combined reports covering both branches of the industry, and the 82 rnills were counted as 34 -1 A minus sign ()

ranked third in each respect, Of the 8 states which reported products vnlued at $10,000,000 or over, Michigan shows the most rapid development in the industry during the period from 1899 to 1909, the number of wage earners in this state increasing 2056 per cent and the value of products -2301 per cent Still higher percentages of increase are shown for West Virginia and Virginia, in which states, however, the industry was of less importance, even in 1909 In general the states held the same or nearly the same rank with respect to value of products in 1909 as in 1904, and most of the states had the same, or practically the same, rank in vnlue added by manufacture in 1909 as in value of products -Summary: 1909,Table 4 shows for 1909 the number of persons engaged in the industry, classified according to occupational status and sex, and in the case of wage earners, according to age also It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other∑ tables is an estimate obto,ined by the method described in the Introduction -The average number of wage earners in each state for 1909, 1904, and 1899 is given in Table 25 The average number distributed by sex and age is not shown for the individual states, but Table 26 gives such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, or the nearest representative day Female wage earners were reported as employed in 26 states, the largest number, 4,618, being reported for Massachusetts, and the next lnrgest number, 961, for Wisconsin The number of wage earners under 16 years of age employed in Massachusetts was 132, or practically half of the total for all states -In order to compare the distribution of the persons engaged in the industry in 1909 according to occupational status with that in 1904 it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 5 -Table 6 shows the average number of wage earners in the industry as a ,vhole distributed according to age, and in the case of those 16 years of age or over, according to sex, for HJ09, 1904, and 1899 The number of children employed was so small that the increase from 1899 to 1909 has little significance -Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 7 gives the number of wage earners employed in the industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 for 20 of the leading states in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed during the year -lThe month of maximum omploymont for

for both months, are given for a larger number of states in Table 26 -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 8 the wage earners in the industry as a whole have been classified according to the number of

greater part of the power used in the manufacture of paper and wood pt~lp, although such power represented a srna~ler proportion of the total primary power in 1909 than m1~04 So~e part of this decrease is due to the great mcrease m rented electric power much of which represents water -power transformed into electnca energy b th also an increase in the relative importance of ~ steam engines and gas and other internalcombust10n -Fuel consumedOwing to the extensive use of water power in the paper and wood pulp industry, less fuel is consumed in generating power than would otherwise be required Bituminous coal was the principal class of fuel used in 1909 The largest amount was reported by New York, which state also used the largest amount of anthracite coal Of the total amount of gas used, 706 per cent was reported for Ohio -Pulp wood used,Unlike the schedules used in 1904 and 1899, the schedule used in collecting data at the census of 1909 did not provide for reporting the kind or quantity of pulp wood used in the manufacture of pulp Such data for 1909 were collected, however, by the Census Bureau in collaboration with the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture, and the :figures secured are shoWn in Table 16 in comparison with the census figures for 1904 and 1899 -1 The figures represent the wood used by all mills manufacturing wood pulp, which

1-Summary for the industry: 1909According to the census classification the printing and publishing industry is made up of six branches, comprising establishDJents classified as follows: (1) Establishments whose chief business is book and job printing, book printing and publishing, or book publishing only; (2) establishments whose sole business is music printing, or whose chief business is music printing and publishing, or music publishing only; (3) establishments which are engaged in the printing and publishing, or in the publishing only, of newspapers and periodicals; (4) establishments whose chief business is bookbinding and blankbook making; (5) establishments whose chief business is engraving 011 steel plates and copper plates aJ1d printing from such plates; and (6) establishments whose chief business is lithographing -The first group is composed of establishments whose chief business is either one or both of the following: -(a) the publication of books, whether or not the publishing establishment does its own printing; and (b) \"job\" or \"contract\" printing, of any or every character, including the printing of books and of music; establishments engaged exclusively in the printing of music, however, are included in the second group -The essential characteristic of establishments in the third branch is the publication of newspapers or periodicals, the question of whether or not a given establishment of this class does its own printing being immaterial It should be noted that this branch includes every establishment which publishes a newspaper or periodical, regardless of the re1ative importance of the other departments or branches, if any, of its business -Because of the overlapping of the different branches of the industry as distinguished in this report, comparisons between them would be in some respects misleading Hence, certain of the tables do not contain separate figules for the different branches, but only totals for all establishments in all the branches combined -The total value of products for the industry as a whole, which in 1909 was $737,876,087, involves considerable duplication, due to the fact that establishments in one branch of the industry frequentlydo worldor establishments in another branch Moreover, there is duplication within certain of the individual branches of the industry, the bookpublishing and jobprinting branch being a conspicuous example Many book publishers do no printing, but hire their work done by jobprinting establishments, which are in-eluded in the same branch of the industry, while other concerns perform the presswork themselves but hire composition done Again, in the newspaper and periodical branch of the industry, certain concerns which print their own publications also print newspapers or periodicals published by others -In most industries where there is duplication in the value of products reported there is also extensive duplication in the cost of materials, but the latter form of duplication is relatively unimportant in the print-ing and publishing industry, as the payments made by establishments grouped therein to other establishments similarly classified are not for materials chiefly, but for contract work In most industries the subtraction of the cost of materials from the total value of products leaves an amount designated as \"value added by manufacture\" which is exclusive of all, or practically all, duplication In the case of the printing and publishing industry, however, this \"value added by manufacture involves very considerable duplication due to contract work done by one establishment for another The total amount reported as pai<l for this contract work in 1909 was $36,384,359 Practic11lly all of this was paid to other establishments in the industry If this amount be deducted from the total value of products, $737,876,087, there remains, in round numbers, $700,000,000, which, with a further slight deduction for duplication due to the sale of products by one establishment to another, would represent approximately the net value of products of the industry -lishing of newspapers and periodicals These establishments employed 108,672 wage earners, or 42 per cent of the total for the industry, and reported products to the value of $406,090,122, or 55 per cent of the total value of products reported for the industry as a whole A large proportion of the \"value of products\" of this branch of the industry represents payments received for advertising -Establishments engaged chiefly in book publishing or in job printing, or both, formed 341 per cent of the total number of establishments, reported 34 per cent of the total value of products, and employed 421 per cent of the total number of wage earners The 178 establishments engaged solely or chiefly in music publishing contributed only threefourths of 1 per cent of the total value of all products lhe other branches of the industry reported the following proportions of the total value of products: Bookbinding and blankbook making, 43 per cent; steel and copperplate engraving and plate printing, 13percent; and lithographing, 46 per cent The significance of these percentages is, of course, dependent on the extent of the duplication, not only in the total value of products of the industry, but also within the different branches of it -Comparison with earlier censusesComparable statistics for the industry as a whole are not available for censuses prior to 1889 Statistics for book and job printing and publishing were :first reported separately in 1869, when there were 960 establishments, employing a total of 17,613 wage earners, and reporting products valued at $41,075,971 Statistics for music printing and publishing were first shown separately at the census of 1859, only two establishments being reported; the industry was next reported separately at the census of 1889 Statistics for the printing and publishing of newspapers and periodicals were first shown separately at the census of 1869, in which year the returns showed 1,199 establishments, employing a total of 13,130 wage earners, and reporting products valued at $25,393,029 There was a special report on newspapers and periodicals at the census of 1879, but the statistics gathered were not sufficiently comprehensive for use in comparison ∑with those of -Table 3 summarizes the statistics for the printing and publishing industry as a whole, for each census from 1889 to 1909, inclusive -Notwithstanding certain elements of possible incomparability in the :figures, it is evident that there was a much more rapid development in the industry from 1899 to 1909 than <luring the preceding decade During the more recent period the number of salaried employees more than doubled, the number of wage earners increased almost onethird, and the value of products increased nearly seveneighths -The publishing of newspapers and periodicals, the largest of the sbc branches of the industry, showed marked increases during the decade 18991909 in all respects except in average number of wage earners The comparatively small gain in this particular is due to the increased use of typesetting and typecasting machines; it is worthy of note that notwithstanding the small increase in number of wage earners the -The industry as a

to compnre the distribution of the persons engaged in the industry in 1909 according to occupational status with that in 1904, it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census, (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made for the industry as a whole in Table 13 -1 The month of maximum employment for each state is indicated by boldface figures and that of minimum employment by italic figures -The largest number of wage earners employed during any month of 1909 was 269,884, in December, and the smallest number 251,757, in July, the minimum number being equal to 933 per cent of the maximum In 1904 also the maximum number (228,441) and the minimum (212,067) were reported for December and July, respectively, the minimum number in that year being equal to 928 per cent of the maximum In 32 of the states, including all of the important ones in the industry, the month of maximum employment was the same as that for the country as a whole (December); but there was considerable variation as to tho month of minimum employment, only 12 states reporting July, the month returned by the country as a whole New York and Ohio reported thefr minimum number of wage earners for July, Illinois for June, and Massachusetts and Pennsylvania for August -and job printing, and newspaper and periodical printing and publishing, the months of maximum and of minimum employment were the same, but the variations were much more pronounced in the :first named branch -The montl1s of maximum and minimum employment for 1909, and the number of wage earners reported for these months, are given for each state in Table 67 -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 16 the wage earners in the industry as a whole have been classified according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification tho average numbei∑ of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or a smaller number of hours -More than onehalf (537 per cent) of the wage earners employed in the industry as a whole in 1909 were in establishments where the prevailing hours were 48 or less per week, 418 per∑ cent were employed in establishments where the prevailing hours were between 48 and 60, and less than threetenths of 1 per cent were employed in establishments where the prevailing hours were over 60 In all but 6 of the states for which separate data are shown, 48 hours or less per week constituted the most common time of employment The exceptions were Minnesota, where the prevailing hours were between 48 and 54; Maine, South Dakota, Vermont, and V:irginia, where they were 54; and New Hampshire, where they were between 54 and 60 -Jable 17 presents statistics with respect to the character of ownership of establishments in∑ the printing and publishing industry as a whole

of ownership other than individual firm, or corporate, 38 were controlled by cooperative associations  Five of these belonged to the book and job nrinting branch of the industry and 33 to the newspaper and periodical branch Of the remaining 1,008 establishments under miscellaneous or unclassified forms of owJtership, 60 were classed under \"book and job printing,\" 947 under \"newspapers and periodicals,\" and 1 under \"bookbinding and blankbook making\" Most of these establishments are owned by various educational, religious, commercial, fraternal, and other similar organizations The single \"bookbinding and blankbook making\" establishment under -\"other\" form of ownership was the bindery owned by Middlesex County, Mass, which binds books exclusively for the office of the register of deeds and other county offices -Table 18 gives statistics for establishments classified according to form of ownership for the 42 states and the District of Columbia employing an average of more than 500 wage earners in 1909 The 1,046 establishments under \"other\" forms of ownership have :in this table been included with those under corporate ownership -There was considerable variation among the states in the relative importance of the establishments under the three different forms of ownership Thus, in New York, the leading state in the industry, establishments controlled by corporations constituted 332 per cent of the total number of establishments, gave employment to 724 per cent of the wage earners, and reported -754 per cent of the total value of products In :Mississippi, on the other hand, corporations controlled only 129 per cent of the establishments, and these establishments gave employment to but 197 per cent of the wage earners, and contributed only 247 pel cent of the total value of products \\x0cPRINTING AND PUBLISHING -Olassiflcation by value of productsTable 19 presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for establishments in the industry as a

entire number of establishments in the industry in 1909, but the value of their products amounted to -only 181 per cent of the total More than half (526 per cent) of the establishments reported a production -Table 20 gives for each branch of the industry tho average number of wage earners, value of products, and value added by manufacture per establishment, in 1909 Lithographing leads in these averages by _a large margin, the printing and publishing of music following in value of products and value added by manufacture -Classification by number of wage earners,Table 21 classifies the establishments in 42 states and the District of Columbia according to the number of wage earners employed -241 per cent This latter item includes rent payments amounting to $13,648,406; taxes, $2,699,575; and payments for contract work, $36,384,359 The remainder, besides covering advertising expenses, traveling expenses, repairs, insurance, etc, includes various special i toms peculiar to the publishing industry, such as royalties t1nd other payments to authors and contributors, and costs of news service It is because of these special items that the proportion for miscellaneous expenses is higher in this industry than in most other industries Salaries, in this industry, represented a larger proportion of total expenses than in any other of the 43 industries of the country reporting products to the value of $100,000,000 or more, and the proportion represented by materials was smaller than in any other of these industries with the exception of distilled liquors and malt liquors The percentages of the total reported expenses represented by the several classes are shown for each of the six: branches of the industry in Table 22 -The high percentage represented by miscellaneous expenses in establishments engaged in the music printing and publishing branch of the industry is presumably due to the fact that royalty payments and payments for contract work form a larger proportion of the total payments than in the other branches The proportion for miscellaneous expenses shown for establishments engaged in printing and publishing newspapers and periodicals was also high for the reason already stated in the case of establishments in the music printing and publishing branch of the industry -Naturally there are variations among the several states in the distribution of expenses Table 23 shows the percentages formed by the several items of expense for 14 of the principal states for 1909; the absolute amounts are shown in Table 67 The figures relate to all sh: branches of the industry combined -For New Jersey, miscellaneous expenses represented only 14 per cent, of the total expenses, the lowest proportion shown by any state for which figures are given, while wages formed a higher proportion than in any other state In this state the bookbinding and blankbook making, engraving, and lithographing branches of the industry are of relatively greater consequence than in some of the other states, and in these branches miscellaneous expenses are relatively small and wage payments relatively large For New York, where the publishing business is particularly importlmt, the proportion represented by miscellaneous expenses was exceptionally large, owing to payments for contract work and other expenses peculiar to the publishing business -Printing and publishing is one of the few important industries in which rented electric current is used to a greater extent than steam as a source of power and this condition arose during the decade 189919091ï In 1899 i;Jteam power predominated with a total of 54 723 horsepower, but its gain for the decade was onl; 83 per cent On the other hand, the amount of rented electric power in 1899 was only 33,582 horsepower, but this power increased 1248 per cent during the following five years, surpassing steam power in amount in 1904 During the next five years such power increased 1619 per cont, the total horsepower in 1909 being 197,692, and constituting practically twothirds of all the primary power reported for the industry There was also a decided increase during the decade in the number and horsepower of electric motors operated by current generated in the same establishment -Table 25 shows, for 1909, the amount of the several kinds of power and of tho different kinds of fuel used in the industry as a whole in 42 states and the District of Columbia -Electricity constituted the most important source of primary power in all but five of the states given in the tableRhode Island and

Pennsylvania, however, consumed much larger quantities of anthracite than of bituminous coal Considerable quantities of oil and natural gas were used in some states The greatest quantities of gas were reported by Pennsylvania, New York, and Ohio, in the order named, the total for these states amounting to 868,491,000 feet, or 532 per cent of the total for the United States -of orders: Job printing ï ∑ ïï _ Ilookbind!ng aud blank books ∑∑∑∑ Electrotyping, engraving, aud litbo-While the Bureau of the Census recognizes six branches in the printing and publishing industry, the -business of actual publishing is restricted to three of these, namely, book publishing and job printing, music printing and publishing, and newspapers and periodicals In each of these branches, the receipts from publications constitute an important share of the value of products; and, naturally, their aggregate value of products represents by far the larger part (898 per cent) of the value of products of the industry as a whole These three branches, then, may be called the printing and publishing industry proper, and at the census of 1909 a supplemental schedule calling for more detailed information than at the two preceding censuses was used in the enumeration of establishments included in these branches  With the exception of Tables 66 and 67 (in which are presented detailed statistics by states for the industry as a whole) the remainder of this bulletin is devoted to the presentation of special statistics secured by this supplemental schedule -Table 27 shows, by states and geographic divisions, statistics for the value of the several classes of products or receipts of the three branches of book and job printing, printing and publishing of music, and newspapers and periodicals, for 1909 It should be distinctly understood that, for some of the classes of products, large amounts were reported by other branches of the industry not included in the table -lhe geographic divisions leading in 1909 in receipts from subscriptions and sales of newspapers and from newspaper advertising also, were the Middle Atlantic, the East North Central, and the West North Central, in the order named The states leading in receipts for newspaper advertising were New York, Pennsylvania, and Illinois; but Illinois exceeded Pennsylvania in receipts for subscriptions and sales, New York being :first -In receipts for subscriptions and sales of periodicals other than newspapers, the M:iddle Atlantic division ranked first, followed by the East North Central and New England divisions In receipts for periodical advertising, however, the West North Central outranked the New England division Among the individual states New York was first in receipts for subscriptions and sales, Pennsylvania second, and Illinois third; in receipts for advertising Illinois displaced Pennsylvania by a slight margin -In amount received for books and pamphlets, published or printed and published, the Middle Atlantic division was first, the East North Central division second, and New England third Ncw York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts were the leading states in value of output of these products -!h~ Middle Atlantic division led in rec~ipts from job prmtmg, the East North Central followmg, with the West North Central third New York, Illinois, and Pennsylvania were the leading states in the order named Under the heading \"job printing, not elsewhere included\" the statistics for book publishing and contract printing include separate reports for the printing departments of certain large mercantile establishments and of manufacturing concerns engaged primarily in industries other than printing and publishing Such establishments conduct their printing departments as adjuncts to their regular business and not as a source of direct profit -Table 28 shows, by states, statistics for the several classes of products of book publishing and job printing establishments for 1909 Such statistics are not available for censuses previous to 1909 -The printing and publishmg, and the publishing only, of books and pamphlets contributed 177 per cent of the total value of all products of this; branch of the industry Over twofilths of this value was reported from New York -In 1909, as at previous censuses, there was a lorge duplication of values in book and pamphlet publica~ions, since establishments doing publishing only were mcluded as well as those engaged in job printing Thus, the value of the same work frequently forms a part ~f the value of products of both the publishing establishment and of the concern doing the printing -Table 29 shows the principal statistics for each of the four subbranches of this part of the industry for 1909 -Table 30 shows statistics relative to character and number of books and pamphlets published for 1909 Comparative statistics are not available for p_revious -It will be noted that the number of copies of works on educational topics was nearly equal to the number reported as fiction Works on theology and religion ranked third -The census of 1909 was the first at which products of establishments publishing music books and sheet music were segregated Table 31 shows, by states, the statistics relative to the printing and publishing of music, for 1909 -The establishments doing publishing only were much more numerous than those which printed their o_wn publications Table 32 shows the general statistics for each class of establishments -ï Excludes music \"printed for publication by others\" and \"all other products,\" to avoid disclosure of Individual operations -Products and receiptsTable 33 shows the extent to which publishers of newspapers and periodicals engaged in other branches of the printing and publishing industry in 1909, 1904, and 1899 -The receipts from the printing and publishing of newspapers and periodicals increased 92 per cent during the decade 18991909, and constituted at the end of that period 831 per cent of the total value of products reported by this branch of the printing and publishing industry The larger part of these receipts, as well as the greater portion of the increase for the decade, was from advertising -At the censuses prior to 1909 there was no segregation of the various receipts from printing for others from those for printing in general, and for this reason some of the sheet music and books of music so printed, as well as some books and pamphlets, may have been accounted for in 1904 and 1899 under \"job printing not elsewhere included,\" or under \"all other products and work\" The item \"job printing, not elsewhere included\" is largely made up of receipts for printing newspapers, books, etc, for publication by others, though more of such work is done by establishments in the jobprinting branch of the industry than by those in the newspaper and periodical branch It is probable that the increase in \"job printing, not elsewhere included,\" was even larger than indicated because the manufacture of engravings, lithographs, ready prints, and stereotype plates for sale, shown separately for 1909, was included with the job printing just mentioned, at the census of 1899 -Receipts from book and job printing for others constituted, in 1909, 153 per cent of tJ1e entire receipts of establishments in this branch 0£ the industry This item showed a marked absolute increase in 1909 over 1899, although it constituted a smaller proportion of the total receipts in the later census year -Table 34 shows statistics for 1909 for newspaper publishing establishments that do no printing and for those that do both printing and publishing -Table 34 Wage ESTABLIS!Il!ENTS DOIN<lNumber of establishments earnera (averagenumï Wages Cost of materials

establishments in this branch of the industry and reported only -162 per cent of the total value of products reported lable 35 shows the ratio of cost of materials waaes  0  -salaries, miscellaneous expense, and value added by manufacture to value of products in 1909 for each of the two classes of establishmentsnewspapers and periodicals -Since the cost of contract work is reported under \"miscellaneous expenses,\" it is natural that this item -should be unusually large in proportion to the other items in the reports of the publishers wh<;> did no printing, and that the returns of such establishments for wages and for cost of materials should be correspondingly small -There was an increase of 13 per cent from 1904 to 1909 in the total number of newspapers and periodicals in the entire country In the New England and East North Central divisions, however, there was a considerable decrease, clue to a falling off in every state in these two divisions, with the exception of Connecticut -Besides the states in these divisions, the following 10 states in other divisions reported a less number for 1909 than for 1904: New Jersey, Mlnnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Maryland, West Virginia, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas -The greatest absolute increase reported for any class was that in number of publications devoted to news, politics, and family reading, but the highest percent-age of increase was in publications devoted to science and mechanics, with college and school periodicals second Several classes of publications decreased in number, the largest absolute decrease being in those classed as \"miscellaneous\" -New York leads in number of publications in the interest of commerce, finance, insurance, railroads, and of trade journals; and in such as are devoted to general literature, education and history, medicine and surgery, science and mechanics, and to society, art, music, and fashion Illinois is first in number of publications classed under \"news, politics, and family reading\"; \"agricultural, horticultural, dairy, stock raising, etc,\" \"law,\" and \"fraternal\" Pennsylvania leads in religious publications, and in college and school periodicals -Classification according to languageTable 39 shows the number of publications in English and in several of the foreign languages for 1909 and 1904, and the percentages of increase

seventenths of 1 per cent, as compared with 118 per cent The percentage of increase was greatest (558 per cent) for publications in Italian, and that for those in LottoSlavic came next with 32 per cent -Publications in French and German decreased in number These statements, however, are not to be taken as necessarHy conveying any idea of increase or decrease in circulation, for fewer publications at one census may show a greater circulation than a larger number of publications at another census -Circulation of newspapers and periodicals in generalIn all ti1bles where average circulation is shown, the figures are for the average circulation per issue as reported to the Bureau of the Census -At censuses prior to 1909 the Sunday newspapers and periodicals were not shown separately in the reports, but were treated as editions of dailies if published by daily newspapers, or as weeklies if published by concerns publishing no other newspaper At the census of 1009 these Sunday newspapers and periodicals were tabulated separately In tables showing number and circulation of all classes of publications, 1009 and 1904 only, the 1904 figures for circulation of dailynumber

each class for the 10 years 1899 to 1909 and for each :fiveyear period -The circulation of the daily and of the monthly publications increased during the decade in about the same proportions, 613 per cent and 671 per cent, respectively That of the triweekly, weekly, and quarterly publications increased considerably, while that of semiweeklies and \"all other classes\" decreased -A great increase in the circulation of the quarterlies, as shown by Table 42, took place between 1904 and 1909, and in that of monthly publications, between 1899 and 1904 The decrease in the circulation of the latter class between 1904 and 1909 was clue largely to the discontinuance in the state of Maine of several publications of low subscription rates which had reported a very large combined circulation -quarterly, and at various infrequent intervals from three to ten times a year, semiannually and annually From 1899 to 1904, however, there was a great decrease in the circulation of such publications -Circulation per 1,000 literate populationTable 43 shows the circulation of the newspapers and periodicals classified according to period of issue, the average circulation per issue and the average circulation per 1,000 literate persons 10 years of age and over being given for 1909 and 1899 for each class -The decrease in average circulation of weekly publications per 1,000 literate population was confined to newspapers, the circulation of weeklies other than newspapers showing an increase during the decade (See discussion under \"weeklies,\" p ) The daily newspapers and the monthly publications showed large increases in circulation per 1,000 literate population, the increases being 264 per cent for the daily and 309 per cent for the monthly publications -Period of issueTable 44

by the same plant are counted as two papers lhere are a few daily publications that do not contain the general -news In 1909, 23 such publications were reported, including 15 college dailies, 3 financial guides or financial news reports, 1 agricultural paper, a furniture trade journal, a law publication, a religious journal (Bohemian), and a summer hotel paper Statistics for these are included in the tables, but their aggregate circulation is insignificant -The increase during the decade in the total number of daily newspapers in the United States was 374, or -168 per centevery

avoid disclosures of the reported circulation of certain newspapers, the statistics for a few of the states have been combined -Over onethird of the total circulation for the ∑ United States in 1909 was reported by the states of the Middle Atlantic division, and considerable over onefifth by those of the East North Central division -Among the individual states New Y:ork led with over onefifth of the total circulation of the country, Pennsylvania following with a little more than oneeighth, and Illinois with about onetenth Massachusetts, Missouri, Ohio, and California were the only remaining states having over 3 per cent of the total circulation -lhe greatest absolute increase in the total circulation of dailies reported by any division was l,21G,814, reported by the Middle Atlantic division, and the least, 190,864, by the East South Central The greatest percentage of increase (533 ∑ per cent) is shown for the Mountain division, and the least (164 per cent) for the Middle Atlantic -In 1909 the circulation of the evening exceeded that of the morning publications in eight of the nine geographic divisions In only two of thesethe New England and the South Atlanticwas the relative increase greater than in 1904 The Mountain division is the only one of the divisions in which the morning circulation was greater than the evening, a reversal of conditions as reported for that division for 1904 On the other hand, the Pacific division, in which the morning circulation was the larger in 1904, reported the evening circulation as the larger in 1909 -Maine among the New England states and Missouri among the West North Central states reported in 1909 a larger morning than evening circulation, as -did also 11 other states in other divisions In most of these states, however, the evening circulation exceeded the morning in 1904 -The circulation of daily newspapers and periodicals printccl in these 10 cities constitu tcd 47 per cent of the total daily circulation of the entire country in 1909, as against 505 per cent in 1904 This change shows that the circulation of dailies published outside of the great centers of population has been increasing during the past few years more mpidly than that of papers in those centers The circulation of the daily newspapers published in Ncw York City constituted 169 per cent of the total for all dailies in the country in 1909, as compared ∑with 183 per cent in 1904 -Table 48 shows the circulation of morning and evening dailies in nine of the cities for 1909 and 1904 The statistics for Buffalo must be omitted to avoid disclosing the circulation of individual pnpers -The preponderance of the evening circulation was not only maintained from 1904 to 1909, but increased in New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, and Cleveland; and that of the morning, but with decreasing proportions, in Baltimore and San Francisco At the census of 1909 St Louis had, as reported, a larger circulation of evening dailies than of morning; this condition was reversed in 1904 The morning circulation of Pittsburgh dailies was reported as superior in size to the evening for 1904; at tho census of 1909 the figures showed that the evening circulation was the forger -LanguageTable 49 shows the number and circulation of daily newspapers and periodicals in English and in languages other than English for 1909 and 1904 -The percentage of increase in the circulation of newspapers in foreign languages was more than double that of publications in English -Table 50 shows the number and circulation, by states, of the dailies published in languages other than English in 1909 and 1904 -More than half of the circulation of dailies printed in foreign languages in 1909 was of publications issne<l in New York, which state also showed the greatest gain in circulation of any state between 1904 and 1909 A slight loss in the circulation of such papers -The German dailies led in number in 1909, but with a decrease of 10 as compared with 1904 New York was fast and Illinois next in the number of such dailies, a reversal of the conditions in this respect existing at the earlier census Yiddish dailies were second in number and Italian dailies third Ncw York reported more dailies in these languages than any other state, and also the only Arabic daily, the only Croatian daily, and the only Greek daily reported But one Finnish and one Slovak daily were reported, the former from Michigan and the latter from Pennsylvania The three Chinese dailies were all published in California, while of the three Spanish dailies Texas reported two and Florida one -Table 52 shows the average daily number of copies of the publications in each language so far as this can be shown without disclosure of the circulation of individual papers for 1909 and 1904 -In 1909 German dailies had over twofifths of the total circulation of dailies in foreign languages and the Yiddish followed with nearly onethird The greatest percentages of increase (each over 150 per cent) were for Yiddish, Japanese, and Hungarian publications The greatest circulation of Bohemian publications was reported by concerns in Illinois, of French publications, in Massachusetts, and of those in German, Hungariru1, Italian, and Yiddish, in New York -Sunday newspapers and periodicals,Table 53 shows, by states and geographic divisions, comparative statistics for Sunday newspapers and periodicals published during 1909 and 1904 -I A minus sign ( ) denotes decrease, 2Can not be shown separately wltbout disclostn∑e of individual operations -ï Less than onetenth of 1 per cent The Sunday newspapers and periodicals include and are almost entirely made up of Sunday editions of dailies At the census of 1899 the number was given as 567, but the circulation was included with that of the dailies (or weeklies if not connected with daily papers) No mention was made of Sunday publications in the reports of the census of 1889, but at the census of 1879 the number was stated to be 252, of which 113 were connected with daily newspapers During the 30 years following the lastnamed census, Sunday publications not connected with dailies decreased more than 75 peJ∑ cent in number, while those connected with dailies gained ove;r 330 per cent -In the United States as a whole the increase in the total numbeJ∑ of Sunday newspapers and periodicals for the fiveyear period 19041909 was 26, and that in average circulation per issue, 1,324,941 The West North Central and South Atlantic divisions reported a decrease in number but an increase in circulation The other divisions reported increases in both respects, and all save the Middle Atlantic and the East North Central divisions reported increased proportions of the total circulation These two divisions, nevertheless, together reported 552 per cent of the total circulation of Sunday papers in 1909 -A comparison of Table 54 with Table 47 shows that the Sunday publications in cities of 400,000 population and over increased at a lower rate, both in number and aggregate circulation, from 1904 to 1909, than the dailies exclusive of Sunday publications lhe former class of periodicals increased 1 per cent in number and -88 per cent in circulation during the five years mentioned, while the dailies increased 73 per cent in number and 147 per cent in circulation during the same period No doubt the growth in the circulation of the Sunday publications issued in these large cities has been checked to some extent by the establishment of Sunday newspapers in smaller places The only cities, however, to report an actual loss in circulation of Sunday publications were Stm Francisco and Baltimore WeekliesA weekly \"newspaper\" is a publication issued once a week and giving general and political news and family reading It may or may not be published in connection with a daily -A weekly \"periodical\" is a publication issued once a week and devoted chiefly to purposes other than the spread of general and political news The list includes all the\" popular\" weeklies of large circulation Some of these contain reviews of current news and political matter, but they are not ordinarily considered as \"newspapers\" All religious and college weeklies are classed as \"periodicals;\" also such publications as are devoted to a certain specific interest, as, for instance, agriculture, commerce, fraternal organizations, labor, or science -Table 55 shows, by states and geographic divisions, the number and circulation of weekly newspapers and periodicals for 1909 and 1904 Papers published on Sundays exclusively are not here included In Table 41, however, the statistics of all weekly publications, including weeklies published on Sunday, are shown for the United States as a whole for 1909, 1904, and 1899 -Over threetenths of the circulation of weeklies in 1909 was reported from the states of the Middle Atlantic division, those of the East North Central following with over onefourth The Mountain division had the least of all, 18 per cent Amo:cg the individual states New York reported nearly one1dxth of the total

production of this class of periodicals * * * Magazines were published in very large editions and at such low subscliption rates that they commended themselves to the people of the most moderate resources, especially in remote nrral districts By using the cheapest grades of paper and making small expenditure for literary matter, the cost of production was red11ced so low that a profit was secured even upon a subscription price varying from 10 to 25 cents per annum -Triweelclies and se1niweelcliesThe reduction m circulation of triweeklies and semiweeklies is due in part to the abandonment of semiweekly editions of certain dailies and in part to a decrease in average number of copies reported by some of the others -The great decrease of 2,661,775 in circulation shown for Maine from 1904 to 1909 was clue principally to the abandonment of two large lines of publications which had large circulations An allusion to some of these -lhe decrease in Massachusetts was 1,584,544 copies, due to the discontinuance of two publications in Boston for which a large circulation was reported at the census of 1904 One was devoted to fashions and the other to home topics and \"general literature\"; -the annual subscription price in each case was low Tho decrettse in New York was 2,581,511 copies1 and was reported in tho main by publications in New York City treating of

establishments engaged in the printing and publishing industry are presented, by states, in Tables 66 and 67 -ber of establishments, number of persons engaged in the industry, primary horsepower1 capital invested, salaries, wages, cost of materials, value of products, and value added by manuiacture -Classification of establishmentsThe statistics of the automobile industry as given in the present bulletin cover the operations of two classes of establishments: -(1) Those which manufactured complete automobiles as their product of chief value, and (2) those in which the greater part of the value of products represented automobile bodies and parts In the statistics for the industry as a whole a large amount of duplication is involved, as the greater part of the products of the establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of bodies and parts were utilized as materials in the establishments that manufactured chiefly complete automobiles, and a number of these latter establishments, moreover, reported the manufacture for sale to other automobile manufacturers of considerable quantities of bodies and parts The statistics for the factories which produce complete machines and those which manufacture bodies and parts do not, however, indicate the full extent and importance of the automobile industry, because of the large number of establishments in other industries which manufacture engines or motors, parts of machinery, tools, rubber tires, and other parts and accessories of automobiles In the census reports many of these establishments are included under the classification\" foundry and machineshop products\" The manufacture of automobile rubber tires constitutes part of a separate industry, and although a number of manufacturers of rubber goods reported the value of tires produced,, the practice was not general and their total value, therefore, can not be definitely determined Moreover, many automobile parts, particularly tires, manufactured by establishments not assigned to the classification now under discussion, are sold to dealers or to automobile owners, and do not enter into the value of products of the automobile industry as here presented Table 1 presents a summary of the statistics of the automobile industry for the United States as a whole for 1909 -Of the 7 43 establishments engaged in the manufacture of automobiles, including bodies and parts, in 1909, only 265 manufactured complete automobiles as their product of chief value, but these establishments employed more than twothirds of the average number of wage earners engaged ii1 the entire industry The total value of products in the year 1909 for the two branches of the industry combined was $249,202,075, of which $193,823,108 was the value of products reported by the establishments engaged principally in -the manufacture of automobiles and $55,378,967 that reported by establishments engaged principally in the manufacture of automobile bodies and parts The total obtained by adding the figures for the two branches of the industry involves considerable duplication, as already explained Probably a better measure of the actual value of the products of the automobile industry as a whole is found in the total value of the complete machines manufactured, which was $164,269,324 -Of the 126,593 automobiles turned out by establish~ ments of the industry in 1909, all but 23 were made in establishments reporting complete automobiles as the product of chief value In addition to the automobiles manufactured by establishments assigned to this industry, 694 automobiles were reported by establishments engaged primarily in the manufacture of other products -An average value per automobile computed from the total number of those manufactured in 1909 would have but slight significance, because of the many sizes and varieties included in the total number Even a computation of the average value for the di:ITerent classes of machines for which separate statistics are presented is unsatisfactory for the same reason -1 Establishments whose chief products were nutomobile bodies and ]larts were not included as 11 part of the industry until 1904 -ï Figures not available ï In addition, 694 automobiles in 1009 and 1,138 automobiles in 1904 were reported by establishments engaged primarily in other industries The automobile industry is one of the most recent to be included in the census of manufactures, having been :first reported separately at the census of 1904 At the census of 1899 the manufacture of automobiles was reported as a part of the carriage and wagon industry, but the returns of establishments engaged exclusively or primarily in the manufacture of automobiles have since been tabulated separately, and are presented in the comparative table as the statistics for the industry in 1899 The totals for that year do not include statistics for establishments whose chief products were automobile bodies and parts, but it is doubtful whether there were any such establishments at that time In 1899 the industry was largely in the experimental stage, and that being the case, a com-parison of the totals for 1899 with the statistics for the succeeding censuses is of no great significance The statistics for the censuses of 1904 and 1909, however are fairly comparable and indicate a remarkable growth of the industry during the intervening period, the value of products being more than eight times as great in 1909 as in 1904 It is probable, however, that the figures representing the value of products may exaggerate somewhat the real growth of the industry because, as already explained, they involve duplic~tion to the extent that the products of one branch of the industry reappear in the materials for the other branch Because of the increase in the relative importance of the branch of the industry engaged principally in the production of automobile bodies and parts, this duplication would have more effect upon the later :figures than upon the earlier Statistics as to the number of wage earners and the value added by manufacture, considered as a measure of the growth of the industry as a whole, are free from this objection In 1909 the number of wage earners was more than six times as great as it was in 1904 and the \"value added\" more than seven times as great Ihe increase in the number of automobiles manufactured is another measure of growth, the number in 1909 being very nearly s:ix -Between 1904 and 1909 the manufacture of automobiles, including bodies and parts, advanced in rank among the manufacturing industries of the country from seventyseventh place to twentyfirst with respect to value of products and from seventieth to twentieth with respect to average number of wage earners -Table 3 gives separate statistics for the two branches of the industry for 1909 and 1904, with percentages of increase -The large relative increases shown for the period from 1904 to 1909 in the branch of the industry which reported automobiles as the chief product were in all cases greatly exceeded by those for the branch of the industry chiefly engaged in the manufacture of automobile bodies and parts The average number of wage earners employed in the establishments in the automobile branch was about five tinws as great in 1909 as -in 1904, while the average number employed in establishments whose chief products were automobile bodies and parts was more than trurteen times as great in the later as in the earlier year In 1909 the value of products was more than seven times the figure for 1904 in the automobile branch and more than sixteen times the figure for 1904 in the other branch of the industry -Summary, by statesTable 4 presents the more important statistics for the combined industry, by states, the states being arranged according to the value of products reported for 1909 Separate :figures are given for 19 states, the statistics for the 9 other states in which the industry was carried on in 1909 being combined under the heading of \"all other states\" -to avoid the disclosure of the operations of individual establishments It may be noticed that certain numbers are omitted in the several series of numbers showing the rank of the states in the industry This is because there are certain states included with \"all other states\" which outrank some of the states for which separate figures are given -Michigan is the leading state in the industry, holding first rank at the censuses of 1909 and 1904 in respect to the average number of wage earners employed, the value of products, and the value added by manufacture In 1909 the factories in Michigan reported 336 per cent of the average number of wage earners employed in the industry, 388 per cent of the value of products, and 364 per cent of the value added by manufacture The average number of wage earners employed in establishments of the industry in this state apcl the value added by manufacture were more than nine times as great in 1909 as in 1904, while the gross value of products was more than twelve times as great in the later as in the earlier year In 1909, -716 per cent of the wage earners, 763 per cent of the value of products, and 749 per cent of the value added by manufacture were reported from four states, namely, Michigan, Ohio, New York, and Indiana In the case of each of the states for which separate figures are given in the table, large percentages of increase are shown for every item for the period 19041909 Between 1904 ancl 1909 several changes took place in the rank of the different states as determined by value of products The three leading states, 11ichigan, Ohio, and New York, in the order named, held the same rank at both censuses, as did Wisconsin, which ranked sixth Indiana showed the most pronounced gain in rank, having advanced from seventh place in 1904 to fourth in 1909 Illinois became eighth instead of ninth, and California thirteenth instead of fourteenth On the other hand, Massachusetts dropped from :fifth place in 1904 to seventh in 1909, while Pennsylvania went from eighth to ninth -The following d1agram shows graphically the value of products for the most important states in the industry in 1909 and 1904, while the map shows graphically the value of products in 1900 for each state from which the industry was reported for that year -Table 23 gives such a distdbution of the number employed on December 15, 1909, or the nearest representative day -In order to compare the distribution of persons engaged in the industry according to occupational status in 1909 with that shown at the census of 1904, it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 6 -Salaried employees increased in number at a greater rate than either of the other classes, forming a somewhat larger percentage of the total number of persons engaged in the industry in 1909 (108 per cent) than in 1904 (89 per cent) The percentage of increase in the average number of wage earners was much greater than that in proprietors and firm members, but the proportion which each of these classes represented of the total was smaller in the later than in the earlier year Table 7 shows the average nUJ11ber of wage earners employed in the industry, distributed according to age periods, and in the case of those 16 years of age and over, according to sex, for 1909, 1904, and 1899 -Practically all the wage earners employed in the industry as a whole (98,8 per cent in 1909 and 991 per cent in 1904) were ;males 16 years of age and over The proportion represented by females 16 years of age and over was somewhat higher in 1909 than at the preceding censuses, while the proportion represented by children under 16 years of age was somewhat lower in 1909 than in 1904 The numbers of women and children employed are, however, so small that the changes in the relative importance of these classes since 1904 have little significance Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 8 gives the number of wage earners employed in the ;manuf acture of automobiles (including bodies and parts) on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 for the 10 states in which the average number of wage earners employed during the year exceeded 500 -1 Tho month of maximum employment for each state is indicated by boldlace figures and that of minimum employment by italic figures -The largest number of wage earners employed in the industry as a whole during any month of 1909 was 89,886 in December, and the smallest number 62,724, in January Although the number of wage earners employed in January was equal to only 698 ~er cent of the number reported for December, the mdustry can not be classed as seasonal, the difference in employment during 1909 being due rather to the :increasing demands made on the factories in the later months of the year In 1904 in the automobile branch of the :industry, which gave employment to 85 per cent of the wage earners reported for the combined industry in that year, the month of greatest employment was June, and the minimum number of wage earners, reported for September, was equal to 649 per cent of the maximum -Prevailing hours of laborIn the next table the wage earners have been cl11Ssified according to the hours of labor prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage eamers employed during the year in each establishment is classified as a total according to the hollls prevailing in that establishment, even though some employees worked a greater or less number of hours -More than ninetenths (947 per cent) of the wage earners employed in the industry in 1909 worked in establishments reporting ~rom 54 to 60 hours per week, inclusive, as the prevailing hours of labor Establishments reporting more than 54 but less than 60 hours as the period of employment per week employed -352 per cent of the wage earners, establishments reporting 54 hours 30 per cent, and establishments reporting 60 hours 294 per cent Only 19 per cent were employed in establishments where the ustial hours of labor per week were more than 60, and only 34 per cent in establishments where they were less than 54 Practically all the wage earners employed in establishments where the prevaHing hours of labor were more than 60 per week were reported from Wisconsin and Ohio, and more than threefilths (624 per cent) of those employed in establishments where the hours of labor were less than 54 per week were reported from New York wr -Character of ownershipThe next table shows data as to character of ownership for establishments engaged in the :industry in the United Stat~s in 1909 and 1904 -In both 1909 and 1904 more than fiveeighths of the total number of establishments were under corporate ownership, the percentage being slightly higher in 1909 than in 1904 This group of establishments, however contributed a much larger proportion of the total value of products in 1909 than in 1904, 946 per cent as compared with 881 per cent The proportion of establishments under individual ownership increased slightly during the fiveyear period, but the value of products reported for this group formed a smaller percentage of the total in 1909 than in 1904 As shown by Table 10, establishments owned by firms represented a smaller proportion of the total number of establishments and contributed a smaller proportion of the total value of products in the later than in the earlier year -Table 11 gives statistics in respect to the character of ownership, or legal organization, of the establishments engaged in the industry in the states where an average of more than 500 wage earners were employed in 1909 -In all the states for which separate figures are included in the table, establishments under corporate ownership constituted more than half of the total number and reported the majority of the wage earners and the greater part of the value of products and value added by manufacture The establishments owned by individuals attained their greatest relative importance in Massachusetts, where they did a business about onetenth as great as that done by corporations The establishments owned by firms were of greatest importance in Wisconsin, where they did about half as much business as was done by corporations In all the other states shown in the table the business done by either individuals or firms was rehttively unimportant, although in New York products to the value of over $1,000,000 were reported from establishments owned by individuals, and in Ohio and also in Michigan products to the value of over $1,500,000 were reported by :firms These amounts are, however, small as compared with the production reported by corporations in those states -NoTEIn some states, in order to avo_id disclosing the returns for individual establishments, the figures for one group have been oonaolidated with those for establishï ments under some other form of owneralnp In such cases an (X) 1s placed in the column from which the figures have been omitted and the figures for tho group with -Size of establishmentTable 12 groups the establishments engaged in the manufacture of automobiles, including bodies and parts, according to the value of their products and shows for each group, for 1909 and 1904, the number of establishments and value of products, together with the percentage of the respective totals contributed by each group -In some respects, and especially from the standpoint of conditions under which persons engaged in the industry work, the best classification of establishments to bring out the feature of size is a classification accord:ing to the number of wage earners employed Table 13 gives such a classification, showing the number of establishments in each group and the average number of wage earneTS employed in each of the 10 states where an average of more than 500 wage earners were employed in 1909 -233 per cent, and 164 per cent of the total number of establishments Although the establishnients in these three groups thus constituted 69:3 per cent of the total number, however, they reported only 91 per cent of the wage earners The great majority of the wage earners, 839 per cent, were in establishments having more than 100 wage earners each The single group having the largest number of wage earners was that consisting of establishments with over 1,000 wage earners each, these establishments employing in the aggregate 24,707 wage earners, or 326 per cent of thi total number \\x0cMANUFACTURES -tomplete automobiles In the United States as a whole, the cost of materials represented 658 per cent of the total expenses in the case of establishments whose chief products were complete automobiles, and -508 per cent in the case of those whose chief products were automobile bodies and parts Engines and powerTable 14 shows the number of engines or other motors, according to their character, employed in generating power (including electric motors operated by purchased current), and their total horsepower at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899 It also shows separately the number and horsepower of electric motors, including those operated by current generated in the establishment reporting -The total horsepower used in the industry in 1909 was more than seven times as great as the amount used in 1904 At both censuses the greater part of the power was furnished by steam engines, but such power formed amuch smaller proportion of the total primary power in 1909 than in 1904, the percentages being 52 and 73, respectively On the other hand, rented electric power formed 366 per cent of the total primary power used in the industry in 1909, as compared with only 104 per cent in 1904 -The proportion of the total primary power developed by the use of gas and other internal combustion en-More than onethird (343 per cent) of the total horsepower shown for the industry in 1909 was used by establishments in Michigan, and these, together with the factories of Ohio and New York, reported -659 per cent of the total These three states used 625 per cent of the total steam power, 676 per cent of the power generated by gas and other internal combustion engines, and 719 per cent of the rented electric power Michigan led in the amount of steam power and of rented electric power employed, but was second in respect to power generated by gas and other internal combustion engines, Ohio being first Fuel consumed,The amount expendecl for fuel and rent of power in 1909, $1,661,724, is distributed, by states, in Table 23, and the quantity of fuel used is shown for the leading states in Table 15 -igan led all other states in the consumption of bituminous coal and oil, but Ohio was first in the amount of gas consumed - Automobiles made, classified according to kind of propelling power,Table 16 shows the total number and value of the automobiles reported for the industry in 1909 and 1904, classified according to motive power, with the proportion which each class represented of the total and the percentages of increase between the two censuses -1 Statistics for 1909 include 23 automobiles, valued at $65,800! of which 1 was gasoline and 22 were electric made in establishments whose principn productswcrenutomobile bodies and part/; butdo not include 694automobiles, valued at $839,oso, reï ported by establishments in other industries, chiefly the carriage and wagon mdustryï -Of tho automobiles turned out by establishments engaged in the industry in 1909, 951 per cent were gasoline vehicles, the proportion being considerably larger than that in 1904 (862 per cent) The number of gasoline automobiles made in 1909 was more than six times as great as the number made in 1904 Steam and electric vehicles gained in number at a much less rapid rate, showing increases of 514 and 1685 per cent, respectively, and each of these classes formed a smaller proportion of the total number in 1909 than at the preceding census In 1904 more steam than electric automobiles were reported, but in 1909 the reverse was true It will be observed that for each of the three kinds of automobiles shown in the table a great_er relative increase is shown in the value than in the number This does not necessarily indicate an increase of prices; it may moan simply an increase in the proportion of more expensive machines -Table 17 shows, by states, the number and value of automobiles using the several kinds of motive power made in establishments engaged in the industry in 1909 and 1904 -Michigan was the leading state at each census in respect to both the total number and total value of motor vehicles manufactured The automobiles made in Michigan, where the industry is largely centralized, represented 512 per cent of the total number and 428 per cent of the total value in 1909, and 421 per cent and 276 per cent, respectively, in 1904 -Indiana and Ohio ranked second and third, respectively, in 1909 in the total number of automobiles produced, but in the value of the output Ohio was second and Indiana third While less than half as many automobiles were made in New York as in Indiana, the value of all machines produced in the former statewas practically equal to thatreported for the latter -state m the product10n of electric and steam automo biles, reporting 376

the several types of automobiles ma l in the establishments engaged in the industry in 19~; and 1904 -In the production of touring cars and of runabouts, Michigan was the leading state in 1909, reporting 453 per cent and 478 per cent, respectively, of the total -204 per cent of the total value of touring cars, being exceeded in the value of this class of machines by Ohio, which reported 422 per cent of the total In the value of runabouts, however, Michigan led in 1904 with 459 per cent Indiana ranked next to Mi~higan in the production of runabouts in 1909, while Ohio was the second state in the value of touring cars produced In the production of \"all other varieties\" of pleasure and family vehicles, Ohio was the leading state in 1909, reporting 374 per cent of their total value in that year In 1904 Indiana led, ïreporting 458 per cent of the total value of these cars produced In the number of delivery wagons manufactured in 1909 Michigan was outranked by Ohio and Illinois, and in their value by Illinois and Pennsylvania In 1904 New York was the leading state in the value of this class of vehicles -New York reported the largest number of motor trucks in 1909, but the aggregate value was less than -that reported by :Michigan In 1904, however, New York led both in the number and in the value of such vehicles, reporting 711 per cent of the value -New York led in the value of \"all other varieties\" of business vehicles in 1909, reporting 303 per cent of the total value In 1904 Connecticut was the leading state in this respect, reporting 406 per cent of the total value -All the states for which comparative figures are given show large relative increases in the total number and value of automobiles manufactured, except that Massachusetts reported a smaller number and value for runabouts in 1909 than in 1904, while for \"all other varieties\" of business vehicles Connecticut reported a smaller number and value, and Massachusetts a smaller number, in 1909 than in 1904 -Automobiles made, classified according to motive power and typeTable 19 shows the number and value of the several kinds of automobiles, classified also according to motive power, as reported for 1909 and 1904, with percentages of ii1crease -ïPercent not shown where base is less than 100 for number or less than SW0,000 for value ï A minus sign () denotes decrease The largest percentage of increase in the total number and value for the fiveyear period 19041909 is shown for gasoline touring cars, of which more than eleven times as ma:py were made in 1909 as in 1904 About threefifths of the gasoline machines made in 1909 were touring cars Of electric vehicles, touring cars made a greater relative gain in number and value than any of the other three types for which separate figures are shown, although runabouts were the most numerous class and trucks had the greatest value The use of steam as a motive power for automobiles is confined almost entirely to touring cars, and there was a considerable increase in the manufacture of steam cars of this class The figures here presented indicate that the application of steam to other types of automobiles is not only very limited but is decreasing -Automobiles made, classified according to horsepower ratingTable 20 shows the numbers of the various kinds of machines made in 1909, classified according to horsepower rating -More than ninetenths of the automobiles made in establishments engaged in the industry in 1909 had motors of from 10 to 49 horsepower, 405 per cent of the total number being rated at from 30 to 49 horsepower, 279 per cent at from 20 to 29 horsepower, and -232 per cent at from 10 to 19 horsepower Only 6 per cent of the total number were rated at less than 10 horsepower, and only 25 per cent at more than 50 horsepower Of the passenger automobiles turned out by the factories of the industry in 1909, 617 per cent were touring cars and 294 per cent runabouts The -787 per cent being rated at from 10 to 29 horsepower Nearly all the highpowered automobiles were touring cars More than ninetenths of the touring cars were vehicles of over 20 horsepower, 603 per cent of the total number being rated at from 30 to 49 horsepower and 286 per cent at from 20 to 29 horsepower  -Imports and exportsTable 21, compiled from the reports of the Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, Department of Commerce, shows the number -and value of the automobiles imported and of those exported for the fiscal years 1906 to 1910, inclusive -Data as to imports and exports are not available for years prior to 1906, in which year the value of the imports of automobiles was 99 per cent greater than that of the exports In each year from 1907 to 1910 the value of exports exceeded that of imports, until in 1910 the excess in value amounted to $6,697,254, or -The principal statistics secured from the census inquiry concerning the industry are presented, by states, in Tables 22 and 23

each kind of fuel consumed in the industry in 1909 The amount expended for fuel and rent of power is shown, by states, in Table 9 -ProductsTable 8 gives a detailed statement of the number and value of the several kinds of bicycles and motorcycles manufactured for 1909, 1904, and 1899 -As already stated, the industry was declining at the census of 1899, yet more than a million bicycles were made in that year The output in 1904 was barely onefifth as great and there had been a further decline by 1909 No tandem bicycles or tricycles for adults were manufactured in 1909, although their manufacture had been reported at the two preceding censuses On the other hand, the development of the motorcycle branch of the industry has practically all taken place within the decade covered by the table, and more particularly in the second half of the decade -In the value of all other products, including parts and repairs,\" the increase from 1904 to 1909 was $3,654,178 As these parts consist largely of frames, pedals, saddles, handle bars, coaster brakes, etc, and as but few establishments reporting complete bicycles or motorcycles manufacture all the parts, there is necessarily a considerable duplication in the combined value of products of the industry The extent of this duplication is uncertain, but some idea of it may be obtained from the fact that parts to the value of more than $2,800,000 were reported by establishments which confined their operations to the manufacture of this class of products A large proportion of these parts, however, were without doubt sold to bicycle repair shops, the operations of which are not covered by these statistics -Detailed statistics, by statesThe principal data secured by the census :inquiry concerning the manufacture of bicycles, motorcycles, and parts, other than statistics as to the quantity and value of specific products, are presented :in Table 9 One or more establishments were reported from 16 states, but the greate1ï part of the value of products were reported from 4 states Massachusetts ranked fu∑st and Ohio second, these two states together contributing nearly onehalf the total value of products -Description of the industrySome of the establishments in this industry manufacture complete bicycles and motorcycles, themselves making all or most of the parts which enter into the :finished products Some, on the other hand, manufacture only parts, such as saddles, seat posts, frames, gears, handlebars, and chains, while some establishments do little more than assemble parts made by others The total value of products, by reason of these conditions, involves considerable duplication At the censuses of 1889, 1899, and 1904 the industry designation was \"bicycles and tricycles,\" and the published reports for those years include the statistics for the output of childrens -tricycles and velocipedes, establishments making which were classified under  toys and games at the census of 1909 The comparabilityof the general data for the industry, however, is not greatly affected by this change -Comparison with earlier censusesTable 1 summarizes the statistics for the industry for each census from 1889 to 1909, inclusive -Prior to the census of 1889 the manufacture of bfoycles was of such little importance that it did not receive a distinct classification in the census reports, and the statistics wem included with those of the carriage and wagon industry -1 A mlnus sign () denotes decrease ∑where percentages arc omitted, comparable figures are not available -The evolution of the bicycle from primitive and unserviceable types to a useful and attractive means of travel may be said to have taken place between 1868 and 1890; and its perfection and standardization into practically one form of structure, the modern \"safety,\" between 1890 and 1895 During this latter period the popularity of the bicycle became so wid∑espread that the industry grew very rapidly, but about 1897 it began to decline -833 per cent A considerable recovery of the indust1y as a whole is indicated by the statistics for 1909 While the number of establishments in that year shows a decrease from the number in 1904, the average number of wage earners increased 1,118, or 337 per cent, and the value of products, $5,545,327, or 1076 per cent The most important factor in the renewal of activity in the industry has been the growing demand for motorcycles -∑ earners Of the total number of persons engaged in the industry only 33 per cent were females (825) -In order to compare the distribution of the persons engaged in the industry according to occupational status in 1909 with that in 1904, it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (see Introduction) Such a comparison is made in T11ble 3 -Character of ownershipTable 4 presents data with respect to the character of ownership of the establishments engaged in the industry -ExpensesAs stated in the Introduction, the census figures for expenses do not purport to represent the total cost of manufacture, since they take no account of interest or depreciation, and consequently can not properly be used for determining profits Facts of interest can, however, be brought out concerning the relative importance of the different classes of expense which were reported Table 1 shows the total expenses in 1909 to have been $9,569,392, distributed as follows: Cost of materials, $5,082,569, or 531 per cent; wages, $2,908,199, or 304 per cent; salaries, $582,362, or 61 per cent; and nuscellaneous expenses, $996,262, or 104 per cent It is natural that some pronounced variations from these proportions should appear in certain states, corresponding to differences in the character of the product manufactured Some establishments produce :finished bicycles or motorcycles, themselves making all or most of the parts, some manufacture only parts, and others merely assemble parts made by others -Fuel consumedTable 7 shows the amount of each kind of fuel consumed in the industry in 1909 The amount expended for fuel and rent of power is shown, by states, in Table 9 -ProductsTable 8 gives a detailed statement of the number and value of the several kinds of bicycles and motorcycles manufactured for 1909, 1904, and 1899 -As already stated, the industry was declining at the census of 1899, yet more than a million bicycles were made in that year The output in 1904 was barely onefifth as great and there had been a further decline by 1909 No tandem bicycles or tricycles for adults were

products -Summary for the United States: 1909,The industry \"carriages and wagons and materials\" includes the manufacture of all varieties of carriages, wagons, sleighs, and sleds (except childrens carriages and sleds), and also the manufacture of parts and materials, such as bodies, tops, cushions, hubs, felloes, spokes, wheels, whifiletrees, carriage boots and aprons, axles, dashboards, neck yokes, whip sockets, etc Many small carriage and wagon repair shops were not canvassed by the census, no such shop being included unless it made :five or more complete vehicles during the census year, but a great deal of repair work was done incidentally by the establishments that were canvassed -Comparison with earlier censusesTable 2 summarizes the statistics of the industry for each census from 1879 to 1909, inclusive -1 A minus sign () denotes decrease Where percentages are omitted~comparable figures are not available -ï Comparable figures not available The carriage and wagon industry has existed in this country since early colonial times, and its growth up to the census of 1904 about kept pace with the increase of population The advent of the automobile, and later of the motor truck, has had a decidedly retarding -influence on the industry Many establishments reported at censuses prior to 1909 or 1904 as manufacturing carriages and wagons have since turned wholly or in part to the manufacture of automobiles and have been assigned to the automobile industry -there was a decrease in number of establishments and of wage earners, while seven of the items included in the table show a decrease between 1904 and 1909 -Summary, by statesTable 3 summarizes by states the more important statistics of the industry, the states being arranged according to the value of products reported for 1_909 -The carriage and wagon industry is well distributed throughout the United States, establishments being reported for all states except Nevada In 1909, as in 1904, Ohio ranked first in respect to both value of ∑ -products and value added by manufacture, while in 1904 it ranked first in number of wage earners also Indiana ranked second as to value of products in both years, and first as to number of wage earners in 1909 Most of the states held the same, or practically the same, rank in respect to value added by manufacture in 1909 as in respect to value of products, North Carolina and California being the most conspicuous exceptions Illinois, which ranked third in imporï tance, as measured by value of products, in 1909, showed a more rapid development in the industry -during the period from 1899 to 1909 than any other of the leading states, the number of wage earners increasing 34 7 per cent and the value of products 87 per cent Higher percentages of increase during the period are shown, however, by some of the states of less importance in the industry, particularly Arkansas -Sixteen of the states for which percentages of increase are given in the table show decreases between 1899 and 1909 in the number of wage earners, 10 in the value of products, and 10 in value added by manufacture Of the 10 states with the greatest value of products in 1909, Ohio, New York, and Michigan reported a smaller number of wage earners, value of products, and value added by manufacture in that year than in 1899, while Iowa shows decreases in the number of wage earners and value added by manufacture, and Wisconsin a decrease in number of wage earners -The diagram on page 6 shows graphically the value of products reported for the most important states in the industry in 1909 and 1899, and the map shows the distribution of the industry, by states, for 1909 -Persons engaged in the industryTable 4 shows, for 1909, the numberof persons enga6ed in the industry, classified according to occupational status and sex, and in the case of wage earners, according to age The sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners is estimated by the method described in the Introduction -107 per cent, proprietors and officials, and 4,172, or 5 per cent, clerksthe lastnamed class including other subordinate salaried employees Of the total number of persons engaged in the industry, 80,536, or 971 per cent, were males and 2,408, or 29 per cent, were females Nearly half of the females were reported as clerks, of which class they constituted 283 per cent The average number of boys under 16 years employed as wage earners was 524, or sixtenths of 1 per cent of the total number of wage earners reported -There are some differences between the two branches of the industry with respect to the proportions in the several occupational classes and with respect to the sex: and age distribution Relatively more women and children were employed in the manufacture of carriage and wagon materials than in the manufacture of carriages and wagons -The average number of wage earners in each state, as reported at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899, is given in Table 19 The distribution of the average number by sex and age is not shown for the individual states, but Table 20 gives for 1909 such a distribution for the number employed on December 15, or the nearest representative day Female wage earners were reported from only 26 states, the largest number, 272, being employed in Indiana -In order to compare the distribution of persons engaged in the industry according to occupational status in 1909 with that in 1904 it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made for the industry as a whole in Table 5 -Table 6 shows the average number of wage earners in the industry distributed according to age, and in the case of those 16 years of age and over according to sex, for 1909, 1904, and 1899 (See Introduction) The proportions of men, women, and children employed were practically the same at the three censuses -Wage earners employed, by months,Table 7 gives the number of wage earners employed in the industry as a whole on the 15th (or the nearest 1∑epresentative day) of each month during the year 1909 for -1 The month of maximum employment for each state is Indicated by boldface figures and that of minimum employment by italic figures -The months of m11ximum and minimum employment for 1909, and the number of wage earners reported for such months, are shown for each state in Table 20 -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 8 the wage earners have been classified according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they are employed In making this classification the average number of wage e11rners employed dming the year in each establishment is classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that est11blishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or less number of hours -Approximately 40 per cent of the wage earners employed in the industry in 1909 were in establishments where the prevailing number of hours was 60 per week Only 116 per cent were employed in establishments where the prevailing hours were less than 54 per week, and less than 1 per cent were in establishments working more than 60 hours per week -Sixty hours per week was the most common working time reported in 13 of the 21 states for which separate data are shown Three states, howeverMassachusetts, California, and Connecticuthad more than half of their wage earners in establishments operating 54 hours or less per week; and California reported over onethird as employed in establishments operating 48 hours or less per week Only 12 of the 21 states reported any wage earners working over 60 hours per week -Character of ownershipTable 9 presents data with respect to the character of ownership of the establishments in the industry -The most important distinction shown is that between corporate and all other forms of ownership In 1909, of the total number of establishments reported, 161 per cent were under corporate ownership, as compared with 144 per cent in 1904 While corporations thus controlled approximately onesixth of the total number of establishments in 1909, the value of the products of these establishments represented -684 per cent of the total value of products of the industry, an appreciably larger proportion than∑ in 1904, There was a pronounced decrease between 1904 and 1909 both in the number of establishments operated by firms and in the value of their products There was a slight increase in the number of estab lishments operated by individuals but a decrease in value of their products -There was considerable variation among the states in the relative importance of the establishments under the different forms of ownership Thus in Indiana, the second state in the industry as measured by value of products, establishments controlled by corporations constituted :rn2 per cent of the total number of -establishments, gave employment to 904 per cent of the wage earners, and reported 921 per cent of the total value of products In_ Massachusetts, _on the other hand, corporations controlled only 79 per cent of the establishments, and these gave employment to but 16 6 per cent of the wage earners, and contributed only 163 per cent of the total value of products In Ohio, which led all other states in value of products, corporations controlled 312 percent of the total number of establishments, reported 763 per cent of the total value of products, and gave employment to 725 per cent of the wage earners -Size of establishmentsTable 11 presents statistics for establishments in the industry as a vhole, classified according to the value of their products -127 in 1909 In the carriage and wagon branch of the industry in 1909 the average value of products per establishment was $25,743 and the average number of wage earners was 108 The corresponding figures for establishments making primarily carriage and wagon parts and materials were $55,507 and 28 Table 12 presents a classification of establishments according to the number of wage earners employed, for the leading states -Expenses,As stated in the Introduction, the census statistics of expenses do not purport to give the total cost of manufacture, since they: take no account of interest or depreciation Facts of interest can be brought out, however, concerning the relative impor-There were considerable variations in the proportions represented by the different classes of expenses in the several states (see fable 20) Among the 21 principal states the proportion of the total expenses represented bysalaries ranged from 32 per cent in New Jersey to 7 per cent in Kentucky; that represented by wages v11ried from 201 per cent in Iowa to 426 per cent in Connecticut; that represented by cost of materials from 438 per cent in Connecticut to 669 per cent in North Carolina; and that represented by miscellaneous expenses from 65 per cent in North Carolina to 111 per cent in 1fichigan Variations in the proportions may in a measure be accounted for by the varying importance of repair wo1k In this branch of work few and inexpensive materials are used, while the element of labor, and consequently of wages, is very important Thus in Connecticut, where a large proportion of the value of products represents receipts for repair work, the proportion of the total expenses formed by wages was above the average for the industry as a whole, while the proportion for cost of materials was considerably less than the average Some establishments, on the other hand, make extensive use of parts purchased from other establishments, their work consisting largely of assembling In such cases comparatively little labor is required and the cost of materials constitutes a very large proportion of the total expenses -chased current), and their total horsepower, as re ported at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899 It also shows separately the total number and horsepower of electric motors, including those operated by current generated in the same establishment -36 per cent in 1899 lhere was also a marked increase in the relative importance of gas and other internal combustion engines In 1909 the power of steam engines constituted by far the largest percentage ïof the total primary power, but it was relatively of much less importance in that year than in 1899 -The states which ranked highest with respect to the amount of power used in 1909 were Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, New York, and lliinois, the :five states which ranked highest in value of products The total primary horsepower reported for these states in 1909 was 59,818, or 475 per cent of the total for the United States In all of the 21 states except California, Massachusetts, and North Carolina steam was the most important primary power; in these three states rented electric power was most important Gas and other internal combustion engines were more extensively used in Pennsylvania than in any other state -The establishments in other industries which reportecl the production of carriages, wagons, etc, or partg thereof included establishments in the agricultural implement, automobile, foundry ancl machineshop, lumber, and other industries With respect to the item of $1,184,256 reported as the value of carriage and wagon parts, repairs, etc, made by establishments in other industries, it should be stated that this is probably muchless than the true value of carriage and wagon parts so made Doubtlec,s concerns which made the moreimportant kinds of parts in considerable q uantities reported them separately The concerns making minor parts, particularly if they made them in small quantities, would be less likely to report them Moreover, there are many articles which can be used as parts or materials in the carriage and wagon industry but which are also equally adapted for use in other industries -At the census of 1904 detailed statistics were not secured regardmg vehicles or parts manufactured by establishments outside of the carriage and wagon industry proper, but the total value of vehicles reported as ma,de by such establishments, $612,173, is shown in Table 16 -1 Not reported scparatelv  ï Mannfnctured in establishments devoted primarily to the manufacture of carriages and wagons -The total value of products shown for the industrv at each census involves a certain amount of duplic~tion, due ~o the fact that carriage and wagon parts and materials manufactured by certain establishments in the industry are used by other establishments in the industry in making the completed vehicles As shown in Table 1, the total value of products of establishments engaged exclusively or primarily in manufacturing carriage and wagon parts and materials in 1909 was $34,525,635; the greater part of the products represented by this amount were doubtless used as materials in the industry, though some were, of course used in small repair shops  -represents the value of carriages, wagons, sleighs, and sleds Of the total value of vehicles turned out in 1909, that of family and pleasure carriages formed -523 per cent, th~t of wagons of all kinds 438 per cent, that of pubhc conveyances 1 per cent, and that of sieighs and sleds 23 per cent The number of complete vehicles of all classes manufactured by the establishments ju the industry increaseJ from 1,594,465 in 1~99 to 1,711,529 in 1904, but decreased to 1,519,782 m 1909, the decrease for the decade being 4 7 per cent, and that for the fiveyear period 19041909, 112 per cent The value of the vehicles manufactured, however, was somewhat greater in 1909 than in 1899 This may be due to an increase in prices of vehicles, but it might readily be attributable, at least in part, to changes in the relative proportions of different classes and grades from the one year to the other It should be noted, in fact, that each of the classes of vehicles listed in Table 17 includes a variety of tY})es and grades, so that even if values were shown for each class, a comparison of the percentage of increase in the number with the percentage of increase in value would throw little light on the question of the movement of prices -Between 1899 and 1904 the aggregate number and the value of family and pleasure carriages manufactured increased somewhat, but the number in 1909 was 84 per cent less than that in 1899 and the value -69 per cent less Of the family and pleasure carriages, only those with two wheels show an increase in number during the decade The aggregate number and value of wagons manufac-It may be stated that, of the total value of products ?f establisru;nents engaged primarily in manufacturmg parts and materials, which amounted to $34,525,635 -Family and pleasure carriages were made in 44 of the 48 states of the Union in 1909 The five leacling states in the manufacture of this class of vehicles, however, Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, and Michigan, together reported 603,948 carriages, or 729 per cent of the total number for the United States Of these :five leading states, Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri show gains between 1899 and 1909 in the number made, while Michigan and Ohio show losses Ohio was :first in the number of these vehicles in 1899 and 1904, but was second in 1909, being outranked by Indiana Of the 24 states for which the number of carriages is shown separately, 13 reported decreases in the number made in 1909 as compared with the number in 1899 -Wagons (business, farm, government, etc) were made in 1909 in every state in which the carriage and wagon industry was conducted The four leading states, Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, -together reported the manufacture of 298,586 wagons, or 508 per cent of the total Of the 31 states for which the numbers are given separately, 17 show an increase between 1899 and 1909 in the number made, and 14 a decrease Illinois shows the greatest absolute increase and Michigan the largest decrease Indiana, which was first in the number of wagons manufactured in 1899 and 1904, had in 1909 relinquished first place to Wisconsin, which state had held second place in this respect at the two preceding censuses In value of vehicles of this class manufactured in 1909, Illinois ranked first, Indiana second, and Wisconsin third -The most important states in the manufacture of public conveyances in 1909 were Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and :Michigan -While the manufacture of sleighs and sleds was reported in 33 states, 716 per cent of the total number were made in four states, Michigan, Wisconsin, Mlnnesota, and New York -The principal facts brought out by the census inq_uiry concerning the industry are presented by states in Tables 19 and 20 -industry,

are building brick, fancy and ornamental brick, vitrified paving brick, draintile, and sower pipe; and (2) the pottery, terracotta, and fireclay products industry, the chief products of which are stoneware, earthenware, porcelain ware, and china of various kinds, sanitary ware, fire brick, and torracotta products -Table 1 presents a summary of the statistics of the two clay products industries combined, together with figures for the separate industries, for 1909 -Number of establishmentsïïïïï Persons engaged in the industry Proprietors and firm members ïïï Salaried employees  Wage earners (average number)  Primary horsepower ïïïïïïï -The 5,037 establishments in the two industries combined in 1909 gave employment to an average of 146,786 persons, of whom 132,696 were wage earners, and paid out $78,144,116 in salaries and wages The total cost of materials used in these industries was exceptionally low, equaling in 1909 only 27 per cent of the total value of products, whereas in the case of all industries of the country combined the proportion was 587 per cent This is due to tho fact that the clay used is almost invariably taken from the ground by the employees of the establishments in tho industry, and the cost, therefore, is reported as wages This explains the relatively large wage payments reported; such payments equaled 396 per cent of the value of products, as compared with 166 per cent for all industries combined -549 per cent of the total value of products of tho two industries combined Comparison with earlier censuses,Table 2 summarizes the statistics for the two clay products industries for each census from 1869 to 1909, inclusive The financial figures for 1869 are given in currency, which at that time was worth only about 80 cents, gold, to the dollar For strict comparison, therefore, those figures should be reduced about 20 per cent -1 A minus sign ( _) denotes deoroase Where percentages are om1tted ~omparable f~bllrcs nre not abyallilble,-Substantial increases in value of products wore reported at each census from 1869 to 1909 1he value of products in 1909 was more than four and onehalf times the value in 1869 From 1899 to 1909 the growth of the industries was particularly rapid, the average number of wage earners increasing 255 per cent, and the value of products 768 per cent -Comparison with earlier censusesTable 3

increase in tho cost of materials, value of products, and value added by manufacture for each census period covered by the table, except for the decade 18891899 when there was a decrease The year 1889 was one of unusual activity in this line of manufacture and was followed by a depression from which the industry had not fully recovered in 1899 -Summary, by statesTable 4 summarizes the more important statistics for the brick and tile industry, by states, the states being arranged according to value of products reported for 1909 Some of the states for which data can not be shown separately ranked higher than some named in the table -The brick and tile industry i3 widely distributed throughout the United States, establishments being reported from every state Illinois ranked first at the censuses of 1909 and 1904 in value of products, and :first and second, respectively, in value added by manufacture, and fourth at both censuses in a:verage number of wage earners Ohio ranked second in 1909 in value of products o,nd value added by manufacture, advancing from fourth place in both respects in 1904 Pennsylvania mnked third in 1909 and 1904 both in value of products and value added by manufacture, and seconcl in average number of wage earners, dropping from fast place in this respect since 1904 According to value of products, New York ranked fourth in 1909, dropping from second place, which it held in 1904, but this state ranked first in average number of wage earners, advancing from second place during the fiveyear period -Of the seven leading states in the brick and tile industry in 1909, Iowa shows the largest rellltive mcrease in number of wage earners, value of products, and value added by manufacture during the decade 18991909 -A few of the less important states advanced notably m rank in the industry, as measured by value of products, from 1904 to 1909Washington, from thirtieth to tenth; Texas, from fifteenth to eleventh; Colorado, from twentysixth to sixteenth; North Carolina, from twentyninth to twentysecond; and Oklahoma, from thirtythird to twentyfilth Kansas dropped from ninth place in 1904 to twelfth in 1909; Massachusetts, from seventeenth to twentieth; Wisconsin, from tenth to twentyfirst; and Maryland, from twentieth to twentyseventh -Most of the states helcl the same, or practically the same, rank in respect to value of products in 1909 as in respect to value added by manufacture -Persons engaged in the industryTable 5 shows, for 1909, the number of pernons engaged in the brick and tile industry, classified according to occupational status and sex, and in the case of wage earners, according to age also It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an est:imate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -The average number of wage earners in each state, as reported at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899, is given in Table 16 The distribution of the average nulllber by sex and age is not shown for the individual states, but Table 17 gives such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, or the nearest representative day -In order to compare the distribution of the persons engaged in the brick and tile industry in 1909 according to occupational status with that in 1904, it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 6 -Wage earners represented about ninetenths of the total number of persons engaged in the industry at both censuses, but their number increased only 159 per cent between 1904 and 1909, as compared with -342 per cent for salaried employees The number of proprietors and firm members shows a decrease of rn1 per cent for the fiveyear period Table 7 shows the average number of wage earners in the industry distributed according to age1 and in the case of those 16 years of age and over, according to sex1 for 1909, 1904, and 1899 -There was a constant decrease from census to census, both in the number and in the proportion of children employed, with a slight increase in the proportion represented by males 16 years of age and over At each census the number of women employed was insignificant -Wage earners employed, by months,Table 8 gives the number of wage earners employed in the

according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or -smaller number of hours Over tw?thirds (694 per cent) of the wage earners employed m the manufacture of brick and tile in 1909 were in establishments where the prevailing number of hours was 60 or more per week, 182 per cent were employed in establishments where the prevailing hours were 54 but less than 60 per week, and 124 per cent in establishments where they were less than 54 per week -Rhodo Island ïï Georgia  Illlnols Indiana Iowa

Of the seven groups shown in the table, by far the largest was that made up of the wage earners in establishments where the prevailing hours were 60 per week, such wage earners constituting 661 per cent of the total number This group was the most important, likewise, in all but two of the individual states for which figures are given In California, however, 828 per cent of the wage earners were employed in establishments where the prevailing hours were 54 per week, while in Utah the largest number were employed in establishments where they were 48 or less per week -Character of ownershipfable 10 presents statistics with respect to the character of ownership of the establishments in the brick and tile industry in 1909 and 1904 -In 1909, of the total number of establishments reported for the industry, 348 per cent were under corporate ownership, as compared with 246 per cent in 1904 While corporations thus controlled a little more than onethird of the total number of establishments in 1909 and about onefourth in 1904, the value of products of these establishments represented 69 per cent of the total value of products for the industry -in 1909 and 579 per cent in 1904 Establishments under individual and under firm ownership show a decrease in number during the fiveyear period and establishments under individual ownership a decrease in value of products -1 Includes one establi~hrnent under cooperative ownership, to avoid disclosure of Individual operations -Table II gives statistics for 1909 with respect to establishments under each form of ownelllhip, for the leading states -1 Includes one establishment under cooperative ownership, to avoid disclosure of individual operations -There was considerable variation among the states in tho relative importance of the establishments under the different forms of ownership, but, as measured by value of products, those under corporate ownership predominate to a greater or less degree in all of the states for which statistics are shown in the table In Illinois, the leading state in the industry, establishments controlled by corporations constituted 276 per cent of the total number in the state, gave employment to 751 per cent of the wage earners, and reported 762 per cent of the total value of products In Massachusetts, however, the value of products reported by establishments under corporate ownership was but slightly ir1 excess of that reported by establishments operated by individuals -Size of establishmentsTable 12 presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for establishments in tho brick and tile industry grouped according to the value of their products -Table 13 classifies the establishments in the leading states according to tho number of wage earners employed -Of the total number of wage earners, 28 per cent were reported by establishments employing from 1 to 20; 487 per cent by establishments employing from 21 to 100, and 233 per cent by establishments employing more than 100 wage earners each -ExpensesAs stated in the Introduction, the census figures representing expenses do not purport to show the total cost of manufacture, since they take no account of interest or depreciation; hence they can not properly be used for determining profits Facts of interest can be brought out, however, concerning the relative importance of the different classes of expenses which were reported Table 1 shows the total expenses reported in 1909 for the brick and tile industry in the United States to have been $75,744,418, divided as follows: Cost of materials,

dropped from twelfth to nineteenth; Tennessee, from nineteenth to twentyfirst; Michigan, from twentieth to twentythird; and the District of Columbia, from twentyfilth to thirtyfirst -Persons engaged in the industryTable 20 shows, for 1909, the number of persons engaged in the manufacture of pottery, terracotta, and faeclay products, classified according to occupational status and sex, and in the case of wage earners, according to age also It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -The average number of wage earners for each state, as reported at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899, is given in Table 32 The distribution of the average number by sex and age is not shown for the individual states, but Table 33 gives such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, or the nearest representative day Female wage earners were reported -in 16 of the 29 states for which separate figures are shown The largest number of such wage earners, 3,366, was reported for the state of Ohio, and the next largest number, 1,219, for New Jersey The comparatively few wage earners under 16 years of age were fairly well distributed among the states, the largest number, 304, being reported for Pennsylvania -In order to compare the distribution of persons engaged in this industry in 1909 according to occupational status with that in 1904, it is necess1Lry to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 21 -Proprietors and firm members decreased from 1904 to 1909, while salaried employees and wage earners both increased, the relative gain being the greater in the case of salaried employees Wage earners formed a slightly smaller proportion of the total number o{ persons engaged in the industry in 1909 than in 1904 -The proportion of men and women employed did not change greatly between the three censuses, but there was a constant decrease in the proportion of children employed -Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 23 gives the number of wage earners employed in the industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 for the 12 states in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed during the year -WAGE EARN\"ERS EMPLOYED IN TIIE MANUFACTURE OF POTTERY, TERRACOTTA, AND FffiE∑CLAY PRODUCTS: lGOQt ~ -1 The month of maximum employment for each state is indicated by boldface figures and that of minimum employment by ltallo figures -The manufactUle of pottery, terracotta, and fireclay products is very little subject to seasonal variations, the clay for pottery and kindred products being stored during the seasonable months for use during the cold or wet seasons of the year The largest number of wage earners employed dming any month of 1909 was 59,355, in November, and the smallest number, 50,383, in January, the minimum number being equal to 849 per cent of the maximum In 1904 the maximum number of wage earners employed in the n1dustry was reported for September, and the minimum number, which was equal to 866 per cent of the maximum, was reported for January -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 24 the wage earners in the pottery industry have been classi:fied according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classi:fication the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, oven though a few employees worked a greater or smaller number of hours -Character of ownershipTable 25 presents statistics with respect to the character of ownership of establishments in the industry in 1909 and 1904 -In 1909, of the total number of establishments, 652 per cent were under corporate ownership, as compared with 625 per cent in 1904 While corporations thus controlled a little more than threefifths of the total number of establishments at both censuses, the value of the products of these establishments represented 92 per cent of the total value of products for the industry in 1909, and 902 per cent in 1904 -lubJe 26 MA!,UFACTURE OF POTTERY, TERRACOTTA, AND

and fireclay products industry, grouped according to the value of their products -Table 28 classifies the establishments in the pottery industry in 12 of the leading states according to the number of wage ~arners employed -125 per cent As may be seen by comparing the items in Table 33, the proportions of the total represented by the different classes of expenses vary somewhat in the several states, the difference being due in a measure to the differences in character of the products manufactured Of the total expenses in 1909, the cost of materials represented only 334 per cent, this exceptionally small proportion being due, as in the case of the brick and tile industry, mainly to the low cost of clay, the principal material used Of the total cost of materials, as shown in Table 33, over onethird (345 per cent) was expended for fuel and rent of power Engines and powerThe amount of power used in the manufacture of pottery, terracotta, and fireclay products was fast returned at the census of 1869 for which year a total of 2,148 horsepower was re~ ported Table 29 shows statistics of power used as reported at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899 -constituted all but 11 small proportion of the total horsepower reported, 927 per cent in 1909, as compared with 944 per cent in 1904 and 974 per cent in i899 There was a marked increase in the power of gas and other internalcombustion engines and of electric motors operated by purchased current (rented electric power), and a decrease in the amount of water power used in the industry -The number and horsepower of electric motors used for distributing power by means of current generated in the establishments themselves also show a deci<lod -Table 30 shows for 1909 the amount of each of the several kinds of power and of the different kinds of fuel used in the pottery industry in each of the 12 -In 1909 Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey together reported 61,737 horsepower, or 561 per cent of the aggregate for the industry Steam was the most important power in all of the states The largest amount of steam power is shown for Ohio, and the next largest for Pennsylvania The largest amount of rented electric power is shown for Illinois, and the largest amount of power generated by gas and other internalcombustion engines, for Ohio -Fuel consumed~Bituminous coal was the principal kind of fuel used in 1909, the largest amount being reported by Ohio, which state also reported the largest amount of gas The largest quantity of anthracite coal, or more than fourfifths of the total for the country, was reported for New Jersey, and by far the largest amount of oil by California -manufacture of pottery in New Jersey is largely centralized in the city of Trenton and that of Ohio in East

Survey -cent of the total value of pottery products for the United States in 1909, and 516 per cent in 1899 The increase in the value of pottery products in Trenton during the decade 18991909 was 50 per cent, as compared with 349 per cent for East Liverpool The products of the industryin the two cities are somewhat di:fferent, since sanitary ware, which formed the chief product in Trenton, was not reported for EastLiverpool, while the pottery products in the latter city were practically confined to white ware, C C ware, etc -1 Figures do not ngree with those shown for the city in Vol IX or Thirteenth Ceusus Reports bec!lnse the census of manufactures excludod statistics for certain establishments \\\\vhich were taken by the Geological Sun∑ey -The principal data secured by the census inquiry concerning the manufacture of pottery, terracotta, and 6reclay products are presented in Tables 32 and 33 -the industry, primary horsepower, capital invested salaries, wages, cost of materials, value of products and value added by manufacture for the United State~ and for individual states Table 33 gives more detailed statistics for the industry for 1909 -Table 34 shows the value of products of the combined clay products industries in the United States for 1909, 1904, and 1899 In order to avoid a duplicate canvass, the United States Geological Survey, which annually collects statistics of the production of clay products, and the Bureau of the Census cooperated in collecting data for the year 1909 The figures relative to quantities and values of brick and tile, pottery, ten∑acotta, and :fueclay products, therefore, agree in the reports of the two bureaus for 1909, with the exception that the census report includes among the clay products sandlime brick, the manufacture of which is treated as a separate industry by the Geological Survey The variations in the reports of the two bureaus for other census years may be attributed to differences in the methods employed -ï Product of Ohio included In \"other\" pottery Of the total value of the clay products in 1909, the value of brick formed 58 per cent, that of tile and allied products 234 per cent, and of pottery products -185 per cent The corresponding proportions in 1899 proportions represented by fire, vitrified paving, and front brick were greater in 1909 than in 1899 The relative increase in quantity produced was much less than that in the value of the product, this fact being specially noticeable in the case of :fue brick, which increased 924 per cent in value during the decade and only 47 per cent in quantity -White ware, including C C ware, etc, the most important of the pottery products, represented 442 per cent of the total value of this class of products in 1909 and 37 per cent in 1899 The largest absolute increase in value of products during the decade, $7,351,965, was the class of products just mentioned, but the largest relative gain was in porcelain electrical supplies All of the specified pottery products show large percentages of increase in value for the decade, except red earthenware, for which class of products the increase was small -Scope of the industryThis industry, according to the census classification, embraces establishments manufacturing (1) building glass, which includes window glass, plate glass, and a11 varieties of cast and rolled glass; (2) pressed and blown glass, such as tableware, jelly cups, tumblers, goblets, lamps, chimneys, lantern globes, cloctric light bulbs and globes, opal ware, and cut glass; and (3) bottles, jars, demijohns, etc Only establishments which make glass from tho raw material, silica sand, are included Establishments engaged pr:imarily in glass beveling, bending sheet glass, engraving glass, malting glass labels, and staining and omamonting glass, and those which make cut glassware from purchased \"blanks\" are not included -Comparison with earlier censusesStatistics for the glass industry in the United States :first appeared in -the report of the census of manufactures of 1810, and data relating to the industry have b(ien reported at every subsequent census -1 A minus sign () denotes clecreise Where percentages are omitted, comparable figures are not available -out the 40year period covered by the tablo Comparing 1909 with 1869, it will be seen that the number of establishments was more than twice as great in 1909 os at the earlier date, the number of wage earners more than four times as great, the value of products nearly five times as groat, and the primary horsepower more than sixtysix times as great -Summary, by statesTablo 2 summarizes the more important statistics of the industry, by states, the states being arranged according to the value of products reported for 1909 Some states for which data -The glass industry is highly centralized, the bulk of the production being reported by :five adjoining states These :five states reported more than threefourths (758 per cent) of the number of establishments, over fourfifths (802 per cent) of the wage earners, and almost fourfifths (798 per cent) of the value of products -Pennsylvania was by far the most important state in the industry, the value of the products of the establishments of this state in 1909 representing more than onethird of the total for the United States Ohio ranked sec011d in value of products in 1909 and Indiana third, a reversal of the ranking of these states in 1904 -Of the states shown in the table, West Virginia showed the greatest relative development in the industry, the number of wage earners having increased 2176per cent from 1899 to 1909, and the value of products 3155 per cent, while the state advanced in rank from sixth place in 1904 to fourth in 1909 Ohio and Missouri also showed large increases in number of wage earners and value of products during the decade \" -The average number of wage earners in each state for 1909, 1904, and 1899 is given in Table 19 The average number distributed by sex and age is not shown fo1∑ individual states, but Table 20 gives such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, or the nearest representative clay  Female wage earners were reported from 16 states, the largest number, 1,770, being reported from Pennsylvania, and the next largest, 1,074, from Ohio Employees under 16 years of age were fairly well distributed among the states -In order to compare the distribution of the persons engaged in the industry in 1909, acccording to occupational status, with that in 1904, it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) Such a comparison is made in Table 4, -The most significant fact brought out in this table is the decline in the number of children employed in the industry, only about half aa many being employed in 1909 as in 1899 The number of women employed was comparatively small and was proportionately less -Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 6 gives the number of wage earners employed in the industry on the 15th (or the nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 for 12 of the leading states in which an average of 500 or more wage earners were employed during the year -1 The month of maximum employmont for each state is indicatod by boldlaco figures and that of minimum employment 1,y italic figures -The industry is most active during the colder months of the year, since most establishments shut down for a time during the summer to clean up and make repairs July was the month of minimum employment in six, and August in four states shown in the table lhe fargest number of wage earners employed in the industry during any month of 1909 was 81,665, in ])ecember, and the smallest number, 40,222, in July, the minimum number being equal to -493 per cent of the maximum In 1904 the maximum number, 74,316, was shown for April, and the minimum number, 28,246, for July, the latter number being equal to 38 per cent of the former In five of the states (Indiana, Kansas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia) the month of maximum employment was December and in :Missouri it was November, but in the other states shown in the table the greatest number of wage earners were employed in the spring and early summer -Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 7 the wage earners in the industry have been classified according -to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment was classified as a total, according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or smaller number of hours -More than onehalf (532 per cent) of the wage earners employed in the industry in 1909 were in establishments where the prevailing hours were 54 or less per week, 202 per cent were employed in establishments where the prevailing hours were between 54 and 60 per week, and 266 per cent in establishments where the prevailing hours were 60 or more per week -Of the seven groups shown in the table, the largest was that made up of the wage earners in establishments where the prevailing hours were between 48 and 54 per week, such wage earners constituting 241 per cent of the total number This group was most -important, likewise, in :five of the individual states for which figures are given In Missouri the most common working time was between 60 and 72 hours per week and in Ohlo and Pennsylvania it was between 54 and 60 hours per week -Character of ownershipTable 8 presents statistics with respect to the character of ownership of establishments in the glass industry -884 per cent were under corporate ownership, as com pared with 845 per cent in 1904 In 1909 the value of products of these establishments represented 968 per cent of the total, and in 1904, 94 per cent In 1904, 15 establishments were operated by cooperative associations, but no establishments were reported for this form of ownership in 1909 Table 9 gives statistics for establishments, classified according to form of ownership, for the 11 states employing an average of more than 500 wage earners in 1909 for which :figures can be shown without disclosing individual operations -NOTE,In some states, in order t0 avoid disclosing the returns for individual establishments, the figmes for one group have been conso!Jd11ted with those for establishï ments under somo other form of ownership In such cases an (X) ls placed in the column from which the figures have been omitted, and the figures for the group with which they have been combined nre printed in itallcs -Size of establishments,Table 10 presents statistics for 1909 and 1904 for establishments grouped according to the value of their products -There was a marked decline during the five years, 19041909, both in number and in value of products of establishments producing goods valued at less than $100,000, whereas establishments with products vitluecl at $100,000 or more in each of the years showed an equally marked increase in number and in value of output This latter class represented 684 per cent of the number of establishments in 1909, as compared with -lishment increased from 160 to 190 during this period Classification by number of wage earnersTable 11 classifies the establishments in 12 of the leading states according to the number of wage earners employed -The total primary power used in the glass industry increased from 52,943 horsepower in 1899 to 123,132 horsepower in 1909, or 1326 per cent during the decade At each census, power generated by steam engines constituted more than four:fifths of the total primary power, but in spite of the fact that the amount of steam power almost doubled between 1899 and 1909 it represented a smaller proportion of the total at the later census than at the earlier The amount of power produced by gas or other internalcombustion engines was nearly nine times as great in 1909 as in 1899, and the proportion which such power formed of the total primary power advanced during the decade from 45 per cent to 168 per cent -In 1909 Pennsylvania, Indiana, Ohio, Missouri, and Illinois together reported 107,869 horsepower, or 876 per cent of the aggregate for the industry Steam power was the most important form of power in all of the states shown separately except California, where the amount of steam power was slightly less than that of rented electric power The largest amount of steam power, 43,393 horsepower, was shown for Penn-sylvania, this state also reporting more than half of the total amount of power generated by gas engines -Fuel consumedGas, which was practically all natural gas, was the most important class of fuel used, the quantity amounting to over 43 billion feet The largest amount was reported by Pennsylvania Bituminous coal was next in importance, 1,859,001 tons being consumed during 1909 -302 percent; bottles and jars, 383 per cent; and\" all other products,\" 12 per cent From 1899 to 1909 there was an increase of 539 per cent in the value of the building glass, due largely to the increased production of polished plate glass, which increased 1806 per cent in quantity and 1366 per cent in value during this period The quantity and value of rough plate glass made for sale was less -1 In addition, 42,039 gross of r,ottles and jars, valued at $90,400, were made byestablishments engaged prlnmrily :in the manufacture of products other than those covered by tho industry designation-ï Inaddition, glassware to the value 0!$9,603 was mado byestablfahmants engaged primarily in tho m!lllufacturo of proclucts other than those covered bv tho industry designation ï  Not reported -The value of pressed and blown glass increased 604 per cent during the decade, the percentages of increase in this class of goods being largest for tableware, cut ware, and blown tumblers, stem ware, and bar goods Globes and other electrical goods were not reported separately in 1899; between 1904 and 1909, however, there was an increase of 9,837,383 dozens1 or 517 4 per cent Decreases took place in the output of lamps and their appurtenances, in gas fixtures, and in opal ware Few of the glass plants make fu1ished cut glass, the item \"cut ware\" representing principally the glass blanks, which have not been cut and polished, and which are sold to establishments making a specialty of producing the :finished ware In the general census reports these latter establishments are included under the classification, \"glass, cutting, staining, and ornamenting\" -most of the different kinds reported showing large gains The item \"all other products,\" includes sundry unclassified glass products, paper and wooden bo~es, barrels, metal tops and caps, pottery, and prmted matter -Pennsylvania produced 569 per cent of the total va1ue of building glass in 1909, 359 per cent of the value of pressed and blown glass, and 216 per cent of the bottles and jars, ranking first in the value of each of these products -West Virginia ranked second in the value of building glass produced, and Ohio third, but in tho production of pressed and blown glass the relative ranking of these states was reversed Indiana was second in the value of bottles and jars produced, followed by New Jersey, Ohio, and Illinois, in the order named -EquipmentThe measure of the productive power of a glass manufacturing establishment is the glassmelting capacity of its pot furnaces and tanks Table 17 presents for 1909, 1904, and 1899, the statistics of such equipment by states for the establishments in the industry The idle furnaces and tanks shown in this table represent the idle equipment of active establishments, and not the equipment of establishments which were idle tlu∑oughout the year -The number of continuous tanks almost doubled and the number of rings more than doubled from 1899 to 1909 Intermittent or day tanks, on the other hand, decreased 57, or 438 per cent, in number, while -their capacity decreased 385 tons, or 471 per cent Of the leading states shown, Indiana alone reported a loss for all classes of equipment, the decline in the glass industry in that state being due to the decrease in the supply of natural gas -1

and crown glass polishedï Not roported separately  Included in \"llll other\" glass and glassware exported \\x0cGLASS -At no time during the years covered by the table has the value of exports of glass been as much as half the total value of the glass imported, the nearest approach to this proportion being in 1901, when the value exported equaled 424 per cent of the value imported The exports of glass, however, show a much greater relative increase than the imports, their value being equal in 1909 to 413 per cent of the value of the imports, as compared with only 149 per cent in 1869 The increased demand for glass products in this coun-try has been met almost entirely by the growth of the domestic industry, as is shown by the fact that the value of products of the industry in this country was nearly :five times as great in 1909 as in 1869, while the value of the imports of glass shows a comparatively small increase during the period In 1869 the value of the imports represented 211 per cent of the value of glass manufactured in this country, but in 1909 it represented only 57 per cent -The principal statistics secured by the census inquiry concerning the glass industry are presented, by states, in Tables 19 and 20 -the industry, primary horsepower, capital invested, salaries, wages, cost of materials, value of products, and value added by manufacture -Scope of the statisticsLaundries are not considered as manufacturing establishments, and no statistics for them were gathered at censuses of manufactures prior to that of 1909 The industry has, however, reached such proportions during recent years that it should no longer be omitted from the industrial census This report is confined to power laundries and does not include :figures for hand laundries using no power As a rule, establishments included in the census were operated by steam power and are known as steam laundries In some, however, electric power is employed exclusively, steam and hot water being used only for washing purposes -Partly by reason of the fact that laundries are not ordinarily considered manufacturing establishments, but chiefly in order to preserve the comparability of the general totals for manufactures, the statistics for steam laundries for 1909 have not been included in the totals relating to all manufacturing industries combined, and the data are not presented in the various general tables giving :figures for individual manufacturing industries which appear in Volumes VIII and IX of the Thirteenth Census Reports A summary of the data for laundries in the United States n,s a whole is, however, given separately in Volmne VIII, and a summary of the data for each state in Volume IX -Summary for the United StatesTable 1 presents a summary of the statistics for the laundry industry for 1909 As the industry was not reported at prior censuses, there are no compamtive statistics -amounting to $104,680,086 In this industry there would, of course be no significance in u figure showing the difference between cost of materials and value of products, an item of much significance in the case of manufacturing industries -Summary by states,Table 2 summarizes the more important statistics by states, the states being arranged according to the receipts for work done -The laundry business is usually local in character, and it naturally attains its greatest importance in the states containing the largest population, and in those where the proportions residing in urban communities are highest To some extent, however, the rank of the states in the steamlaundry business is affected by differences in the relative importance of steam and hand laundries and still more by differences in the relative extent to which washing is done in the homes New York, the most populous state, ranked :first in the industry There were 508 steam laundries reported for the state, and they gave employment to 12,578 wage earners, or 115 per cent of the total for the United States The receipts for work done amounted to $11,446,663, or 109 per cent of the total for the industry in the United States Pennsylvania, which ranked second in population, however, was fourth in the steamlaundry industry, being outranked by Illinois and California -Leaving California and Washington out of account, the 10 states ranking highest in the laundry industry in 1909, as measured by the amount received for work done, were the 10 which ranked the highest in population California ranked twelfth and W ashlngton thirtieth in population in 1910, but in the laundry industry these states held third and eighth places, respectively While more than half of the population of both states resided in cities and other incorporated places of 2,500 inhabitants or more, the concentration in urban districts was much less than in a number of other states The high rank of these two states in the laundry industry is therefore evidently due to local conditions and customs; it is probable that a much smaller proportion of the washing is done at home than in most other states, one reason for this being the difficulty of securing satisfactory domestic help The higher prices charged by laundries in the Pacific and Mountain states also tend to increase the relative importance of the industry in these states as measured by the amount received for work done -The rank of the states according to the average number of wage earners employed differs somewhat from their rank according to receipts for work done, partly because of the varying prices charged in different -states With the exception of New Mexico, all the Pacific Coast and Mountain states rank higher in amount received for work done than in number of wage earners For the majority of the other states the rank in number of wage earners is the same as or slightly higher than the rank in the amount received for work clone The 15 states ranking highest in the -laundry industry as measured by value of work done contained 592 per cent of the population of the United States The amount received for laundry work in these states formed 743 per cent of the total receipts, and their laundries gave employment to 731 per cent of the total number of wage earners employed in the industry -Persons engaged in the operation of laundries,Table 3 shows the number of persons engaged in the steamlaundry industry in 1909, classified according to occupational status and sex, and in the case of wage earners according to age The table also shows the percentage of males and females in each c]ass It should be borne in mind that the sex and age classificat1011 of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate obtained by the method described in the Introduction -The laundry industry is ono of the few covered by tho census of manufactures in which the number of feroale employees exceeds the number of males The 81 833 females employed in 1909 formed 659 per-cent of the total number of persons engaged m the industry Of the total number of wage eamers, 712 per cent were females Females also predominate in the clerical force, forming 539 per cent of the total number There were 943 children (persons under 16 years of age) employed as wage earners, and of this number, 716 per cent were females Men, however, predominate in the administrative force of the laundries -The average number of wage earners for each state, as reported for the census of 1909, is given in Table -14 The distribution of the average number by sex and age is not shown for the individual states, but Table 14 gives such a distribution of the number employed on December 15, or the nearest representative day The greatest number of women (16 years of age or over), 9,164, is shown for New York Illinois ranked second with 7,323, and Pennsylvania third with 7,048 The largest number of children (persons under 16 years of age), 197, was reported for Pennsylvania, and of these, 158 were females There are seven states in which more than 4,000 female wage earners 16 years of age or over were employed -Table 4 shows, in percentages, for each state in which more than 1,000 wage earners were employed, the distribution according to sex and age 0£ the wage earners employed December 15, 1909, or the nearest representative day -Females formed twothirds or more of the wage earners in all but five of the states for which more than 1,000 wage earners were reported The three adjoining states of Minnesota, Michigan, and Wisconsin show the largest proportion of females, the percentages being 799, 77, and 767, respectively The smallest proportion, 603 per cent, is shown for California The proportion of children under 16 was highest, 43 per cent, -in Maryland Prevailing hours of laborIn Table 5 the wage earners employed in the industry in the leading states have been classified according to the number of hours of labor per week prevailing in the establishments in which they were employed In making this classilication, the average number of wage earners employed during the year in each establishment is classified as a total according to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though a few employees worked a greater or less number of hours -In the United States as a whole 432 per cent of the waae earners employed in steam laundries during 1909 we;e in establishments where the prevailing number of hours was 54 or less per week Of the 7 groups shown in Table 5, the largest was that made up of the 36 884 wage earners in establishments where the prevailing hours were 60 per week, who constituted 337 -per cent of the total number Of the total number of wage earners employed in the industry, 82,238, or -751 per cent, were engaged in laundries in which the hours of employment ranged from 54 to 60, inclusive, per week, these being the most common hours in a majority of the states listed Wage earners employed, by monthsTable 6 gives the number of wage earners employed in the laundry industry on the 15th (or nearest representative day) of each month during the year 1909 for the 39 states in which 500 or more wage earners were employed during the year -smallest number, 103,746, in January, the minimurn number forming 906 per cent of the maximum The greatest number of wage earners is employed during the summer months, and the table shows that in 34 states the largest number was reported for either July, August, or September, while in 35 states the smallest number was shown for either January or February Employment in the industry, however, is not subject to any great changes from season to ∑ season It is probable that receipts for work done would show a greater variation from season to season than the number of employees, as adjustments in the working force can not be made to follow closely upon -1 The month of maximum employment for each state is indicated by boldface figures and that of minimum employment by italic figures -Character of ownership,Table 7 presents data with respect to the character of ownership of the laundries in the various states -The most important distinction shown is that between corporate and all other forms of ownership Of the total number of laundries covered by the census, about 22 per cent were under corporate ownership While corporations thus controlled less than onefourth of the total number of establishments, they gave employment to about onehalf of the wage earners and reported about onehalf of the total amount received for work done during the census year Establishments operated by individuals were second in importance to -those operated by corporations, comprising 534 per cent of the total number of laundries, giving employment to 299 per cent of the wage earners, and reporting 29 per cent of the total amount received for work done Partnerships or :firms operated 243 per cent of the laundries, these establishments giving employment to 194 per cent of the total number of wage earners, and reporting 193 per cent of the total amount received for work done From the standpoint of number of wage earners employed, the corporate was the most important form of ownership in all but 18 of the states, and the individual was the most important in 14 states -NOTEIn some states, in order to avoid disclosing tho returns for indivi~ual establishments, t~c figures for one group haYe

according to sizeTable 8 presents statistics for laundries grouped according to -Of the 5,186 laundries covered by the census of 1909 none reported receipts amounting to as much as $1,000,000, and only 140, or 27 per cent, reported receipts amounting to $100,000 or over While these large establishments represented a very small proportion of the total number, they reported 204 per cent of the total amount received for work done On the other hand, the small establishments, those that reported less than $20,000 as received for work done during the year, represented 714 per cent of the total number, while their receipts formed 275 per cent of the totaJ receipts for all laundries -Table 9 gives a classification of the laundries in each∑ state according to the average number of wage earners -wage earners was reported for the 1,000 establishments in which from 21 to 50 wnge earners were employed, Expenses of steam laundriesAs stated in the Introduction, the census figures for expenses do not purport to represent the total cost of the operation of the laundries, since they take no account of depreciation, and consequently they can not properly be used for determining profits Facts of interest can be brought out, however, concerning the relative importance of the different classes of expenses which were reported ∑Table 1 shows the total expenses reported by laundries to have been $85,187,604, divided as follows: -Table 10 shows for each state the percentage of the total expenses represented, respectively, by salaries, wages, cost of materials, and miscellaneous expenses -Payments for salaries and wages together comprised more than threefilths of the total expenses of the operation of laundries, the percentage of such expenses in the different states ranging from 505 per cent in North Dakota to 682 per cent in Montana The cost of materials also forms an important item of expense, ranging from 16 per cent of the total in New Mexico to 29 per cent in Idaho The percentages for miscellaneous expenses range from 94 in Idaho to -Eng~nes and powerThe st~tistics of powe~ used in !also gives the quantity of the different kinds of fuel laundries are shown by states m Table 11, which tn,ble reported as consumed in the industry -The total primary power used in laundries amounted to 123,477 horsepower Steam was the most important kind of power reported, the power of steam engines amounting to 105,272 horsepower and forming -853 per cent of the total primary power used in the industry Rented electric power (motors run by purchased current) was next in importance, with 11,157 horsepower, or 9 per cent of the total This form of power was used to some extent by laundries in all of the states except Neva<la In a large majority of the states electric motors were also used for the distribution of power by means of electric current generated in the same establishment The states which ranked highest with respect to the total primary power used were New York, lliinois, Pennsylvania, California, and Ohio, the largest amount, 12,637 horsepower, being reported for New York Fuel consumedClosely related to the question of the kind of power employed in laundries is that of the fuel consumed in generating this power, or otherwise used in the industry Fuel is one of the important items of expense in the conduct of a laundry Table 11 shows that coal was the principal class of fuel used, the laundries consuming 1,065,374 tons during 1909 Oil and gas were also used to a considerable extent, by far the largest quantity of oil being consumed in California and the largest quantity of gas in Ohio -Laundries in citiesLaundries are naturally located in places where a considerable local population is to be served All of the establishments returned at the -census of 1909 were in cities or in towns of consider~ able size Table 12 shows the more important statistics of laundries located in cities and towns of 10,000 inhabitants or over in comparison with those located Ol!ltside such places -This table shows that 599 per cent of the total number of laundries reported were located in cities having a population of 10,000 01∑ over These establishments employed 833 per cent of the total number of persons reported as engaged in the industry, and reported 845 per cent of the total receipts for work done -Data for each city having 10,000 inhabitants or over in 1910, so far as they can be presented without disclosing the operations of individual establishments, are given in Table 13 -1 Incttludes the cities shown in note on page 896,

10,000 or over in 1910, but steam laundries were reported for only 557 of these places There were only six cities in which as many as 2,000 persons were engaged in the laundry industry, or in which the receipts for work done during the year amounted to $2,000,000 or over ,These cities, in the order of their importance as measured by receipts for work done, were Chicago, Ill, New York, N Y, Philadelphia, Pa1 San Francisco, Cal, Los Angeles, Cal, and St Louis, Mo The population of New York was more than double that of Chicago, but the receipts for laundry work in steam laundries were only about threefourths as great The population of St Louis was 687,029, while that of San Francisco and Los Angeles was 416,912 and 319,198, respectively, though both of these cities outranked St Louis in receipts for laundry work There were, however, 21722 persons -engaged in the industry in St Louis, as compared with 2,385 in Los Angeles and 2,257 in San Francisco Boston, which ranked filth in population, having 670,585 inhabitants in 1910, ranked tenth in the laundry industry in 1909 In addition to the cities named, Cleveland, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Detroit, and Buffalo all have a larger population than San Francisco, and yet San Francisco outranked all of them in its laundries Los Angeles is the seventeenth city in population, but in 1909 ranked filth in the amount received for laundry work, and filth in the number of persons engaged in the laundry industry It is probable that in some cities a larger proportion of the laundry work is done by hand laundries, the statistics for which are not included in this report, than in others -Detailed statistics, by statesThe statistics secured by the census inquiry concerning laundries are presented in detail, by states, in Table 14 -NEW YORK CITY CLEVELAND CHICAGO BUFFALO PHILADELPHIA DETROIT PITTSBURGH CINCINNATI BOSTON BAL TIM ORE ST LOUIS MINNEAPOLISST PAUL -The metropolitan districts for which statistics are presented in this report include not only the area within the corporate limits of the city but also parts of the surrounding territory which may in a general way be regarded as closely associated with the development of the city Statistics as to the population of important urban centers, which are termed \"metropolitan districts,\" have been published in the Thirteenth Census bulletin entitled \"Population of Cities,\" and the boundaries of the districts as there defined have been adopted for the presentation of statistics relative to manufactures Although these districts were not defined on an industrial basis, it is believed that they include most of the important factories which are intimately connected with the growth of the central cities -In many cases manufacturing establishments of considerable size are located just outside the b01mdaries of cities Such sites are purposely chosen hy manufacturers who wish to secure all the advantages of an urban location, such as a plentiful supply of labor, good shipping facilities, and the like, and at the same time escape as many as possible of the expenses and restrictions which they would incur in building their plants within the city limits The corporate limits of some cities have been extended so as to take in important manufacturing suburbs, while the boundaries of other towns have remained unchanged, although important manufacturing suburbs have developed When city limits are established or extended the boundaries are in many instances fixed in such a way as to leave outside certain plants which would be expected to come within the city limits Obviously, the statistics for a city alone do not always accurately represent its importance from an industrial standpoint It follows, therefore, that the exact importance of a city as a manufacturing center can be ascertained only by combining with the statistics for establishments actually located in the city, figures for the neighboring manufacturing establishments identified or closely associated with its industrial development -Method of defining districtsThe metropolitan district as defined for the census of 1910, in a general way consists of the city, together with the civil divisions of urban character lying within 10 miles of the city limits Divisions which lie partly within and partly without the 10mile limit arc included if either onehalf of their total population or onehalf of their -total area comes within that limit State boundaries are disregarded, so that in some cases the metropolitan district lies partly in two states The area within the 10rnile limit thus defined is, of course, a very different thing from the area of a circle having as its radius a line extending 10 miles from the center of the city; nor is it the area bounded by a line drawn parallel to the city boundary at an exact distance of 10 miles, because in mapping out the district no civil divisions can be subdivided Hence the outline of the area does not follow geometrical lines, but conforms to the boundaries of the political divisions which are on the outer edge of the included area Owing to this fact, the boundaries of the adj a cent territory thus defined sometimes vary considerably in their actual distance from the city lines The area considered in this report is the net area, or land surface only -Districts for which statistics are presentedThe statistics for 13 districts only are shown in the report, as the retabulation necessary to make a similar presentation of the figures for all metropolitan districts in the United Stntes is impracticable The metropolitan di3tricts were selected for this presentation according to their population -The central cities of the districts selected are, in the order of the importance of the districts as manufacturing centers, as follows: New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Boston, St Louis, Cleveland, Buffalo, Detroit, Cincinnati, Baltimore, Minneapolis and St Paul, and San Francisco and Oakland The districts are presented in the same order in the report -Comparison with earlier censusesThis report is a continuation of a similar report prepared in connection with the census of manufactures of 1904 (Bulletin 101, Industrial Districts, 1905), which contains statistics for 1904 and 1899 for 13 \"industrial\" districts The central cities represented in the earlier bulletin are the same as those in the present report, except that Providence was included while Detroit was not -Owing to the fact that different methods were employed in mapping out \"metropolitan\" and \"industrial\" districts, the area of the metropolitan district in 1909 is in most cases very different from that of the industrial district in 1904 and 1899 Since in the case of Boston a strict application of the rule used for determining metropolitan distrfots at the population census of 910 would have given an are11 almost identical ,vith the area of the industrial district of Boston in 1904 and 1899, the latter area was for conveni-ence of comparison considered as the metropolitan district The same was true of New York City, except that Nassau County, and a part of the town of Rye, -N Y, which were not included in the industrial district, were added to the metropolitan district, and Maywood borough, N J, which was in the industrial district, was not included in the metropolitan district In the case of the other industrial districts shown in the bulletin mentioned, the areas were so different from the metropolitan districts, as determined by the application of the rule described above, that no attempt was made to secm∑e conformity On account of the differences in the areas as defined for the two reports, it was deemed advisable, in compiling the tables showing totals for the districts at the various censuses, to segregate the figures for the territory added and that deducted since 1904 and to compute increases only Oll the basis of the figures for the area which was comprised in the district at both cellsuses In the comparison of selected industries, however, it was deemed best, except for the Pittsburgh district, to make no segregation of the figures for the territory added or deducted since 1904, as only a few of these industries were greatly affected; allusions to such will be found in the text -Summary of the statisticsAlthough the main purpose of this report is to bring out the importance of the individual districts as manufacturing centers in separate sections devoted to each, some interest and significance attach to the summarized statistics as presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3 Table 1 is a summary for 1909 of tl10 statistics of manufacturing industries, with a statement of the population in 1910, for the 13 districts combined, for the central cities, and for the remainder of the territory comprised in these districts The percentage which the figure for the combined cities represents of the total for all districts is shown in the case of each item -fhe percentages which the statistics for the group of central cities represent of the totals for the districts range from 594 per cent for primary horsepower to 858 per cent for proprietors and firm members The central cities contained 756 per cent of the population of the districts in 1910 and contributed 736 per cent of the value of manufacturerl products in 1909 -Comparison with United States totalsTable 2 is a summary of the statistics of manufacturing industries in 1909 and of the population in 1910 for the United States and for the group of 13 metropolitan districts, together with the percentages which this group reported of the totals for the United States -total for the United States in 1910, while the percentages for the items relating to manufactures for 1909 range from 238 for primary horsepower to 475 hr salaries -Table 3 is a detailed statement of the statistics of manufactures, population, and area, as reported at the Thirteenth Census for each of the metropolitan districts included in the report -As defined at the census of 1910, the metropolitan district includes in addition to the central city 15 cities, 41 boroughs, 2

a statement of the population in 1910, for the New York City metropolitan district, for 22 incorporated places and for the remainder of the district The percentage which the figure for New York City represents of the total for the district is shown in the case of each item -In the New York City district the greater part of the value of the manufacturecL products of the district was reported by factories within the central city, -wluch is the leading commercial city and the industrial metropolis of the United States New York City contained nearly threefourths (736 per cent) of the population of the district in 1910, and contributed more than twothirds (683 per cent) of the value of products in 1909 Its manufacturing establishments constituted over folllfifths (816 percent) of all in the district and gave employment to more than seventenths of the wage earners (702 per cent) -Of the places outside of New York City for which statistics ar0 given separately, Newark had the largest value of products in 1909, representing 68 per cent of the total for the metropolitan district The population of Newark in 1910 formed 54 per cent of the total for the district -The part of the district that was outside the cities and towns for which separate figures are given, with an aggregate population equal to 48 per cent of the total for the district, contributed 57 per cent of the value of the products -The value of the manufactured products of New York City in 1909 was nearly 60 per cent greater than was reported by Chicago, the city next in rank in this respect, and it was also greater than the value of products reported by any state other than New York, with the exception of Pennsylvania New York City ranked firnt in value of products among the cities of the United States in 5 of the 15 leading manufacturing industries of the United States, namely, the making of womens clothing, with over twothirds (693 per cent) of the total for the United States; the making of mens clothing, including shirts, with 384 per cent of the total; printing and publishing, with 249 per cent; the bakery industry, with 156 per cent; and the manufacture of tobacco products, with 15 per cent -lhe 22 cities and towns in the district exclusive of New York City for which separate statistics are shown in the table together reported 26 per cent of the value of products for the district in 1909 and a somewhat lower proportion of the population in 191022 per cent In these cities and towns, which are mentioned here according to rank in value of products, the leading industry or industries were as follows: Newark, the smelting and refining of copper, the tanning, currying, and :finishing of leather, foundries and machine shops, the manufacture of jewelry, and the brewery industry; Jersey City, slaughtering and meat packing, the manufacture of tobacco products, the gas and soap industries, the refining of sugar, and the refining of petroleum; Bay-onne, the refining of petroleum and smelting

industries in Chicago Heights in 1909 were foundries and machine shops, steel works and rolling mills, and steamrnilroad car construction shops The principal industry of Evanston was the -manufacture of wrought iron and steel pipe In Cicero foundries and machine shops and the manufacture of wrought iron and steel pipe constituted the most important industries Ihe production of illuminating gas occupied first place in Oak Park In Gary, Ind, three establishmentsa steel plant, a blast furnace, and a cement factory, named in the order of their importancetogether contributed nearly the total value of the manufactured products of the city The principal industries of Hammond were distilleries, steamraihoad repair shops, and foundries and machine shops The manufacture of iron and steel was the leading industry in East Chicago An important industrial place for which the statistics are not shown separately is Indiana Harbor, Ind, with large steel works and rolling mills -Comparison with

second, the \"general nature of industry, business, or establishment\" in which the person worked; third, whether the person was an employer, an employee, or working on his own account; fourth, if an employee, whether he was out of work on April 15, 1910, and, fifth, if anemployee, the number of weeks he had been out of work <luring the calendar year 1909 The enumerators were instructed to return an occupation for every person engaged in gainful labor, irrespective of age, but as yet no statistics have been prepared on the occupations of children under 10 years of age The statistics of occupations reported in this volume are limited, therefore, to gainful workers 10 years of age and upward The term \"gainful workers,\" as used in the printed instructions to enumerators and in this report, includes all workers, except women doing housework in their own homes, without salary or wages, and having no other employment, and children working at home, merely on general household work, on chores, or, at odd times, on other work -General conditions of enumerationThe occupation returns for the Thirteenth Census form part of the information obtained in the general enumeration of -population which was taken as of April 15, 1910, through the agency of approximately 70,000 enumerators The questions concerning occupations were five of the 32 items of inquiry included in the population schedule to be answered, so far as applicable, for each person enumerated In order to secure a definite statem:ent of the specific occupation, trade, or profession of each person engaged in gainful labor, detailed explanations concerning the manner of returning occupations were given tlie census enumerators in a book of printed instructions1 In addition, the census supervisors were directed to 穏ive the enumer~ ators personal instruction prior to the enumeration and to supervise their work during the enumeration The supervisors were directed1 also, to examine and scrutinize the completed schedules received from the enumerators, and, in the event of discrepancies or deficiencies in the same, to cause these to be corrected before sending the schedules to the central office at Washington But many of the supervisors did not fully observe these requirements, and, as a result, numerous improperly filled schedules reached Washington at a date too late for them to be returned to the enumerators for correction In general, then, the accuracy of the occupation returns in 1910, as at previous censuses, was dependent very largely upon the intelligence and interest of the army of enumerators They were more nearly accurateJ however, than at any previous census for these two special reasons: The instructions to the enumerators were more definite and emphatic; and the schedule contained two columns for the return of the occupation and the industry or place where it was pursued, instead of one, as at previous censuses From decade to decade, since the first Federal census of occupations in 1820,doubtless there has been a gradual improvement in the occupation returns, and it is probable that the rate of improvement has been greater with each succeeding decade; but the improvement in the returns in 1910, as compared with those in 1900, probably was far greater than at any preceding decade This improve-1 The paragraphs relating to the portions of the occu:pation inquiryfor which statistics are here presented are reprinted m the Appendu:, p 87 -ment must be attributed largely to the introduction in the schedule of the additional column for the return of the industry or place of employment, for without this information a large percentage of the returns could not have been classified properly For example, in 1900 the returns for fully onehalf of the bookkeepers, clerks, stenographers, and typewriters were given in such general terms that the attempt to distinguish those employed in Government offices, manufacturing establishments, and offices of professional people from those engaged in trade and transportation was rendered futile/ but in 1910 it was possible to make this distinction for all but about oneeighth of the same classes And aga礽, while in 1900 \"it was necessary to classify persons engaged in manufacturing and mechanical pursuits under general designations denoting the place of work or article produced, rather than under specific terms indicating the kind of work done,\" because \"the proportion of indefiniteness in the returns of the groups of workers comprehending such general designations as makers, workers, employees, laborers, etc,\" ranged \"from onefifth to onehalf of the whole number of persons in each group,\" 1 in 1910 the returns for probably not over one tenth of all the persons in the same classes were in such general terms that they could not be classified fairly well according to the kind of work done In certain industries, however, the proportion of \"not specified\" returns was considerably over onetenth of all; and in many cases occupations could not be classified as specifically as desired, but had to be combined with other similar occupations under somewhat general classes -Enumeration of the negroes of the SouthThe occupations of the negroes of the South were less carefully returned by the enumerators than were the occupations of the whiteE! To a large extent this was due to the greater difficulty of the task, because of the greater amount of ignorance in the negro population, but in part it was due, probably, to the inefficiency or carelessness of the enumerators The most serious errors in the returns of the occupations of the negroes resulted from some of the enumerators adopting fixed forms for entries in the occupation columns of the schedule and then following these forms without proper regard to the other facts in the individual cases, such as those of age, sex, family relationship, farm ownership, etc In general, there was too great a tendency among the enumerators to return a gainful occupation for every negro, especially for every negro woman and child While it is well known that the negro women and children in the South work in the fields much more commonly than do white women and -?i稵welfth CenaUB Report on Occupations, p xxvi children 昳n any section of the country, still the returns showed that frequently \"gainful\" occupations were returned for negro women and children in the South who, elsewhere, would not have been considered gainfully employed -In the work of editing, many impossible returns of negro persons gainfully occupied were rejected; but in the merely doubtful or somewhat improbable cases the returns of the enumerators were accepted For these reasons, probably too many negro persons !},re reported as gainfully occupied -Enumeration of the IndiansIn general, the occupations of the Indians were not so carefully returned by the enumerators as were the occupations of the whites No doubt this was due largely to the greater difficulty of the task, but in some cases it was evidently due to the inefficiency or carelessness of the enumerators In editing the returns, the most improbable cases of Indians returned as gainfully occupied were rejected; but, notwithstanding this, it is probable that too many of the Indians are reported as gainful workers This is certainly true in the case of particular tribes, where the proportion gainfully employed sometimes exceeds 60 per cent -Enumeration in AlaskaIn Alaska the enumeration was in the winter In some of the outlying, sparsely populated districts it w;,; !!c~r~? 1lse as enumerators persons whose ed:ucation often was qm~昬 limited and many of whom had no special clerical ~~ty Moreover, the Indian population of Alaska t,e illiterate Under these conditions enumeral ?:/_;:was at best difficult But, because c:,:if:~1that the Indians are mainly hun~~trappers, fishermen, and deer herders and keepers, there was little danger of the enumerators confusing occupations However, some of the Indians may have been missed entirely, and probably others were returned as gainfully occupied when they should not have been The conditions under which the white population was enumerated were better, but, in many cases, they were quite difficult This was especially so in case of scattered and migratory miners, fishermen at sea, and men temporarily employed in railroad construction work The shifting and transient element in the popu19tion made it very difficult to avoid omissions and duplic!ltions Agents were placed at the ports of entry and all persons arriving or departing on vessels were enumerated, and in many cases letters were sent persons temporarily away from Alaska The use of but one column in the Alaska schedules for the return of both the occupation and the industry in which it was pursued, doubtless detracted somewhat from the accuracy of the occupation returns for both the whites and the Indians -The new classification of oocupationsFrom the Federal census of 1850, 1 when the present method of individual enumeration was first inaugurated, twtil the enumeration in 1910, such a large proportion of the occupation returns were in general and indefinite terms that, in many cases, exact classification according to specific occupation wus impossible Therefore, of necessity, the classification followed was, in many respects, largely industrial in form Occupations, such as farmer, blacksmith, carpenter, doctor, and lawyer, which, usually, were carefully returned by the enumerators and which could be classified easily apart from industries, were so classified The remaining occupations, especially in manufacturing industries, were classified under such industrial groups as \"Cotton mill operatives,\" \"Woolen mill operatives,\" etc, without any attempt to distinguish the different specific occupations in each group, such as spinners, weavers, winders, etc AB time passed, this form of classification became more and more inadequate to meet new developments and to satisfy the increased demands for more accurate and detailed iuformation about the occupations of the people At the Thirteenth Census, it was believed that the special efforts that wero being made to secure a more careful return of occupations would be sufficiently successful to justify an attempt at a more exact and scientific classification A little study showed that mere changes in the old classification would not be sufficient, and that a new classification must be formulated -Since the value of occupation statistics is dependent very largely upon the form in which the occupations are classified, the basis of classification is of prime importance After a study of the classifications in use in a number of the principal countries, it was decided that the proper basis for a classification of occupations is the worker and bis work, and, hence, that occupationsshould be classified with respect to the kind of work done or the character of service rendered rather than according to the article made or worked upon, or the place where the work was done However, since many occupations mean little when considered apart from the industries in which they are pursued, it was believed that the best form of classification for -i the United States would be an occupational classification with an,industrial framework It was thtmght that such a classification would give the most vivid picture of the occupational position of each and every worker, and that it would best show the specific services rendered, work done, or processes performed 1 The returns in 1850 related on1v to :free males over 15 years of age, but in 1860 they were made to穋over free persons of both sexes over 15 years of age Since 1870 the returns have covered either all persons irrespective of age or those 10 years of age and over Theinslructions to enumerators, so far as they relate to occupations, at each census since and including 1870 are reproduced in the Appendix, p 82 -by each worker It was seen, too, that this form昽f classification would allow of expansion or contraction to suit the changes in occupations and industries which it is evident will come v;ith the future industrial development of the country -In the development of this new classification, each important industry, or service group,2 穡as taken as a separate unit, and each of the specific occupations followed by the workers in it was listed thereunder so far as such occupation was indicated by the returns of the Twelfth Census enumerators In this manner, eachimportantoccupation returned by theenumerators in 1900 was listed separately under its proper industry or service group,3 and these industries and service groups were then divided into eight general divisions -Heretofore the United States classification of occupations has been rendered illogical and unsci~ntific by the practice of forcing all industries and occupations into five general divisions, namely, agricultural pursuits, manufacturing and mechanical pursuits, trade and transportation, professional service, and domestic and personal service As a result, accurate general statements often have been impossible, because some of these general divisions havecontaine<l distinct industrial and occupational groups In the new classification, an effort has been made to remedy this defect by increasing the number of general divisions from five to eight The title of the fust general division of the old classification, \"Agricultural pursuits,\" has been expanded to \"Agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry,\" and :fishermen and oystermen have been transferred from \"Manufacturing and mechanical pursuits\" to this division The mining and quarrying industries have been transferred from \"Manufacturing and mechanical pursuits\" to the new division, \"Extraction of minerals\" The title of the old division, \"Manufacturing and mechanical pursuits,\" has been changed to \"Manufacturing and mechanical industries\" The old division, \"T;tade and transportation,\" has been separated into its two parts, \"Trade\" and \"Transportation,\" and all public service occupations not elsewhere classified have been brought together under a new division, \"Public service\" Since the Federal Government, the states, the counties, and the cities employ persons in a great variety of occupations and in many indust,ries, to attempt to classify all these employees under public service would r~quire much duplication and necessitate the breaking up of numerous occupational groups Therefore, under public service have been classified only those public employees who could not, occupationa1ly, he better dasc;ified elsewhere -The new index to occupationsIn classifying occupations at the Twelfth Census, an index to occupa_ tions, based upon that of the Eleventh Census; was used This index, with approximately 2,600 occupational designations, classed under 475 occupation groups, was entirely inadequate as a guide to the proper classification of the 20,000 or more different occupational designations returned by the enumerators in 1900 It could not be used as a guide to the classification of the returns of 1910, in accordance with the new classification Therefore, a new index to occupations was prepared This index was based primarily on the occupations returned by the enumerators at the Twelfth Census The terms, or designatio?s, actually used by the enumerators in 1900 were copied from the schedules About 15,000 of the most important of these occupational designations were selected穎or the index and were classiiied under the proper industries or ?service groups of the new classification The index thus prepared shows the principal industries returned by the enumerators in 1900, the important occupations returned for each of these industries, and the most usual forms of returning such occupations The new occupations returned in 1910, and the new forms of returning the occupations reported in 1900, have been added to the index, so that it now represents about 17,000 different occupational designations or forms of return But, since, in most cases, any given occupation in an industry may be designated in two or more ways, the total number of occupations listed under the different industries and service groups of the index is much smaller than the number of occupational designations And, since, in many cases, a given process of work and the conditions under which it is performed do not vary sufficiently from one industry to another to constitute the process a different occupation in each industry in which it is pursued, the total number of separate and distinct occupations returned at the Thirteenth Census is very much smaller than the total number listed under the different industries and service groups of the index For example, while the process finishing varies so much from one industry to another that there are a number of distinct occupations, each termed \"finisher,\" as, \":finisher coats,\" \":finisherpianos,\" \"finisher steel rails,\" etc, typewriting is so nearly the same in every business or industry that there is but one occupation termed \"typewriter\" -Method of classifying occupations in 1910Prior to the receipt of the schedules, it was estimated that there would be between 35,000,000 and 40,000,000 persons returned as gainfully occupied It was evident that these millions of occupation returns, collected by the approximately 70,000 enumerators at the Thirteenth Census, would have to be classified before they could be reported in any scientific manner It was certain, moreover, that many of the occupations would be returned in such indefinite form that their classification would be difficult Hence, it was deemed inad-visable to intrust the classification of all the occupation returns to the regular punching clerks, who were to punch on cards 1 the numerous facts contained in the 27 other columns of the population schedule On the other hand, it was equally inadvisable to provide a special force to classify all the occupation returns before this information was transferred to the punch cards Therefore, the work was divided between the regular punching clerks and a special classifying force A brief list of occupational designations, containing those occupation terms which it was thought would be returned most definitely and most frequently, was prepared for the use of the punching clerks The proper classification of each of these designations was indicated by a punch symbol The punching clerks were then instructed to pu_nch only those occupational designations returned on the schedules for which they found exact duplicates in the list For all indefinite forms of these designations, and for all other designations, they were instructed to punch \"Ot,\" meaning other occupations These \"Ot\" occupations, comprising a total of more than 21,000,000 occupation returns, were reserved for examination and classification by a special classifying force -The force for classifying the \"6t\" occupations was divided into small sections, each containing from six to ten clerks under competent supervision These clerks, each using a copy of the index to occupations, examined the schedules and assigned a punch symbol to each\" Ot\" occupational designation covered by the index The \"Ot\" designations not covered by the index, as well as all doubtful cases, were referred to the section chief for classification and assignment of symbols All available directories and reports were used as aids in classifying, and frequent reference was made to the Thirteenth Census schedules for manufactures and mines The punch symbols were written on the schedules by the classifying clerks and later were punched in the cards The cards were then sorted mechanically by industry and by occupation, and before tabulation the following classes of cards were compared with the original population schedules and the proper corrections made: All cards for females in occupations not usually followed by females, all cards for occupations very unusual in the industry, and all cards for either sex in any industry in which the sex was represented by three?persons or less in the tabulation area After the cards were tabulated, further comparisons and corrections were made in cases of peculiar and unusual occupations, especially where children under 16 years of age were represented as working in occupations thought to be impossible or unusual for persons so young But an error in the statement of the sex, age, or occupation of a person could not be detected, -1 At the Thirteenth Census a separate card waa used for each person enumerated, to which was tpnsferred _by punching, f_pr purpo!>es of later tabulation by electrical machmes: all the mformat10n returned on the population schedule concernmg the color, sex, age, nativity, occupation, etc, of the person -unless it was inconsistent with the other information returned on the schedule for this same person ?Most of the cases in which women and children are reported as working at occupations very unusual for such persons probably are the result of such undetected errors -Inherent difficulties in classifying occupationsCertain inherent difficulties make absolutely accurate classification of occupations impossible, and, hence, preclude the possibility of absolutely accurate occupation statistics First, is the impossibility of making a classification of occupations sufficiently broad and sufficiently detailed to cover all the various activities of the millions of gainful workers in a country with great diversification of industries and with minute division of labor in each industry Second, is the difficulty due to the great complexity of present day industries and industrial establishments In many cases there is today no definite line of demarcation between industries; and, consequently, processes which generally are considered as belonging to separate and di3tinct industries frequently are performed in one and the same establishment This makes it impossible in many cases to determine in which of two closely related industries a given person works, and, hence, makes it impossible to classify all workers properly, according to any definite and logical scheme Inshort, the difficulty here is that which results from the necessary attempt to reduce to a fixed and definite classification the workers in an industrial system the organization of which is not only complex but constantly changing Third, is the impossibility of classifying with complete accuracy occupations which in reality are not clearcut and well defined Formerly, under the guild system, to a large degree each workman had a definite occupation or trade, as, cooper, tailor, shoemaker, etc; but with the transition to the factory system, and the great division of labor which accompanies it, the tendency has been for each of these old handicraft trades to give place to a number of specific processes in the manufacture of the same article The transition is still in progress, so that today a workman may make the whole of an article, or perform several of the processes in its manufacture, or perform only one of them Moreover, the nature of the processes is -changing continually This indefiniteness in certain occupations makes their accurate return and classification impossible; and this indefiniteness will remain so long as new processes in manufactming are being devised -Practical difficulties in classifying occupationsIn addition to these inherent difficulties, due to the nature of present day industrial organization and, hence, ineradicable, there were, at the Thirteenth Census numerous practical difficulties which, though not in- herent and not ineradicable, were, nevertheless, even greater hindrances i:n the proper classification of occupations and in the securing of accurate occupation statistics The source of each of these practical difficulties was the samepoor enumeration In part, this poor enumeration was <lue to the great difficulty of securing absolutely correct returns from persons who are ignorant, indifferent, or not trained in making accurate statement, or who, as a matter of fact, do not know the precise nature of the occupations followed by persons other than themselves, as was the case with some of those who furnished information to the enumerators; but, in the main, it was due to the carelessness or inefficiency of the enumerators themselves Their principal errors were: The use of general and indefinite terms; the failure to return for each gainful worker both the occupation and the industry in which it was pursued; the failure to make any return in the occupation columns of the schedule; the return of \"None\" for persons who evidently were gainfully employed; the return of occupations for persons who evidently were not gainfully employed; the use of stereotyped forms of return, without proper regard to the facts in the individual cases; and the errors due to the misinterpretation of their instructions The returns of the majority of the enumerators were largely free from these errors; the returns of many of the others were defective in respect to only a part of them; and in case of the returns of only a small minority of the enumerators were they numerous On the whole, these faulty returns did not constitute a large percentage of the entire number The most important of them, the degree of success in classifying them, and their effect on the accuracy of the statistics are discussed in the following paragraphs -Farmers and farm laborersIn 1910, as in 1900, occasionally an enumerator did not distinguish carefully between \"farmers\" and \"farm laborers,\" but returned all farm workers indiscriminately as the one or the other From the evidence in the other columns of the schedule, the classifiers were able to correct roost of these errors The number of such errors that could not be so corrected was comparatively small in each case, and it is probable that in any area for which occupation statistics are reported they, to a large extent, balance each other -\"Laborer odd jobs,\" etcA frequent form of return in 1910 was \"Laborer odd jobs/ \"Odd jobs/ or \"Working out,\" with no statement as to whether the person so returned worked on a farm or elsewhere In classifying such returns, the persons were considered to be farm laborers if they lived in unincorporated places and there was no evidence that they were workingin construction gaJigs,lumber camps, orat other nonagricultural work It is believed that through the operationof this rule most of these errors were corrected -farms for their own parents as farm laborershome farm, and to return children at work on farIDB for others as farm laborersJ/l)orking outi but many of them failed to make these distinctions carefully Quite frequently, the young children of a farmer were enumerated with the home family, but were returned in the occupation columns merely as laborersfarm The classifying clerks were instructed to consider such children, when they were under 16 years of age, as being laborers on the home farm; but, as a large percentage of such returns were punched before the schedules were edited, the attempted division of children returned as farm laborers into farm laborershome farm and farm 7aborersworking out was not very succe&sful -Number of children in agricultural pursuits,During the decade 1900 to 1910 the increase in the number of children 10 to 15 years of age returned as engaged in agricultural pursuits, especially the increase in the number of females returned as agricultural laborers, was so great as to seem excessive A careful analysis of the figures (see p 28 for a full discussion) indicates that during this period there was no such marked increase in 穞;he number of children actually engaged in agricultural pursuits, and that the apparent great increase was, to a large extent, the result of a difference in the basis of enumeration at the two ce))Suses, due to a difference :in the instructions to the enumerators It is probable that the Thirteenth Ce:,,1sus enumerators, construing their instructions closely, enumerated as gainful workers farm children who would not have been so enumerated by the Twelfth Census enumerators -Number of women in agricultural pursuitsThe increase from HlOO to 1910 in the number of women returned as engaged in agricultural pursuits was quite marked, being especially large in the case of wome;n returned as farm laborers working on the home farm As suggested elsewhere (seep 27 for a full discussion), it is quite probable that this great increase was in part abnormal and was due, primarily, to the difference :in the instructions to the enumerators at the two censuses, rather than to any great increase in the proportion of women actually engaged in agricultural pursuits -ApprenticesSince in classifying occupations it was impracticable to assign a separate occupation symbol to each kind of apprentice in each of the different :industries, all the apprentices in each respective industry, except in t,he building alld hand trades, were classified under the same occupation symbol The resultant group of apprentices in each industry is not as specific as is desfrable, and those apprentices to the building and hand trades who were employed in other industries are reported u:nde1?those industries and not with\" apprentices to building and hand trades\" -Brass foundry and iron foundry employees,The effort to distinguish the employees in brass foundries from the employees in iron foundries was not very successful in places where both brass foundries and iron foundries were located, for, frequently, the returns were merely \"Laborerfoundry,\" \"Molderfoundry,\" etc, without further specification The employees  in brass foundries were chissi:fied with the employees in \"Brass mills;\" and the returns which could not be distinguished as belonging either to brass foundries or to iron foundries were classified under \"Not specified metal industries\" -Brick, tile, and terracotta factory employeesAn effort was made to distinguish the workers in brick factories, tile factories, and terra ootta factories, respectively; but this effort met with little success because of the fact that today some factories manufacture both brick and tile, and others manufacture both tile and terracotta No attempt is made, therefore, to present separate occupation statistics for each of these three industries It is believed, however, that the occupation statistics reported for the combined industries are approximately correct -Builders and building _contraotorsXotwithstanding the effort made to classify as \"Builders and building contractors 11 only those persons occupied principally in making and carrying out building contracts, and to classify with their respective trades, as carpenters, masons, plasterers, etc, all persons working with their tools, it is believed that the number of \"Builders and building contractors\" is far too large -Car shop imd railroad repair shop employeesMuch difficulty was experienced in the effort to distinguish the employees of railroad car repair shops from the employees of car building shops, and often this distinction could not be made with certainty In fact, it is believed that many of the employees of railroad car repair shops were classified with and are reported as employees of car building shops However, since the occupations are much the same in the two kinds of shops1 this failure to keep them separate is not of great consequence occupationally The industry totals, howevfr, are rendered inaccurate to the extent of the unbalanced error in the classification of the occupations -Cigar factory and tobacco factory employeesSince many of the enumerators did not distinguish carefully between the operatives in cigar factories and the operatives in tobacco factories, the occupations in these two industries have been combined It is believed that the occupation statistics for tho combined industries are approximately correct -Clothing factory employeesIt was frequently difficult to distinguish the makers of \"suits, coats, cloaks and overalls\" from the makers of other cloth-garments; and often, also, difficulty was experience in distinguishing between the makers of ~loth garments and knit garments, and between the knitters of cotton -and woolen garments and the workBrs in cotton aud woolen mills Furthermore, in many cases it was hard to distinguish the makers of cloth and knit gloves from the makers of leather gloves -lland sewers and sewing machine operators,Since the enumeratcus did not distinguish carefully between the hand sewers and the sewing machine operators in factories, it has been necessary to combine them under one head -Iron foundry and iron manllfaotory employeesAn effort was made to distinguish the employees <,f iron foundries from the employees of other establishments engaged in the remanufacture of iron and steel, hut so many of the machine shops and factories engaged in the manufacture of implements, machinery, etc, had iron foundries connected with them that a close distinction was impossible -effort was made to distinguish the employees of, blast furnaces and steelrolling millsthe mills which manufacture and roll iron and steelfrom the employees of the factories which remanufacture iron and steel into hardware, implements, machinery, etc, hut this effort was not entirely successful, In the first place, many of the enumerators, where they could have done so, failed to distinguish between steel mills and the factories which remanufacture iron and steel In the second place, the enumerators often found it impossible to specify a given establishment either as a steelrolling mill or as a factory engaged in the remanufacture of iron and steel, for it was both The fact that toclay the steel industry is not clearcut and distinct, but frequently overlaps the iron and steel remanuf acturing industries, often makes impossible the return of the specific industry in which the employees of a given establishment work, and hence renders impossible their exact classification according to industry Notwithstanding these 1lifficulties, it is believed that a large proportion of the workers in the steel industry have been properly classified; and, since they work under such peculiar conditions, it was thought best to report them separately -number of cases in which the enumerators failed to distin~ish the operatives in paper box factories from the operatives in wooden box factories amounted fo approximately onethird of the total There is, therefore, a very large percentage of error in the statistics of occupations reported for each of these two industries -Paper mill and pulp mill employees,The enumerators failed to distinguish between paper mills and pulp mills so generally that no attempt has been made to report separate statistics for the occupations in each of these two industries -! !  Not specified mine employeesSome of the enumerators, in returning the occupations of mine employees, neglected to state the kind of mum, as copper, iron, gold, etc In a district in which only one mineral -is mined such returns could be classified under the proper industry, but in a district in which two or more minerals are mined it was necessary to classify them under \"Not specified mines\" In returning the occupations of the employees of those mines from which two or more minerals are extracted in about equal proportions, as copper and silver, silver and llad, the enumerators could not specify a particular kind of mine It was necessary, therefore, to classify these returns also under \"Not specified mines\" From the foregoing it is evident that the 31,712 returns of workers of all kinds classified under \"Not specified mines\" did not come from the different mining states in the same proportions as the total number of mine workers returned, but in the main came from those states in which two or more minerals are mined in close proximity, or in which two or more minerals are extracted from the same mine These, in general, are the mining states west of the Mississippi River antl :Michigan -Occupations in not specified industries,In those cases in which enumerators returned occupations without stating in what industries they were pul:Sued, it was impossible to classify the returns under any specified iJ1dustry In case of mining occupations, metalworking occupations, and textile~mill occupations usually it was possible to determine to what group of related industries the different returns belonged, and in such cases they were classified, respectively, under \"Not specified mines/ \"Not specified metal industries,\" and \"Not specified textile mills\" 1 Bpt in many of the cases it was possible to determine only that the occupations were pursued in manufacturing industries These were classified under \"Other not specified industries\" In still other cases it was impossible to determine anything in regard to the industries in which the occupations were pursued These were classified under \"Occupations in not specified industries and service groups\" -Specified occupations returned under trade namesIn all those cases in which hand trades, through the introduction of machinery, the multiplication of processes, and the division of labor, have rather recently developed into factory industries, there was a marked tendency for the operatives to give the old trade names as their occupations, rather than the names of the  specific processes they were performing In some industries a large percentage of the operatives were returned under these trade designations This was especially true in bakeries, candy factories, cigar factories, harness factories, hat factories, jtwelry factories, shoe factories, and clothhig factories As a result, the number <if bakers, randy makers, cigar makers, harness makers, hatters, jewelers (factory}, shoemakers (factory), and tailors and tailoresses is excessive Sometimes the proprietors in such industries were returned under the old trade designations, as brewers, -millers, tanners, etc; but usually these returns could be properly classified, since the persons were returned as employers ?-Clerks in stores and salesmenAlthough instructed specifically to the contrary, many of the Thirteenth Census enumerators failed utterlyas did the enumerators at preceding censusesto distinguish between the clerks and the salesmen employed in wholesale and retail trade The tendency was to return salesmen as clerks, although their duties were in no sense clerical As a result, the statistics reporting the number in each of these occupations, respectively, are far from accurate This is indicated by the fact that the number of salesmen and saleswomen reported is less than threefourths the number of wholesale and retail merchants and dealers, and by the further fact that there are reported more than two clerks in stores for each five salesmen and saleswomen Similar figures were reported at the Twelfth Census -Locomotive engineers and firemenThe 積numerators did not always distinguish carefully between locomotive engineers and the stationary engineers employed by railroads, or between locomotive firemen and the other firemen employed by railroads; and the large number of locomotive engineers and of locomotive firemen?reported for 1910 indicates that, even after such corrections as could be made, some stationary engineers are included with the locomotive engineers and some other firemen are included with the locomoti\"ve firemen -Railroad brakemenThe number of railroad brakemen is entirely too small as compared with the number of locomotive engineers andfiremen This probably is due to the return of brakemen under certain general designations -Steam and street railroad employeesThe enumerators in their returns did not always specify the employees of street railways as such, and it is probable, therefore, that some of these were classified with and havfl been reported as employees of steam railroads However, it is not believed that the number of such cases is large enough to affect the statistics perceptibly -Cooks and general servantsIn the occupation returns, especially the returns for the colored females of the South, there was not a careful distinction made between cooks and general servonts As a result, in some areas the fem ale cooks far outnumbered the general servants, and in the United States as a whole there was more than one female cook to each three female general servants The returns for the male cooks and servants were much better than for the -females Housekeepers and stewardsNotwithstanding the fact that the enumerators were given specific instruc-tions to return as housekeepers only those women who were keeping house for salaries or wages, so many of them returned as housekeepers housewives doing housework in their own homes, without salaries or wages, and servants who were in no sense housekeepers, that, after a rigid exclusion of the most improbable cases, it is certain that so many housewives and servants are included under the head of housekeepers as to render the statistics very inaccurate At the census of 1910, as at the preceding, there were reported more housekeepers and stewards than waiters, and more than one housekeeper or steward to each ten general servants -NursesAn effort was made to separate the trained nurses from the practical or untrained nurses, and to exclude from both groups nursemaids and childrens nurses It is believed, however, that a considerable number of nursemaids and childrens nurses were includ~d with the other nurses; and the effort to classify separately the trained and the practical nurses was not very successful Therefore, the enormous increase from 1900 to 1910 iri the number of trained nurses may be in part apparent only -Inmates of institutions,At the Twelfth Census only such of the inmates of institutionsasylums, homes, hospitals, jails, penitentiaries, etcas were actually engaged in remunerative work for which they received stated wages in addition to their board were returned as gainfully occupied At the Thirteenth Census all inmates of such institutions who were regularly employed, whether at productive labor or at other duties, such as cooking, scrubbing, laundry work, etc, were returned as gainfully occupied The inclusion, in 1910, of all the gainfully occupied inmates of institutions, as against the inclusion, in 1900, of only those inmates who received wages in addition to their board, has contributed many thousands to the number of persons reported as gainfully occupied in the United States1 In returning occupations for the inmates of institutions, some of the enumerators returned former occupations an<l not the ones being pursued in the institutions This fact made it difficult to classify these returns properly -Peculiar occupations for womenThe Thirteenth Census enumerators, like the enumerators at previous censuses, returned women as following many occupations which are very peculiar and unusual for women -1 There are no available Federal statistics from which can be made even an approximate estimate of the total number of i~mates in institutions engaged in gainful occupations A rough estimate, based on the most recent Feaeral statistics showing !he number of prisoners and juvenile delinquents and the prnport1on of them gamfully occupied, indicates thatprobahly from 80,000 to 90,000 sueh persons were engagerl_in gai~ful_ oc1;upations in 1910?The number of inmates of charitable mst1tut10ns, almshouses, 111~ane ruiyluma, and asylums for the feeblemfn~ed who _were engaged iu g11inf\\ue672 occupations probably was sufficient to brmg the !otal number of mmates of institutions engaged in gainful occupat10ns at the date of the Thirteenth Census up to or above 100,000 -A careful examination of the schedules in such cases usually showed that errors had been made in the return, either of the sex: or of the occupation Most of these errors were found and corrected by the classifying clerks Others were corrected during the work of :final revision Occasionally, however, no such errors were apparent on the schedules These cases are reported, although itis probable that inmostinstances the women did not actually follow the occupations returned for them The following are examples of such occupations: -Soldiers, sailors, and marines,An effort was made to classify separately each of the special occupations followed by the enlisted men of the army and the navy, as blacksmith, teamster, fireman, machinist, etc; but so many of the enumerators had failed to make such distinctions that this effort was not successful Therefore, the enlisted men of the army and the navy are reported only as soldiers, sailors, and marines -Two occupations for same personThe enumerators were instructed that in case a person had two occupations they should return only the more important onethat fa, the one from which the person got the more money In case an enumerator did return two occupations for the same person, it was the rule of the office to consider only the firstnamed occupation -Women musicians and teachers of mnsicOf the large number of women classed as mUBicians or teachers of music, it is probable that many did not spend a large proportion of their time at the occupation -Scope of reportIn a country where the occupations are so numerous as in the United States, it fa impossible to present, in a single volume of moderate size, all the occupation statistics for which statisticians and others may have need The original plans for the occupation report contemplated such a selection of occupation tables that the chief statistical facts in connection with occupations would be shown, in one?table or another, and in such form that the static;tical facts of less importance could be derived from them easily But this plan could not be carried out In the :first place, because of a lack of funds, -the work on occupations was practically stopped for an entire year during the regular census period When it was again resumed and the first and simpler of the two contemplated machine counts of the occupation cards was almost completed, it was decided that, since the Thirteenth Census period had elapsed and since regular annual reports and other work of the intercensal period were being greatly delayed by the employment of the census clerks upon the Thirteenth Census work, it was best to abandon the second machine count_ of the occupation _ cards and to limit the scope of the occupation report -The limitation of the scope of the present report to the results of the first count of occupations has made necessary the omission of contemplated statistics on -1 This decision was made in compliance with the recolllillendations of a special arlvisory committee on the work of the census The members of this committee were Hon S N D North and Hon William R Merriam, former Directors of the Census; Prof Walter F \"Willcox, of Cornell Univernity; Mr _W S Rossiter, formerly Chief Clerk of the Census; and Hon Daniel C Roper, First Assistant Postmaster General, and formerly an official of the Census Bureau -the following subjects: Unemployment, marital condition of persons engaged in gainful occupations, countries of birth of foreignborn gainful workers, age distribution of gainful workers by five or ten year periods, and class of workerthat is, whether the worker was an employer, an employee, or was working on his own account Statistics on each of these subjects will be presented in a special report on occupations to be published later -Description of general tables,The present report, under the above plan, contains 9 general tables, as follows: -Table I (p 91) shows, for the United States, the number and sex of the persons 10 years of age and over engaged in 1910 in each of 428 specified occupations and occupation groups, representing combinations of the elementary occupations shown in Table VI Similar statistics are presented for each state and for the District of Columbia in Table II (p 96) and for each city of 100,000 inhabitants or more inTable III (p 152) -Table V (p 292) shows, for each of the outlying territories of Alaska, Hawaii, and Porto Rico, and also separately for the cities of Honolulu, in Hawaii, and Ca:,<71las, Mayaguez, Ponce, and San Juan, in Porto Rico, tho number and sex of the persons 10 years of age and over engaged in each important occupation and occupation group in 1910 In the table for each separate area, the 215 occupations and occupation groups of Table I are shown so far as they were appli-operatives in candy factories, etc These residuary groups, while not strictly occupational, have a great , deal of occupational significance; for, although each of them is made up of the workers in numerous occupations pursued, sometimes, in several different industries, these workers together form a group which, in many respects, is occupationally homogeneous, Since the proprietors, the officials, the supervisory persons, the clerical workers, the followers of trades, and the laborers are otherwise classified, all the persons included in each of the residuary groups shown under \"Manufacturing and mechanical industries,\" are factory operatives belonging to iJie semiskilled class In each extractive industry the nature of the returns were -Thus, so far as practicable, the combination of the elementary occupations of lahle VI has been along occupational rather than industrial lines Each oecupation of the condensed list is classified in that part of the industrial field in which it is most commonly pursued For example, blacksmiths, carpenters, electricians, and machinists have been classified under\" :Manufacturing and mechanical industries,\" although each of these trades is pursued in almost every industry Clerical occupations, which can hardly be sai1l to be more common to one general division of occupations than to another, have been classified apart -The comparisons and discussions of this chapter are confined to the results of the censuses of 1880, 1890, 1900, and 1910 In 1880, 1890, and 1900 the occupation returns had reference only to gainfully occupied persons 10 years of age and over In 1910 the enumerators were instructed to include all persons gainfully occupied, irrespective of age, but the returns for persons under 10 years of age are not covered by the stati3tics presented in this volume At each of these censuses, then, the occupation statistics refer only to gainfully occupied persons 10 years of age and over Before comparing the statistics of 1910 with those of preceding censuses, it is essential to establish, as nearly as possible, the relative sufficiency of the occupation returns -GEOGRAPIDC DIYJSIONS: New England Middle Atlantic?晻 East North Central 晻晻?West North Central??

and in the selected agricultural states outside the South the increase ranged from 1549 per cent in Kansas to -4714 per cent in Wisconsin and to 527 per cent in North Dakota These percentage increases are useful mainly, however, to show that the great increase from 1900 to 1910 in female farm laborers was general throughout the United States and was not confined to children or to negroes Numerically, however, it is a fact that a large proportion of this increase was confined to the South, to the negroes, and to children 10 to 15 years of age -2 In Alabama, Georgia, :Mississippi, and South Carolina, in 1910, the number of female farm laborers working on the home farm outnumbered themales (see Tables IIand VII, pp 96 and 434); and in Alabama, Mississippi, and South Carolina, the excess of females over males was so great that there was actually an excess of females over males in the tow1number of farm laborers Also, in Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, and TeXll8, the number of female farm laborers on the home farm approached the number of males rather closely In each of these nine states the number of male farm laborers on the home farm exceeded the females in each of the three lowest age periodsIO to 13, 14 to 15, and 16 to 20but in each of the two highest age periods21 to 44, and 45 years and overthe female farm laborers on the home farm greatly outnumbered the males in each state In each of thcie nine states too the number of negro female farm laborers on the home farm greatiy exceeded the number of males The figures indicate that a lame proportion of the adult negro males working on the home fa~ were returned as \"farmers,\" while most of the adult negro females working on the home farm were returned as \"farm -aThe selected southern agricultural states are: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida Georgia Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina  Tennessee, Texas, and Virgmia The selected agricultural states outside ?f ~he Sou~h are: California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, M1ch1gan, _Mmn::lsota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and W1Sconam, -537 pel cent of the increase in the total number was confined to negro females, Furthermore, there was an increase from 1900 to 1910 of 202,839 in the number of female agricultural laborers 10 to 15 years of age, which was 236 per cent of tho total increase in the number of femala agricultural laborers, Of this increase of 202,839 in the number of female agricultural laborers 1 O to 15 years of age, 915 per cent was confined to the 12 selected southern agricultural states ~nd 8l6 per cent to 7 southern agricultural statesAlabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi1 North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas, There is no doubt that between the Twelfth Census and the Thirteenth Census the:re was a grea,t inc:rease in the proportion of women 10 years of t1,ge and over actually engaged in gainful occupations, and it is quite probable thl\\\\it the proportion increased more rapidly during this decade th11,D during any preceding decade; but the a,bove analysis indicates that a part of the great increase reported for the decade 1900 to 1910 was apparent only and waa due to a difference in the instructions to enumerators at the two censuses, rather than to so marked an increase in the proportion of women actually engaged in gainful labor, This (Lna,lysis indicates further that, while the number of women returned as engaged in a~cultural pursuits was affected most by these differences in the instruc~ tions to the enumerators, the number of women returned as?engaged in other pursuits probably was affeoted by them to some extent -It is impossible, of course, to measure exactly the extent to which the number of females returned as engaged in gainful occupations in 1910 probably was increased by the changes in the instructions to enu?merat9rs, referred to above But if, for the moment, it be assumed that outside of agricultural pursuits the returns were not affected perceptibly, it may ~ possible to approximate roughly any excess in the number offemales returned as engaged in agricultural pursuits The small increase from 1900 to 1910 in t,he number of males engaged in agricultural pursuits, -144 per cent, and in the number of farms, 109 per cent, suggests that probably there was no gi積at increase during this period in the number of females engaged in agricultural pursuits, end, henoe, probttbly no marked increase in the proportion whioh females engaged in agricultural pursuits constituted of all gainfully occupied females An examination of the proportion which females engaged in agricultural pursuits constituted of all gainfully occupied females at each of the censuses 1880, 1890, and 1900 lends strength to this suggestion In 1880 females engaged in agricultural pursuits constituted 225 per cent of 11,ll gainfully occupied females; in 1890 this proportion had fallen to 192 per cent, and, in 1900, to 18,4 per cent If the decrcase in the proportion of gainfully occupied females engaged in agricultural pursuits was the same from 1900 to 1910 as it was from 1890 to 1900, then only 176 per cent of all gainfully occupied females in 1910 were actually engaged in agricultural pursuits According to this estimate, the number of females engaged in agricultural pursuits in 1910 would have been 1,338,950 instead of 1,807,050, as reported, and the total number of females gainfully occ11pied in 1910 would have been 7,607,672 instead of 8,0751772, as reported Also, according to this estimate, the proportion of all fernales gainfully occupied in 1910 would have been 17 per cent instead of _181?per cent, aa reported; and the proportion of females 10 yeani of age and over engaged in gainful occupations in 1910 would have been 22 per cent instead of 234 per cent1 -as reported Furthermore, the proportion of gainful workers in the total population would have been 41 per cent instead of 415 per cent, as reported, and the proportion of gainful workers in the population 10 years of age and over would have been 527 per cent instead of 533 per oent, as reported -While the above is but a rough approximation, the analysis indicates strongly that a reduction of 468,100 in the number of :females returned as engaged in  agricultural pursuits would not be excessive At lettst, itis very probable that a reduction of 468,100 in the total number of females engaged in all occupations would not be excessive, and, hence, that not over 17 per cent of all females and not over 22 per cent of the females 10 years of age and over were engaged in gainful occupations in 1910 Even these reduced proportions would show a considerably greater increase from 1900 to 1910 than during either of the two preceding decades, both in the proportion of all females and in the proportion of females 10 years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations -144 Column 18 Trade or profesBionAn entry should be made in this column for every person enumerated The occupation, if any, followed by a child, of any age, or by a woman is just M im?portant, for census purposes, aa the occupation followed by a man Therefore it muat never be taken for granted, without inquiry, that a woman, or child, has no occupation The effect, if any, of such an instruction upon the returns of the enumerators probably would be more marked in the case of children working at agricultural pursuits than in case of children working at other pursuits Children who work at nonagricultural pursuits commonly work away from home and for wages, and, hence, probably their occupations were quite generally returned at previous censuses In agriculture, a large proportion of the children work for their parents and without wages; and, since their work varies from doing a few errands or chores to field work regularly performed, the enumerator must of necessity draw the line between the gainful and the nongainful workers The efl\\\\1ct, if any, of the above instruction on this point probably was to cause him t~ include a larger proportion of the farm children among the gainful workers than otherwise he would have done In addition, he was given the following special instruction in regard to the return of the occupations of children working on farms: -155 Children onfarmsln caae of children who work for their own parents on a farm, the entry in column 18 should be/arm laborer andin column19 home/arm; butfor children who work aa farm labor?ers for others, the entry in column 19 should be working out The instruction that occupations should not be returned for children working for their parents at chores, errands, or general household work was practically the same in 1900 and 1910 On the whole, however, it may be asserted that at the Thirteenth Census much -more emphasis was placed upon the instruction to return an occupation for every child gainfully occupied than was the case at the Twelfth Census It may be, then, that during the decade 1900 to 1910 there was no marked increase in the number of children actually: engaged in agricultmal pursuits, and that the apparent increase was due mainly to the enumeration as gainful workers in 1910 of farm children doing chores or performing other light tasks not considered gainful occupations in 1900 It can not be asserted with assurance, however, that the Twelfth Census enumerators failed generally to enumerate as gainful workers farm children who should have been so enumerated, or that the Thirteenth Census enumerators generally enumerated as gainful workers farm children who should not have been so enumerated; but the evidence here presented indicates that the great increase from 1900 to 1910 in the number of children returned as engaged in agricultural pursuits was due to a difference in the basis of enumeration at the two censuses, rather than to any actual increase in the number at work -194 per cent for the males and 981 per cent for the females Thus, the great percentage increase from 1900 to 1910 in the number of children 10 to 15 years of age engaged in agricultural pursuits was confined mainly to female agricultural laborers, the number of which increased 202,839 As stated in the :first paragraph on page 28, 915 per cent of this increase of 202J839 was in 12 selected agricultural states of the South; and 816 per cent of it was in seven agricultural states of the SouthAlabama, Arkansas, Georgia, 1Iississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas However, the percentage increase in female agricultural laborers 10 to 15 years of age, as distinguished from the numerical increase, was far less in the 12 selected agricultural states of the South than in the remaining states, the respective perc~ntages being 931 and 2343 In the 12 selected agricultural states of the South the percentage increase from 1900 to 1910 in female agricultural laborers 10 to 15 years of age varied from 29 per cent in Louisiana to 2335 per cent in Kentucky and to 2849 per cent in Texas )!or the male agricultural laborers 10 to 15 years of age, the percentage increase from 1900 to 1910 was considerably greater in the 12 selected agricultural states of the South than in the remaining states, the respective percentages being 26,il and 41 In the 12 selected southern states the increase varied from threetenths of 1 per cent in Louisiana to 622 per cent in Texas \\x0cPOPULATION -United StatesAt the Thirteenth Census, in 1910, there were 38,756,223 persons 10 years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations in the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, Porto Rico, and the military and naval stations abroad The gainful workers thus formed 415 per cent of the total population enumer- ated at that census In this report, as in other Thirteenth Censmi reports, the term \"United States\" when used without qualification embraces the 48 states and the District of Columbia but not the outlying territories and possessions of the United States Sometimes, however, the United States in this sense is refened to as the United States proper, or as continental United States -In continental United States the gainful workers numbered 38,167,336, which was 415 per cent of the total population an<l 533 per cent of the population 10 years of age and over In the male population the gainful workers numbered 30,091,564, which was 636 per cent of all males and 813 per cent of the males 10 years of age and over In the female population the gainful workers numbered 8,075,772, which was 181 per cent of all females and 234 per cent of the females 10 years of age and over Thus, in the total population, over twofilths of all persons, considerably over threefilths of all the males, but considerably less than onefilth of all the females, were engaged in gainful occupations in 1910; and in the population 10 years of age and over, more tpan onehalf of all persons, over fourfilths of the males, but less than onefourth of the females, were gainfully occupied In other words, of all persons 10 years of age and over :in 19101 more than every other one had a gainful occupation, of the males over four out of five were gainful workers, and of the females almost one out of four was a gainful worker -the increase being least rapiu from 1890 to 1900 and most rapid from 1900 to 1910 In the male population 10 years of age and over the proportion gainfully occupied increased gradually from 787 per cent in 1880 to 813 per cent :in 1910, while that of gainful workers in the female population 10 years of age and over increased from 147 to 234 per cent The increase for males was considerably greater from 1900 to 1910 than for either of the two preceding decades, while for females it was much less rnpid from 1890 to 1900 than during the preceding decade, but was quite marked from 1900 to 1910 After making full allowance for a possible excess in the number of females reported at work in 1910, the increase in the proportion of fem ales 10 years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations appears to have been much greater during the decade 1900 to 1910 than during eit1;ier of the two preceding decades -1 Figures for 1890 am exclusive of persons in Indian Territorv and on Indian reservations, areas specially enumerated at that census, but !or which occupation stati~tics are not available -Table 3 shows that in 1910 persons 10 years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations formed 415 per cent of the total population of the United States, and that in the different geographic divisions the proportion of gainful workers 穒n the population varied from 382 per cent in the West North Central to 461 per cent in the Pacific division In the East North Central, the West North Central, and the West South Central divisions the proportion gainfully occupied was smaller than in the United States as a whole, while in each of the other geographic divisions the -proportion was larger than in the Unitecl States as a whole In each geographic division, however, the proportion of the population engaged in gainful occu pations was greater in 1910 than in moo, the increase being much larger in the southern section of the United Statesthat part included in the South Atlantic, the East South Central, and the West South Central divisionsthan in the northern and western sections New England showed the smallest increase in the proportion gainfully occupiedfrom 425 per cent in 1900 to 445 per cent in 1910and the East South Central division the largest increascfrom 383 per cent in 1900 to 428 per cent in 1910 -In the states the proportion of the total population engaged in gainful occupations in 1910 varied from -Table 4 shows that, while in the United States as a whole 533 per cent of all persons 10 years of age and over in 1910 were engaged in gainful occupations, in the geographic divisions this proportion varied from -489 per cent in the West North Central to 583 per cent in the East South Central division In each division the proportion was higher in 1910 than in 1900, the increase being greatest in the South Atlantic and East South Central divisions and smallest in the West North Central and Mountain divisions In the states, the proportion of the population 10 years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations fu 1910 ranged from 469 per cent in Iowa to 68 per cent in Mississippi Thestates having the?smallest proportions were Iowa, 469 per cent; Kansas, 47 per cent; Nebraska~ 477 per cent; Utah, 479 per cent; and Indiana, 48 per cent The states having the largest proportions were North Carolina, 60 per -Differences in the proportion of the population engaged in gainful occupations usually result from differences either in the sex or the age composition of the population, in the proportion of foreign born or of negroes in the population, in the proportion of the population living in urban areas, or in the industrial activities of the people In the states, the proportion of gainful workers in the population usually is larger for males than for females, for adults than for children, for negroes than for white people, for the foreign~born white than for the native white people, for urban than for rural dwellers, and for m1mufacturing and trading than for agricultural communities In the discussion of Table 5 (p 36), which shows for each geographic division and for each state the proportion of the males 10 years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations in 1910, and in the discussion of Table 6 (p 37), which shows similar :figures for females, marked differcnces in proportions are pointed nut and the most probable causes fnr them are given -10 years of age and over wassmaller, and the proportion 穙f the male population living in cities was smaller than was the case in the other New England states In each of the three states of theMiddleAtlantic division more than eight out of every ten males 10 years -of age and over were gainfully occupied in 1910, the proportion in each state being practically the same as in the United States In New Jersey the proportion was slightly smaller, and in New York and Pennsylvania slightly larger, than in 1900 -In the states comprising the East North Central and the West N ori;h Central divisions the proportion of the males 10 years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations in 1910 variccl from 761 per cent in Iowa to 807 in Missouri In the entire area, and in each of the states which comprise it, the proportion was smaller than in the United States1 and the proportion for the area was also smaller than that for any of the other geographic divisions This ~s largely an agricultural area In 1910 a much smaller proportion of tho population lived in cities, and the proportion of foreign born in the population was smaller than in the New England ~nd Middle Atlantic divisions; the negro population, in which the proportion of gainful workers is larger than in the white population, was small in this area as compared with the area comprised in the South Atlantic, the East South Central, and the West South Central divisions;, and boys 10 to 19 years of age, many of whom do not work, formed a larger proportion of the male population in this area than in the Mountain and the Pacific divisions These facts account for the smaller proportion of gainful workers in the male population 10 years of age and over -In the Southcomprising the South Atlantic, the East South Central, and the West South CeIJtral divisionsconsiderably more than fourfifths of all the males 10 years of age and over were engaged in gainful occupations in 1910, the proportion varying from 796 per cent in the District of Columbia to 883 per cent in Alabama, where it was larger than in any other state of the Union In the main, this is an agricultural area In 1910 only a few of the states had important manufacturing industries, and the amount of trade was small in comparison with the size of the area The population was largely rural and the pioportion of foreign born was small In general, then, the large proportion of gainful workers in the male population 10 years of age and over in this area, and in the different states which comprise it, must be attributed mainly to the large proportion of ncgrocs in the male population In 1910 the proportion of negroes was 331 per cent in the South Atlantic ?division, 31 per cent in the East South Cenfral division, -219 per cent in the West South Central division, and 291 per cent in the entire area The high proportion of gainlul workers in the male population 10 years of age and over in Montana, Wyoming, and Nevada, as compared with theproportion in the other states of the Mountain division, and with the proportion in the United States, is accounted for in part by the small proportion of boys 10 to 19 -years of age in the male population in each of these three states This proportion was exceptionally small in Nevada~104 per cent, as contrasted with 193 , per cent in the entire United States In Wyoming the proportion of old men also was very small; and in Montana the proportion of foreign born in the male population 10 years of age and over was larger than in any other state in this division In 1890, 1900, and 1910, the proportion of gainful workers in the male population 10 years of age and over was smaller in Utah than in any other state of the )fountain divi:lion In 1900 and in1910 boys 10 to 19 years of age formed a larger proportion of the male population in Utah than in any other state of this division; and, both in 1900 and in 1910, tho proportion of boys 10 to 19 years of age engaged in gainful occupations was smaller in Utah than in most of the other states of this division -In each of the three states of the Pacific <livision,;vashington, Oregon, and Californiamore than four out of five of the males 10 years of age and over were engaged in gainful occupations in 1910 This rather high proportion probably was due in part to the low proportion of boys 10 to 19 years of age in the male population -Table 6 (p 37) shows that in the United States in 1910, 234 per cent of the fomales 10 years of age and over were engaged in gainful occupations, and that in the different geographic divisions of the United States this proportion varied from 161 per cent in the West North Central and Mountain divisions to -307 per cent in the East South Central and to 31 per cent in the South Atlantic division In each geographic division there was a marked increase in the proportion from 1900 to 1910, the increase being especially great in the South Atlantic, the East South Central, and the West South Central divisions According to Table 6, there are two sections of the United States in which the proportion of females 10 years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations in 1910 was large The first includes the New England and }fiddle Atlantic cllvisions This is the chief manufacturing and trailing section of the United States and its transportation business is large These activities furnish suitable employment to females The proportion of female workers in this section is increased, also, by the presence of large numbers of foreignborn white women, among whom the proportion of gainful workers is larger than among the native white women Girls 10 to 14 years of age, among whom the proportion of gainful workers usually is small, constituted a smaller proportion of the fem!ilo population in these two divisions than in any other geographic division except the Pacific Furthermore, 11 far larger proportion of the population is urban than in any other section of the United States, and, as already stated, the proportion of gainful workers, especially in the female sex, usually is larger in an urban than in a rural -\\x0cpopulation Tho other section in whhh there is a large proportion of gainful workers in the fonrnle population 10 years of age and over includes the South Atlantic, the East South Central, and tho ,Yest South Central divisions This is the great agritultural (listrict of the South, the region of the cotton plaut11tion, and the homo of tho negro Cotton manufaduring is also important here The plnntations furnish employment to the 1wgro femules, among 穡hom tho proportion of gainful worken;

years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations in 1910 was much higher than in the United States2 The high proportion of gainiul workers in Alaska came from the very high proportion for the male sex, since the proportion for the female sex: was but slightly o,er onehalf as high as in the United States The very high proportion of the males of Alaska engaged in gainful occupations resulted

and over engaged in gainful occupations This increase, however, was confined entirely to the male sex, where it was especially marked In striking contrast to the great increase in the proportion of the males gainfully occupied was the large decrease in the proportion of the females gainfully occupieda decrease from 205 per cent in Hl00 to 93 per cent in 1910 for all females, and from 259 per cent in Hl0O to -124 per cent in 1910 for the females 10 years of age and over This extraordinary decrease resulted largely from the fact that the proportion which Indian females constituted of all females 10 years of age and over decreased from 809 per cent in 1900 to 631 per cent in 1910, together with the fact that the proportion of the occupied Indian females decreased from 282 per cent in 1900 to 87 per cent in 1910 Exclusive of the Indian element, the proportion of the females 10 years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations increased from 16 per cent in 1900 to 189 per cent in 1910 In Hawaii in 1910 the proportion both of the total population and of the population 10 years of age an~ over engaged in gainful occupations was much higher than in the United States2 This difference is accounte<l for partly by the great preponderance of males in the population of Hawaii and partly by the fact that a much larger proportion of the males in Hawaii are in the age period 21 to 44 than is the case in the United States While in the United States in 1910 there were 106 males to each 100 females, in Hawaii there were 1789 males to each 100 females Among the Chinese of Hawaii there were 3789 males to each 100 females, and among the Japanese there were 2201 males to each 100 females Since both in the United States and in Hawaii a much larger proportion of the males than of the females were gainfully occupied in HllO, this great excess of males inthe population of Hawaii accounts in part for the higher proportion of gainful workers in the population In 1910, -375 per cent of the males of the United States were in the age period 21 to 44 years,Swhile 525 per cent of the males of Hawaii were in this age period Since both in the United States and in Hawaii the proportion of gainful workers was highest in the age period 21 to 44, \"the larger proportion of the males in this age period in Tfawaii accounts in part for the higher proportion of gainful workers in the population This also accounts largely for the proportion of gainful workers being so much higher for the males of Hawaii than for the males of the United States In Hawaii in 1910 the proportion of gainful workers was smaller in the total female population but larger in the f emnle population 10 years of age and over than in the United States From 1900 to 1910 there was a decrease in 3

decrease was duo in part to the fact that the number of rnales to each 100 females in the Hawaiian population decreased from 2233 in 1900 to 1789 in 1910, and in part to the fact that the proportion of the males under 15 years of age increased from 168 per cent in 1900 to 235 per cent in 1910 The decrease in the proportion of the population gainfully occupied was confined entirely to the male sex, since from 1900 to 1910 there was a marked increase in foe proportion both of the total female population and of the female population 10 years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations In Porto Rico in 1910 a smaller proportion both of the total population and of the population 10 years of age and over was engaged in gainful occupations than was the case in the United States1 In the

gainful workers in 1910 distributed by general divisions of occupations Since, iri grouping occupations for presentation in the condensed tables of this report, each occupation was classified in that part of the industrial :field in which it is most commonly pursued, this table does not represent the total number of persons occupied in the different industries or service groups of each respective general division pf occupations, but rather the number of persons pursuing the occupations which are most common to each respective general division of occupations Clerical occupations, which are not peculiar to any one of the eight general divisions, are reported here as a separate class According to Table 8, practically onethird (332 per cent) of all gainful workers in the United States in 1910 were engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry; and considerably more than onefourth (279 per cent) were engaged in manufacturing and mechanical industlies Thus, over threefilths of all gainful workers were occupied in these two general divisions of occupations The remaining twofilths of the workers were distributed among the other seven large classes of occupations, no class furnishing employment to as many as 10 per cent of all gainful workers For the males, as for both sexes combined, agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry gave employment to the largest proportion of the gainful workers, 361 per cent, and manufacturing and mechanical industries ranked second, with 294 per cent -largely to tlw fact that in Porto Rilo 4,1 per cont uf the males were under 15 years c,f ago, ns agrdnst on1v -315 per cent in the United States But in the mai~ population 10 years of age and over the proportion of gainful workers was larger in Porto Rico than in the United States The proportion of gainful workers both in the total female population and in the female popuJatiou 10 years of age and over was smaller in Porto Rico in 1910 than in the United States The fact that in J910 in Porto Rico 419 per cent, while in the United States only 327 per cent of the females were under 15 years of age accounts partially for the lower proportion of gainful workers in the female population of Porto Rico In Porto Rico from 1899 to 1910 there was an increase in the proportion of gainful workers, both in the total population and in the population 10 years of age and over There was a slight increase in the proportion of all males, but a slight decrease in the proportion of the males 10 years of age and over gainfully occupied The proportion of all females and of the females 10 years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations was larger in 1910 than in 1899 -Domestic and personal service was the principal field of employment for female workers in 1910, 313 per cent of them being engaged in this branch of occupations, as compared with 224 per cent in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and 225 per cent in manufacturing and mechanical industries -Because of the changes made in the classifimttion of occupations at the Thirteenth Census, it is impossible to classify the occupations for preceding censuses according to the scheme followed at the Thirteenth Census It is possible, however, to classify the Thir-teenth Census occupations according to the scheme followed at preceding censuses In the following table, for purposes of comparison, the Thirteenth Census occupations are armnged according to the five general divisions of occupations followed at preceding censuses: -P,!r cent Per cPnt I !

discussed in a previous section (p 27) The decrease in the proportion of females engaged in domestic and l)ersonal service is accounted for in part by a decrease in the number of female \"laborers (not specified)\" from l:l3,975 in 1900 to 19,99S in 1910,1 and in part by the great increase in the proportion engaged in agricultural pursuits and in trade and transportation The great increase in the proportion engaged in agricultural pursuits and in trade and transportation also accounts mainly for the decrease in the proportion engaged in manufacturing and mechanical pursuits -Divisions and statesThe distribution of persons engaged in gainful occupations in 1910, according to general divisions of occupations, is shown for each geographic division and for each state in Table 10 -(p 44) The proportion in each general division of occupations in 1910 is shown graphically for each state in the diagram on page 43 This table shows that, while in the United States as a whole practically onethird of the gainful work-ers in 1910 were engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, this proportion varied from onetenth in the New England and Middle Atlantia divisions to over sixtenths in the East South Central and West South Central divisions Only in six statesPennsylvania, Weat Virginia, Montana, Wyoming, Arizona, and Nevadadid the extraction of minerals furnish employment for a3 many as onetenth of the gainful workers in 1910 Manufacturing and mechanical industries gave employment to almost onehalf of the gainful workers in New England, to over twofifths of those in the :Middle Atlantic divi?sion, but to only about oneeighth of those in the East South Central and We:,t South Central divisions The proportion of the gainful ,vorkers engaged in transportation varied from 4 per cent in the East South Central to 103 l)er cent in the Mountain allll Pacific divisions, while the proportion engaged in trade varied from 53 per cent in the East South Central to 126 per cent in the Pacific division, and was much higher in the geographic divisions of the North and in the Pacific division than in the geographic divisions of the South and in the Mountain division The proportion engaged in professional service aried from 2,6 per cent in the East South Central to 6 per cent in the Pacific division, and was consi<lerahly lower in each of the agricultural divisions of the South than in the other geographic divisions The proportion engaged in domestic and personal service Yaried from 81 per cent in the 1i~est South Central to 118 per cent in the Middle Atlantic division; and the proportion engaged in clericill occu-pations varied from 17 per cent in the East South Central to 71 per cent in the :Middle Atlantic division -In the New England division almost onehalf (491 per cent) of the gainful workers in 1910 were engaged in manufacturing and mechanical industries; and in each state of this division except Vermont, a larger proportion of the gainful workers were engaged in tbis than in any other branch of occupations Wmle only 104 per cent of the gainfully occupied persons in New England were engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, the proportion was 269 per cent -in Maine, 191 per cent in New Hampshire, and 344 per cent in Vermont In the Middle Atlantic division 406 per cent of the gainful workers in 1910 were engaged inmanufacturing and mechanical industries, and in the state of New Jersey the proportion in this class of occupations was 458 per cent Trade gave employment to 12 per cent of the gainful workers, domestic and personal service to -118 per cent, and agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry to 10 per cent In Pennsylvania, 105 per cent of the gainful workers were engaged in the extraction of minerals In the East North Central division the most important class of occupations in 1910 was manufacturing and mechanical industries, which gave employment to almost onethird (332 per cent) of the gainful workers Next in importance was agriculture, forestry, and animalhusbandry1 in which over onefourth -(256 per cent) of the gainful workers were employed In the West North Central division nver twofilths (412 per cent) of the gainful workers of the division were engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, the proportion ranging from 344 per cent in 11innesotato 602 percent in North Dakota While 20 per cent of the workers in this division were engaged in manufacturing and mechanical industries, the proportion varied in the states from 98 per cent in North Dakota to 236 per cent in Missouri More than onehalf (514 per cent) of the gainful workers in the South Atlantic division in 1910 were engaged in agricuJture1 forestry, and animal husbandry In Delaware and in Maryland manufacturing and mechanical industries! and in the District of Columbia domestic and personal service, gave employment to the largest proportion of the gainful workers; but in each of the remaining states agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry was far the most important class of occupations In West Virginia the proportion of the workers engaged in the extraction of minerals (144 per cent) was larger than in any of the other states except Arizona and Nevada; and, because of the location of the numerous Federal bureaus in the District of Columbia, the proportion of the gainful workers engaged in clerical occupations there (153 per cent) was much larger than in any state -In the East South Central division 632 per cent, and in the West South Central division 601 per cent of the -gainfully occupied persons in 1910 were engaged in agriculture, forestry1 and animal husbandry; and in each of the states in these two geographic divisions over onehalf of the gainful workers were engaged in this branch of occupations, the proportion rising to -704 per cent in Arkansas and to 772 per cent in Mississippi Only oneeighth of the gainful workers in these two divisions were occupied in manufacturing and mechanical industries in 1910 In the Mountain division almost onethird (324 per cent) of the persons engaged in gainful occupations in 1910 were employed in agriculture, forestry, and animal hm3bandry; but in the states the proportion ranged from less than onefifth (195 per cent) in Nevacla to over onehalf (551 per cent) in New Mexico While the proportion of the workers engaged in the extraction of minerals in 1910 was largest in the Mountain division, less than onetenth (94 per cent) of the workers of this divfaion were engaged in this branch of occupations Bowever, the proportion was 177 per cent in Arizona and 219 per cent in Nevada -In the Pacific division in 1910, 272 per cent of the gainful workers were engaged in manufacturing and mechanical industries, and 226 per cent in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, thus showing that practically onehalf of the gainful workers were in these two general divisions of occupations Trade gave employment to 126 per cent of the gainful workers, domestic and personal service to 113 per cent, and transportation to 103 per cent -The males engaged in gainful occupations in 1910 are distributed by general divisions of occupations for each geographic division and for each state, in Table 11 (p 46) -Since, in the United States in 1910, males constituted 857 per cent of the persons engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, 999 per cent of the persons engaged in the extraction of minerals, 829 per cent of the persons engaged in manufacturing and mechanical industries, 96 per cent of  the persons engaged in transportation, 87,1 per cent of the persons engaged in trade, and 97 per cent of the persons engaged in public service, the proportion of the male gainful workers engaged in each of these six general divisions of occupations conforms very closely to that for bi:>th sexes, discussed in the preceding paragraphs Practically the only difference is that a somewhat larg~r proportion of the males than of both sexes was engaged in each of these six general divisions of occupations This close similarity between all gainful workers and the male gainful workers in the proportion engaged in each of these six general divisions of occupations holds not only for the entire United States but for each geographic clivision and for each state The

serYice, as contrasted with a proportion of 44 per cent for all gainful workers Likewise, in each geographic division and in each state, a smaller proportion of the male workers than of all workers wns engaged in professional service While 99 per cent of all gainful workers in 1910 were engaged in domestic and personal service, only 41 per cent of the male gainful workers were so occupied In each geographic division, also, and in each state, a smaller per cent of the male workers than of all gainful workers were engaged in domestic and personal service In 19101 -38 per cent of all gainfully occupied males were engaged in clerical occupations, the proportion ranging from 17 per cent in the East South Central to?62 per centin the MiddleAtlanticdivision, andfrom 1 percent in Mississippi to 15 per cent in the District of Columbia The large proportion in the District of Columbia is accounted for by the location there of the de~artments of the Federal Government The females engaged_ in gainful occupations in 1910 are distributed by general divisions of occupations, for each geographic division and for each state, in Table 12 (p 48) -224 per cent of the gainfully occupied females were ehgaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, the proportion varying from 14 por cent in New England to 594 per cent in the East South Central division The very high proportion in the agricultural divisions of the South is accounted for by the large proportion of negroes in the female population Manufacturing and mechanical industries gave employment to 225 per cent of the gainfully occupied females, but this proportion varied from 55 per cent in the West South Central and G8 per cent in the E:Ist South Central divisions to 453 per cent in New England The proportion engi!ged in transportation vm穒ed from :fivetenths of 1 per cent in the South AtJantic and East South Centrr:1 divisions to 25 per cent in the Pacific division; and the proportion engaged in trade varied from 2 per cent in the East South Central to 99 per cent in the Pacific division The Mountain division had the highest proportion engaged in public service, seventenths of 1 per cent The proportion engaged in professional service ranged from 41 per cent in the East South Central to 173 per cent in the West North Oentr:11 division Domestic and personal service furnished employment to a larg~ proportion of the gainfully occupied females in 1910 than did any other general division of occupations, 313 per cent The proportion was lowest in the East South Central division, 253 per cent, and highest in the Mountain division, 395 per cent Clerical occupations were followed by 73 per cent?of the female gainful workers in 1010, the proportion varying from 18 per cent in the East Souili Central to 134 per cent in the Pacific division In New England over 7 out of 10 of the gainfully occupied females in 1910 were engaged in two larg\" liranches of occupations manufacturing and mochan贩 -ic:11 industries, which gave employment to 453 per cent, and domes_tic and personal service, which gave employment to 27!J per cent In the !fiddle Atlantic states 359 per cent of the gainfully occupied females in HJIO were engaged in manufacturing and mechanical industries and 334 per cent were engaged in domestic and personal service, these two branches of occupations together giving employment to almost seventenths (693 per cent) of the female 穡orkers in these states -In the East North Central division in 1910 over onefourth (266 per cont) of the gainfully occupied females were engaged in manufacturing and mechanical industries and over onethird (338 per cent) were engaged in domestic and personal service, more than threefilths (604 per cent) thus being engaged in these two divisions of occupations -In the West North Central division only 88 per cent of the gainfully occupied females in 1010 were engaged in agi:iculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, but the proportion rose to 167 per cent in North Dakota and to 183 per cent in South Dnkota The proportion en~ gaged in manufacturing and mechanical industries was 18 per cent for the division, hut varied in the states from 81 per cent in North Dakota to 22 per cent in :Missouri The proportion engaged in professional service was higher than in any other geographic division, 173 per cent, as compared with 91 percent in the entire United States Likewise, in each state in this division the proportion engaged in professional service was far higher than in the United States; and in Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas over onefilth of the gainfulfemales in 1910were engaged in professional service The proportion engaged in domestic and personal service varied from 32f) por cent in Kansas to 45 per cent in North Dakob -In the South Atlantic division 462 per cent of the gainfully occupied females in 1910 were engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry Exclucling tho District of Columbia, this proportion was -42 per cent in Maryland, 62 per cent in Delaware, and in the other states of the division varied from 168 per cent in West Virginia to 714 per cent in South Carolina These great variations were due mainly to differences in the proportion of negroes in the female population After agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, domestic and personal service was the most important branch of occupations for the gainfully occupied females of the South Atlantic division, giving employment to 308 per cent of them Manufacturing and mechanical industries gave employment to 12 5 per cent, the proportion varying in the states (exclucling the District of Columbia) from 7 per cent in Georgia al1d 7 8 per cent in South Carolina to 25 1Jer cent in Delaware and to 30 per cent in Mary-land The high proportion of females engaged in professional service in West Virginia, 12 per cent, as contrasted with 48 per cent for the entire geographic division, is accounted for mainly by the krw proportion of negroes in the female population of West Virginia, -48 per cent, as contrasted with 344 per cent in the entire geographic division And the high proportion of the gainfully occupied females engaged ill clerical occupations ill the District of Columbia, 16 per cent, as contrasted 穡ith 26 per cent for the entire geographic division, and with 7:3 per cent for the entire United States, i; accounted for by the large number of female clerks in the :Federal departments In the East South Central division in 1910 almost threefilths (594 per cent) of the gainfully occupied females were engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, the proportion varying from a little more than onefilth (208 per cent) in Kentucky to nMrly fourfifths (791 per cent) in Mississippi The greater relative importance of agriculture arid the larger proportion of negroes in the female population explain the high proportion in Alabama (709 per cent) and :Mississippi (791 per cent), as compared with the proportion ill Kentucky (208 per cent) and Tennessee (369 per cent) Domestic and personal service gave employment to 253 per cent of the gaillfully occupied females of this division in 1910, the proportion varyu1g from 147 per cent in 1fi:;sissippi to 416 per cent in Kentucky -In the West South Central division more than eighttenths (822 per cerit) of the gainfully occupied females in 1910 were engaged in two general divisions of occupationsagriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry which gave employment to 558 per cent, and domestic and personal service which gave employment to 264 per cent In Oklahoma the low proportion of negroes in the female populntiou, 85 per cent, as contrasted with 234 per cent for the entire geographic division, accounts mainly for the low proportion of females engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry-398 per cent, as compared 穡ith 558 per cent for the entire geographic divisionand also for the high proportion engaged in professional service124 per cent, as contrasted with 61 per cent for the division In the Mountain division in 1910 agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry was an important field of occupations for females in but two states, Idaho and New Mexico In Idaho 126 per cent, and in New Mexico 227 per cent of the gainfully occupied females were engaged in this branch of occupations :Manufacturing and mechanical industries gave employment to 153 per cent of the gainfully occupied females in the division, the proportion varying from 88 per cent in Nevada to 306 per cent in Arizona, where the large number of Indian female weavers mainly accounts for the large proportion The proportion of the gainfully occupied females engaged in professional service in this division, and in each of the states which comprise -it, wus considerably larger than the proportion for the entire United States; and the proportion engaged in domestic and personal service, 395 per cent, was higher than in any other geographic dhision -Of the gainfully occupied fmnales in the Pacific divi:,ion in 1910, 36 per cent were engaged in domestic anrl personal service, 166 per cent in pro:fossional service, 161 per cent in manufacturing i:md mechanical industries, and l~L4 per cent in clerical occupations TI10 proportion engaged in clerical occupations was larger than in any other geographic divi\";ion, and the proportion engaged in professional service was larger than in any other geographic division except the We,st North Central -Outlying territoriesThe following table shows, for Alaska, Hawaii, and Porto Hico1 tl1e gainful workers of each sex in 1910 dh,tributed hj,?general <livisions of occupations -In Alaska, as shown by Table 13, 284 per cent of the gainful workers in 1910 were engaged in the extraction of minerals and 229 per cent in manufacturing and JJ1echanical industries These two general divisions of occupations together thus gave employment to more than onehalf (513 per cent} of the -gainful workers Agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry gave employment to 114 per cent of the gainful workers, and domestic and personal service to Hi8 per cent As compared with the United States/ a far larger proportion of: the workers in Alaska vrnre engaged in the extraction of minerals and in domestic and personal service, and a somewhat larger proportion in transportation and in public service, but the proportion engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry was much smaller The proportions for the males differed little from the proportions for both sexes Of the gainfully occupied females, 362 per cent were engaged in manufacturing and mechanical industries, 135 per cent in professional service, and 385 per cent in domestic and personal service These three genei;al divisions of occupations gave employment to 882 per cent of all gainfully occupied females The principal manufacturing occupations followed by the females of Alaska were :fish curing and packing) basket making, dressmaking, and sewing As compared with the United States,1 a much smaller proportion of the females in Alaska were engaged in agriculture,forestry, andanimalhusban<lry, and a much larger proportion were engaged in professional service -In Hawaii considerably more than onehalf (557 per cent) of the gainful workers in 1910 were engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry :Manufacturing and mechanical industries gave employment to 152 per cent of the gainful workers, transportation to 66 per cent, trade to 58 per cent, and domestic and personal service to 93 per cent The proportion engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal lrnsban<lry was much larger, and the proportion engaged in manufacturing and mechanical industries was much smaller than was the case in the United States1 The proportions for the males did not Vary materially from the proportions for both sexes Of the gainfully occupied females, 428 per cent were engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and 335 per cent in domestic and personal service These two general divisions of occupations together gave employment to over threefourths (763 per cent) of the -gainfully occupied females The proportion engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry was much larger, and the proportion engaged in manufacturing and mechanical i:ridustries and in clerical occupations was much smaller than was the case in the United States1 -In Porto Rico agliculture, forestry, and animal husbamhy was by far the most important branch of occupations, giving employment to more than threefilths (611 per cent) of the gainful workers i:r1 1910 :Manufacturing and mechanical industries gave employment to 135 per cent of the gainful workers and domestic and personal service to 139 per cent As compared with the United States,1 a much larger proportion of the gai:r1ful workers ip Porto Rico was engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, a somewhat larger proportion in domestic and personal service, but a smaller proportion in each of the other general divisions of occupations Of the gainfully occupied males of Porto Rico in 1910, 725 per cent were engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, 11 per cent in manufacturing and mechanical industries, and 78 per centin trade rhese three general divisions of occupations combined thus gave employment to more than ninetenths (913 pel cent) ofthegainfullyoccupiedmalesofPortoRico The proportion engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry was a little more than double the proportion in the United States;1 hut the proportion in each of the other general divisions of occupations was higher in t礶 United States than in Porto Rico Of the gainfully occupied females of Porto Rico in 1910, 14 per cent were engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, 237 per cent in manufacturing and meclumical industries, and 587 per cent in domestic and personal service The proportion engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry was much smaller than in the United States 1 or in Hawaii; the proportion engaged in manufacturing and mechanical industries was slightly higher than in the United States and much higher than in Hawaii; and the proportion engaged in domestic and personal service was much higher than in the United States or in Hawaii -Principal occupations in 1910Table I (p 91) shows, for the United States, the number and sex of the persons 10 years of age and over engaged in 1910 in each of 428 specified occupations and occupation groups Table 14 shows the number of males and of female:,1 engaged in each of 116 principal occupations pursued in the United Stittcs in 1910 In only 17 of these occupations did the number of females exceed the number of males -Comparison with previous censuses,The new classification of occupations followed at the Thirteenth Census shows occupations in so much greater cletnil than they were shown at preceding censuses that it was im-possible to rearrange the occupations of preceding censuses according to the Thirteenth Census classification But comparison with preceding censuses is of such great importance that the Thirteenth Census occupations have been rearranged according to the occupation classification of the Twelfth Census, notwithstanding the fact that this classification was in many respects unsatisfactory The results of this reclassification are given in Table 15 (p 54), which shows,for both sexes ancl for each sex separately, the number of persons engaged in the different occupation groups of the 1900 classification at each of the censuses 1880, 1890, 1900, and 1910 -\\x0cOCCUPATION STATISTICS In order

and in each case the higher proportion in the New England and 1iiddle Atlantic divisions was due mainly to the same causesa larger proportion of foreign born in the female population, a larger proportion of urban population, and the existence of more industries which furnished suitable employment to females Likewise, the high proportion which females constituted of all gainful workers in the South Atlantic, East South Central, and West South Central divisions1 as compared with tho Mountain and Pacific divisions, is accounted for mainly by the large negro female population in the South, together with the fact that a much larger proportion of thenegro than of the white females were gafofullyoccupied in 1910 Also, in the different states the variations in the proportion which females constituted of a11 gainful workers in 1910 corresponded in general with -the variations in the proportion of the female population 10 years of age and over gainfully occupied in 1910 (see Table 1), and, usually, the causes of the -to each 100 females Thus, the fact that in the Mountain division there were 1279 males and in the Pacific division 1295 males to each 100 females, accounts in part for the comparatively low proportion which females constituted of all gainful workers in each of these divisions In Nevada in 1910 the proport,ion of the females 10 years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations was larger than in any other state in the Mountain division (see Table 1, p 26), but the proportion which the females constituted of all gainful workers was smaller in Nevada than in any other state in the division except Wyoming This unusual condition probably was due to the fact that in Nevada the number of males to each 100 females, 1792, was larger than in any other state in the United StatesJ while the proportion of the males 10 years of age and over engaged in gainful occupations, 873 per cent, was also very large -The proportion of each sex in all gainful occupations in 1910, as cornpare1l with HJ00, is shown graphically for each state in the diagram on page GO, while the proportion of males and females in each principal occupation in which the workers of oach sex constituted 1 per cent or more of the total workers in the United States in 1910 is sho,vn graphically in the diagram on page 61 -In the United States as a whole in 1910 females constituted 143 per cent of all persons engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, but this proportion varied from 31 per cent in the Pacific to 246 per cent in the East South Central division, and exceeded 4 per cent only in the South AtlHntic, the East South Central, and the West South Central divisions, where the high proportions are explained by the large nu:rnbers of negro female agricultural laborers The great variation in the proportions between the different states of these three geographic divisions are due mainly to differences in the proportion of negroes in the population The large negro population and the great importance of cotton mising together account for the exceptic,nally large proportion which females constituted of all persons engaged in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkrmsus, and Louisiana in 1910 -In the United States, in each of the geographic divisions, and in each of the state;;

per cent in Wisconsin The great variation between 1v1ichigan and Indiana in the proportion of the males 10 to 15 years of age engaged in gainful occupations in 1910 resulted in part from the proportion of the males 10 to 13 years of age engaged in gainful occupations (Table 30) being much smaller ir1 Michigan (31 per cent) than in Indiana (7 9 per cent) In each state of the East North Central division except Indiana, there was a decrease from 1900 to !910 in the proportion both of the mules and of the females 10 to 15 years of age engaged in gainful occupations, the decrease being

the proportion was lowest in Kansas (17 per cent) and highest in Missouri (43 per cent) The high proportion in_ Missouri, as contrasted with that in the other states of this division, is accounted for in part, probably, by the larger proportion of negroes in the population of 1fissouri The proportion of the males 10 to 15 years of age engaged in gainful occupations was smaller in 1910 than in 1900 in each state of the West North Central division except North Dakota, where the proportion increased from 146 per cent in 1900 to 165 per cent in 1910 In each state the proportion of the fomales 10 to

in South Carolina, an<l for the females from 43 per cent in West Virginia to 454 per cent in South Carolina These great variations doubtless are accounted for mainly by differences in the proportion of negroes in this age period, together with the fact that usually a far larger proportion of the negro than of the v,hite children are gainfully occupied For the tables of this report a separate tabulation by color or race has not yet been mado of the Thirteenth Census returns of children engaged in gainful occupations, but the Twelfth Census figures show that in the SouthAtlantic division,

from 1900 to 1910 in the proportion of the males in this age period gainfully occupied In each state of the South Atlantic division except Delaware and :Maryland, the proportion of the females 10 to 15 years of age engaged in gainful occupations was larger in 1910 than in 1900, the increase being especially marked in North Carolina and Georgia In each of these two states the proportion of the females 10 to 15 years of age engaged in gainful occupations was over 10 per cent higherin 1910 than in 1900 -In the East South Central dinsion 506 per cent of the males and 26 per cent of the females

from 73 per cent in Kentucky to 433 per cent in )Iississippi These variations correspond rather closely to the variations in the proportion of negrocs in the population, and doubtless the proportion of the children gainfully occupied was determined in part by the proportion which negro children constituted of the total In each stato of the East South C\\\\穘tral division except Kentucky, the

Oklahoma to 305 per cent in Arkansas lhe low proportion of the children of Oklahoma engaged in gainful occupations, as contrasted with the proportion for each of the other states of this geographic dirision, probably is accounted for largely by the smaller proportion of negroes in the population of Oklahoma in 19108a per cent, as contrasted with -226 per cent for the entire division However, in 1910, the prop<frtion of the children of each sex 10 to 15 years of age engaged in gainful occupations was far higher ju Arkamms than in Louisiana, nofr withstanding the fact that the proportion of negroes in the population was 28l p(ll cent in Arkansas and 431 per cent in Louisiana In part this resulted from, though it is not accounted for, by the proportion of the children 10 to 13 years of age engaged in gainful occupations being practically twice as large in Arkansas as in Louisiana While in 1910 the proportion gainfully occupied was larger for the males in each age period and for the females in each of the first three age periods in Arkansas than it was in Louisiana (Tables 30 ancl 31), the difference was far greater in the age period 10 to 13 than in either of the higher age periods :From 1900 to 1910 the proportion of the males 10 to 15 years of age engaged in gainful occupations increased in Arkansas and Texas and decreased in Louisiana and Oklahoma, and the proportion

periods was very low The proportions for the males did not vary much from the proportions for both sexes Of the female workers almost threefourths (74 percent) were in the age period 21 to 44 years The proportion in this age period was considerably larger and the proportion in each of the other age periods considerably smaller than in the United States -In Porto Rico practically threefourths (747 per cent) of the gainful workers in Hll0 wero 21 years of age and over Children 10 to 13 years of age constituted 42 per cent, children 14 to 15 years of age constituted 54 per cent, and young persons 16 to 20 years of age constituted 157 per cent of the gainful workers As compared 穡ith the United States/ the proportion of the workers in each of the first three age periods was high in Porto Rico, and the proportion in each of the lust two age periocis was low The proportions for the males differed little from the proportions for both sexes A smaller proportion of the female than of the male workers was in the age period 21 to 44, but each of the other age periods contained a larger proportion of the females than of the males -The industrial prominence of New Jersey is due largely to its exceptionally favorable geogrnphic position and to its splendid transportation facilities, since a large part of the materials used in the manufacturing industries of tho state are produced beyond its borders and most of the manufactured products are shipped to outside markets The proximity of the state to the anthracite coal :fields of Pennsylvania, which supply a large portion of the fuel used in its manufacturing industries, and to the markets of New York City and Philadelphia, have been powerful fac~ors in its industrial development The manufacturmg centers of the state are either located on New York Harbor or connected therewith by water or by rail A total trackage of 2,256 miles 1 of steam railroads was operated within the state in 1909 -The table on the following page gives the most important figures relative to all classes of manufactures combined for 1909, 1904, and 1899, together with the percentages of increase from census to census -In general, this table brings out the fact that the manufacturing industries of New Jersey had a greater development during the more recent fiveyear period, 19041909, than during the preceding :fiveyear period, 18991904 During the more recent period the number of establishments increased 258 per cent and the average number of wage earners 225 per cent, -The relative importance and growth of the leading manufacturing industries of the state are shown in the tt1ble on page 741 -It should be borne in mind, in considering this table, that the value of products in some of the industries involves a certain amount of duplication due to the use of the product of one establishment in the industry as material for another establishment -tistics can not be presented for 1904 and 1899 on account of changes in classi:fication1 Of the industries which are not presented separately, those which are of special importance are petroleum refining and the refining of cane sugar The statistics for 1909, however, for 6 of these industries, namely, the manufacture of automobiles, including bodies and parts; blacking and cleansing and polishing preparations; chocolate and cocoa products; mens furnishing goods; signs and advertising novelties; and sulphuric, nitric, and mixed acids are presented separately in Table II, page 774, -There are, as already noted, a very large number of industries which are of considerable importance Furtherm9re1 it will be seen from Table II that there is a wide diversity in the manufacturing activities of the state The leading products of the state are refined copper, silk goods, woolen goods, and foundry and :machineshop products If the several textile industries are combined and considered as a unit they constitute the leading industry of the state The principal details

manufacture of silk and silk goods, including the operations of throwsters; woolen, worsted, and felt goods, and wool hats; cotton goods, including cotton small wares; furfelt hats; cordage and twine and jute and linen goods; hosiery and knit goods; carpets and rugs, other than rag; and shoddy The statistics for the manufacture of shoddy can not be shown without disclosing the operations of individual establishments Combined, the other seven industries gave employment in 1909 to an average of 60,647 wage earners and the value of their products amounted to $133,205,000 These figures represent an increase over 1904 of 9,670, or 19 per cent, in the average number of wage earners and $48,160,000, or 566 per cent, in value of products From 1899 to 1904 the gain in number of wage earners was 4,177, or 89 per cent, and that in value of products $12,405,000, or 171 per cent In 1909, 186 per cent of the total number of wage earners employed in the manufacturing industries of the state and 116 per cent of the total value of manufactured products were reported for these industries The corresponding figures for 19O4were 191 percentand llpercent, respectively Dyeing and finishing textilesClosely allied to the textile industry is the dyeing and :finishing of textiles The classification covers the independent establishments bleaching, dyeing, and mercerizing raw :fibers, yarns, and woven cloth, as well as the printing of cotton piece goods A considerable number of the cotton, silk, and woolen mills carry on one or more of these subordinate processes with the primary manufacturing in the same establishment, therefore the statistics for the independent establishments engaged in dyeing and :finishing do not represent the full extent of the industry In 1909 reports for some of the dyeing and :finishing establishments in the state included the cost of the materials upon which the work was performed and its value as :finished In such cases the cost and value of these goods were deducted, in order to place all of the reports on a uniform basis and to make the statistics comparable with those for prior censuses, when the value of products represented only the value added to the materials by the processes From 1904 to 1909 the average number of wage earners in the industry increased 2,532, or 333 per cent, and the value of products $3,816, 000, or 319 per cent In 1904 New Jersey was the first state in the Union in this industry, with products valued at $11,980,000, but -Smelting anil refining, copperThis industry is confined chiefly in New Jersey to the refining of crude copper The value of all ore smelted and crude copper refined is included in the cost of materials, and the total value of all products is reported, regardless of whether the

and all allied industries except those which manufacture adistinctive product which is covered by some other classification, such as cash registers and calculating machines sewing machines, and electrical machinery Theestab~ lishments engaged in the manufacture of gas meters hardware, plumbers supplies, steam fittings, structurJ ironwork, and castiron pipe, nearly all of which were reported under separate classifications at previous censuses, are all included under this general heading The industry showed a relatively greater increase in value of products from 1899 to 1904 than from 1904 to 1909 the percentages being 365 and 294, respectively 1 -1439 per cent, and the value of products $19,829,000, or 111 7 percent The industry is confined largely to the northern part of the state, 594 per cent of the total value of products being reported from Jersey City alone WireThis classification includes estal,ilishments primarily engaged in drawing wire from purchased wire rods It does not include the wire product of the wire departments of steel works and rolling mills The industry shows a remarkable growth for each of the :fiveyear periods  -Leather, tanned, curried, andfinishedThls industry includes not only establishments whlch are engaged primarily in the manufacture of leather, but also those which treat hides or skins for others The cost of materials and the value of products, however, do not include the value of the hides or skins treated under contract In 1849 New Jersey was the seventh state of the Union with respect to value of products, reporting 143 establishments, which employed an average of 618 wage earners and turned out products v~~ed at $1,389,582 In 1909 the state held fourth position, in which year, although only 86 establishments were engaged in the industry, the number of wage earners was nearly nine times as great and the v!!lue of products more than twenty times as great as in 1~49 -rapid extension of the uses of electricity in science and industry has created an increasing demand for -ranees with which to utilize such energy There?p ~twas to be expected that the industry would show orearkable development during the decade

production of silverware and plated ware and the reducing and refining of gold and silver from clippings, sweepings, and scrap In 1909 these tbJ∑ee industries combined employed an average of 5,416 wage earners, and turned out products valued at $20,743,000 The most important branch of the industry is the manufacture of jewelry, which gave employment to an average of 4,008 wage earners in 1909 and reported products to the value of $13,272,000 Measured by value of products, New Jersey ranked fourth among the states in the jewelry industry in 1909 -1583 per cent and 2403 per cent, respectively Pottery, terra~cotta, andjireclay productsThe name of New Jersey is intimately associated with this indus~ry, and the state held second rank among the states In the industry at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and - value added by manufacture, and first in number of wage earners; the woolengoods industry ranks fifth in value of products, sixth in value added by manu-It should be borne in mind, in considering this table, that the value of products in some of the industries involves a certain amount of duplication due to the use of the product of one establishment in the industry as material for another establishment -The important industries listed in this table, in which they are arranged in the order of the value of products, call for brief consideration -Oars and general shop construction and repairs by steamrailroad companiesThis industry represents the work done in the car shops operated by steamrailroad companies and is exclusive of minor repairs in roundhouses Although there may be a limited amount of new construction, the operations consist almost exclusively of repairs to the rolling stock and equipment of the companies reporting∑ Although there was a slight decrease shown in the total value of products from 1904 to 1909, in the latter year these shops gave employment to an average of 1,489 wage earners and reported products to the value of $2,251,000, a greater number of wage earners and a greater value of products than reported for any other manufacturing industry in the territory -Printing a,nd publishingThe majority of the establishments in this industry are small newspaper and job printing offices, and although the number of establishments is in excess of that reported for any other industry, the number of wage earners and value of products 11re not correspondingly large Employment was given to an 11verage of but 283 wage earners, and the total value of products was $589,000 -mills reported for this industry, and as a rule were small and located in the rural districts They gave employment to an average of 28 wage earners and -Measured by value added by manufacture these industries held a somewhat different rank tha~ when measu:ed by val?e of pro~ucts, the lumber industry becommg first∑ m order mstead of steamrailroad repair shops, which, in turn, becomes second, while bakery products becomes fourth in order instead of flourmill and gristmill manufactures, which, in turn, becomes fifth Owing to the comparatively simple processes involved in the latter industry, and the extent to which these processes are carried on by machinery, the value added by manufacture is not commensurate with the gross value of products or the number of the establishments -This table shows also the percentages of increase for the leading industries in respect to value of products and value added by manufacture Of the specified industries, printing and publishing shows the greatest percentage of increase from 1904 to 1909 both in value of products and in value added by manufacture -The following table shows, for 1909, in percentages, for all industries combined, the distribution of the average number of wage earners by age periods, and for those ï16 years of age and over by sex, calculated in the manner described in the Introduction It also shows, for some of the important industries separately, a similar distribution of wage earners as report,ed for December 15, or the nearest representative day AB a means of judging the impo_rtance of the several industries the average number employed for the year is also given in each case -In all industries combined, 725 per cent of the average number of wage earners were males 16 years of age and over; 252 per cent, females 16 :years of age and over; and 23 per cent, children under the age of 16 Of the total number of women employed as wage earners, 316 per cent were in the cottongoods, silkgoods, and woolen and worsted goods industries, over onehalf of the employees in each of these industries being women 16 years of age and over The manufacture of boots and shoes, mens clothing, electrical machinery, and tobacco products each shows a large proportion of female wage earners, 363 per cent, 663 per cent, 393 per cent, and 702 per cent, respectively -The three textile industries above mentioned together employed 30 per cent of the total number of w11ge earners under 16 years of 11ge The proportions of such wage earners engaged in each industry were as follows: Cotton goods, 89 per cent; silk goods, 36 per cent; and woolen and worsted goods, 45 per cent -In order to compare the distribution of persons engaged in manufactures in 1909 with that shown at the census of 1904, it is necessary to use the classi£cation employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) The following table makes this comparison according to occupational status: -1904 Comparable :figures are not obtainable for 1899 The table shows that the greatest percentage of increase was in the salaried employees -The following table shows the average number of wage eamers, distributed according to age periods, and in the case of those 16 years of age and over according to sex, for 19091 1904, and 1899 The averages for 1909 are estimated on the basis of the actual number of wage earners reported for a single representative day (See Introduction) -This table indicates that for all industries combined the proportion of children under 16 years of age was s~aller in 1909 than in 1899 Although there was not -much change in the proportions of male and female wage earners 16 years of age and over, the proportion of females was greater in 1909 than in 1899, while on the other hand, that of males was smaller in 1909 -Wage earners employed, by monthsThe following table gives the number of wage earners employed on the 15th of each month during the year 1909 for all industries combined, for the canning and preserving industry, and for all other industries combined; it gives also the percentage which the number reported for each month is of the greatest number reported for any month In lable II, page 774, are shown, for a majority of the important industries in the state, the largest number and the smallest number of wage earners reported for any month The figures are for the 15th day, or the nearest representative day, of the month -Canning and preserving, which is a seasonal industry, gave employment to a large number of persons in the months of August, September, and October, and to a relatively small number through the winter and spring months From 273 wage earners in January, the number employed increased to 6,021 in September The -t t 1 4 unum ac 1YJ y, was on y 5 per cent of the number reported for September, the month of maximum activity In the glass industry the greatest number of wage ea;n 7,286, was reported for the month of April, and thel::t number, 1,151, for the month of August This var∑ _ tion is a?counte~ for by the fact that the manufact~:e of glass 1s practically suspended during the months of July and August So few wage earners are employed in these two industries, however, as compared with the total number employed in all industries that they have only a slight effect on the fluctuatio~ of employment from month to month in all industries combined, -Prevailing hours of laborIn the next table wage earners have been classified according to the prevailing hours of labor in the establishment in which they are employed In malting this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year is used, and the number employed in each establishment is classified as a total according to the hours preï vailing in that establishment, even though a few employees work a greater or less number of hours -It is evident from this table that for the great majority of wage earners employed in the manufacturing industries of New Jersey the usual hours of labor range from 54 to 60 per week, 128 per cent of the \"total being employed in establishments where the prevailing hours are less than 54 a week and only -46 per cent in establishments where they are more than 60 a week In the maltliquor, marble and stone work, and printing and publishing industries 48 hours or less per week prevail for a majority of the wage earners In nearly all of the larger industries the prevailing hours are from 54 to 60 per week Practically all of the wage earners in the gas industry, however, are in plants where the hours of employment are 60 a week or more -AVERAGE NUMBER Oli WAGE EARNERS IN

value of products and average number of wage earners are shown separately for 1909, 1904, and 1899 -Newark, the largest and most important city in the state, shows an increase from 1904 to 1909 of $52,456,000 or 35 per cent, in value of products and 9,258, or 183 per cent, in the average number of wage earners In value of manufactured products, it stood eleventh :among the cities of the United States in 1909 and tenth in 1904 and 1899 Eighteen and fourtenths per cent of the wage earners employed in manufactures in the :state in 1909 and 17 7 per cent of the value of the manufactured products were reported from Newark The leading industry of the city in 1909 was the smelting and refining of copper, but statistics for this industry ,can not be shown separately without disclosing the operations of individual establishments Next in or<ler of importance as measured by value of products were leather ( tanned, curried, and∑ finished), foundry -ïand machineshop products, jewelry, and malt liquors, the combined products of which represented 296 per ;ent of the total value of all products for the city 1n 1909 Other important industries were the manufacture of paint and varnish; electrical machinery and apparatus; chemicals; bread and other bakery products; printing and publishing; furfelt hats; slaughtering and meat packing; and copper, tin, and sheetiron products _Th? total value of products reported for Jersey City mcreased $53,034,000, or 70 per cent, from 1904 to 1909, and the average number of wage earners in-creased 5,101, or 251 per cent Among the leading industries, measured by value of products, was the slaughtering and meatpackmg industry, with products valued at $22,314,000, which represented 594 per cent of the total value of products for this industry in the state Other important inclustries were tobacco manufactures, foundries and machine shops, the manufacture of gas, and steamrailroad repair shops Three of the most importa,nt industries in the city in 1909 were the manufacture of soap, the refining of sugar, and the refining of petroleum, but their statistics can not be shown separately without disclosing the operations of individual establishments -tured products amounting to $13,007,000, or 215 per cent, from 1904 to 1909, and an increase in average number of wage earners of 462, or 65 per cent The leading industries were petroleum refining, smelting and refining from clippings, sweepings, and scrap, foundries and machine shops, and the manufacture of electrical machinery and apparatus The foundry and machineshop industry, however, is the only one of these for which statistics can be shown separately in Table I without disclosing the operations of individual establishments Twentyone industries were reported in 1909 which did not appear at the census of 1904, the ∑ most important of which were the manufacture of copper, tin, and ∑sheetiron products, cooperage and -Perth Amboy was the fourth city in the state in 1909 in value of manufactured products, having advanced from fifth position since 1904 and displaced Paterson , Since the city had less than 50,000 inhabitants in 1910, its statistics are presented by totals only in Table I From 1904 to 1909 the total value of products increased $38,292,000, or 110 per cent, and the l:lverage number of wage earners 1,916, or 485 per cent These large gains were due in a great measure to the appearance of several important industries in 1909 which were not reported at the census of 1904, such as the manufacture of ammunition, of paving materials, and of electrical machinery and apparatus, and to the increase in the value of products of the copper smelting and refining industry, which is by far the most important industry of the city -the total value of products for the city Other important industries were the dyeing and :finishing of textiles, foundries and machine shops, the making of mens clothing, and slaughtering and meat packing -The value of products for Elizabeth showed a slight decrease between 1904 and 1909, due principally to a falling off in foundry and machineshop products, and in oils, \"not elsewhere specified,\" and to the fact that a large establishment engaged in the refining of copper in 1904 was reported as idle in 1909 The most important industry in the city in 1909 was the manufacture of sewing machines The statistics for this industry can not be shown separately without disclosing the operations of individual establishments, but in 1909 the industry gave employment to more -to 855 wage earners and reported products to the value of $1_,808,000, f?n_ned the most important industry in the city Nextm importance were the bakeries and thee furniture factories The tanning and finishing ofleather shipbuilding, and the manufacture of moving pictur; apparatus and of lead pencils were other important industries, but their statistics can not be shown without disclosing the operation~ of individual establishments -The other incorporated places having over 10,000 population in the order of their importance as measï ured by value of products in 1909, and the principal industries of each, were as follows: Harrison, foundries and machine shops, steel works and rolling mills, and electrical machinery and apparatus; New Brunswick, surgical appliances and tobacco manufactures; West New York, lard refining, cottonseed oil and cake, and silk goods; Orange, phonographs and graphophones and furfelt hats; Phillipsburg, foundries and machine shops and silk goods; Garfield, worsted goods and paper and wood pulp; Kearny, siaughtering and meat packing and oilcloth and linoleum; Union, silk goods and malt liquors; Bloom:lield, electrical machinery and apparatus; West Hoboken, silk goods; Millville

bakeries; Hackensack, silk goods; Long Branch, mens clothing; Montclair, paper goods; West Orange, electrical machinery and appa∑ ratus; Morristown, bakeries; and Asbury Park, planing∑ mill products -Character of ownershipThe table on the opposite page has for its purpose the presentation of conditio~ in respect to the character of ownership, or legal orgamzation, of manufacturing enterprises For all ind?s∑∑ tries combined comparative figures are given covermg the censuses of 1909 and 1904 Comparative data for 1899 are not available Figures for 1909 only are presented for several important industries in~ividually In order to avoid disclosing the operations of individual concerns it is necessary to omit several important industries from this table and the one following -The most important distinction shown is that between corporate and all other forms of ownership For all industries combined, 29 per cent of the total number of establishments were under corporate ownership in 1909, as against 71 per∑cent under all other forms The corresponding :figures for 1904 were 262 per cent and 738 per cent, respectively Of the total value of prodl\"!cts in 1909, the establishments operated by corporations reported 848 per cent, as against 152 per cent for those under all other forms of ownership, while in 1904 the corresponding figures were 797 per cent and 203 per cent, respectively Similar conditions prevail to a greater or less extent in most of the industries presented separately, except that for mens olothing the greatest proportion, 388 per cent, of value -of

considerable proportion (259 -ï Includes the group \" Less than $5,000\" per cent) of the total number of establishments, but the value of their products amounted to only fivetenths of 1 per cent of the total The great bulk of the manufacturing was done in establishments having products valued at not less than $100,000 -During the five years from 1904 to 1909 there was a marked increase in the proportion of the total value of products reported by the largest establishmentsthose reporting products to the value of $1,000,000 and overand a decrease in the proportions reported by each of the four remaining classes -The fact that between 1904 and 1909 the average value of products per establishment increased from $110,466 to $129,923, and the average value added by manufacture from $43,355 to $48,259, can not be taken as in itself indicating a tendency toward concentration The increased values shown may be, and probably are, due in part to the increase that has taken place in the price

reported in 1909 by 13 establishments assigned to other classifications because they were engaged primarily in the manufacture of other products Pottery, terracotta, and fireclay productsSince the early part of the nineteenth century New Jersey has been prominent in this industry, especially in the manufacture of the finest porcelain, granite, and white -ware, owing to the abundance of valuable clays and sands easily available within the state As early as 1849 there were 30 potteries in the state, which reported products valued in the aggregate at $230,900 The influence of the successful competition of the fine wares manufactured in Trenton (which is the center of this branch of the industry in the United States) with foreignmade pottery was felt shortly after 1876 and had a decidedly stimulating e:ffect upon the industry Measured by value of products of the industry as a whole, New Jersey ranked second among the states of the Union in this industry in 1904 and 1909 The total value of products increased $1,421,897, or 121 per cent, during the fiveyear period The following table shows the value of the principal products for 1909 and 1904: -In 1909 and in 1904 New Jersey ranked first among the states in the manufacture of sanitary ware, including porcelain bath tubs, laundry tubs, etc, the -value of which increased $1,334,634, or 444 per cent1 during the fiveyear period The state also ranked first at the census of 1909 in the production of china (porcelain), bone china, delft, and belleek ware, the value of which increased $613,038, or 1306 per cent The only decrease for any class of products shown separately in the table is one of $48,407, or 38 per cent, in the value of white ware, including 0 C (cream colored) ware, and white granite, semiporcelain, and semivitreous porcelain ware Among thepottery products the largest relative gain, 1505 per cent, was in the value of porcelain electrical supplies -Paint and varnishThe quantity and value of the

of steel vessels and the decline in the building of wooden vessels during this period During the decade the gross tonnage of the steel vessels launched increased 39,023 tons, or nearly one thousand per cent, while that of wooden vessels decreased 42,928 tons, or 806 per cent Of the total tonnage of vessels of 5 tons and over launched in the state in 1909, the tonnage of steel vessels formed 806

an area of 122 460 square miles, is the fourth largest among the 49 states and territories embraced in continental United States, being exceeded in size only by Texas California, and Montana Its population in 1910 was 327,301, as compared with 195,310 in 1900 and 160 282 in 1890 It ranked fortyfourth among the 49 ~tates and territories as regards population both in 1910 and in 1900 Manufacturing in the territory is still in its infancy The mining of coal, copper, gold, and silver are of considerable importance, but the principal pursuits are stock raising and agriculture Fourteen and twotenths per cent of the entire population of the territory resides in -Albuquerque, with a population of 11,020, is the only city in the territory having a population of over 10,000 The territory is very sparsely settled, as is indicated by the fact that its density of population is only 27 per square mile -Importance and growth of manufactures,The following table gives the more important :figures relative to all classes of manufactures combined for the territory as returned at the censuses of 1909, 1904, and 1899, together with percentages of increase from census to census: -In general, this table brings out the fact that the manufacturing industries of New Mexico as a whole showed a considerable development during each of the fiveyear periods 19041909 and 18991904 Dur-ing the period 19041909 the average number of wage earners increased 191 per cent, while the value of products increased 384 per cent and the value added by ∑manufacture 336 per cent As pointed out in the Introduction, it would be improper to infer that manufactures increased in volume during the period 19041909 to the extent indicated by these figures regarding values, since the increase shown is certainly due, in part, to the increase that has taken place in the price of commodities It will be noticed that for most of the items the percentages of increase from 1899 to 1904 were larger than those from 1904 to 1909 -The relative importance and growth of the leading manufacturing industries of the territory are shown in the table on page 788 -It should be borne in mind, in considering this table, that the value of products in some of the industries involves a certain amount of duplication due to the use of the product of one establishment in the industry as material for another establishment -The important industries listed in this table, in which they are arranged in the order of the value of products, call for brief consideration -Oars and general shop construction and repairs by steamrailroad companiesThis industry represents the work done in the car shops operated by steamrailroad companies and is exclusive of minor repairs in roundhouses Although there may be a limited amount of new construction, the operations consist almost exclusively of repairs to the rolling stock and equipment of the companies reporting∑ Although there was a slight decrease shown in the total value of products from 1904 to 1909, in the latter year these shops gave employment to an average of 1,489 wage earners and reported products to the value of $2,251,000, a greater number of wage earners and a greater value of products than reported for any other manufacturing industry in the territory -Printing a,nd publishingThe majority of the establishments in this industry are small newspaper and job printing offices, and although the number of establishments is in excess of that reported for any other industry, the number of wage earners and value of products 11re not correspondingly large Employment was given to an 11verage of but 283 wage earners, and the total value of products was $589,000 -mills reported for this industry, and as a rule were small and located in the rural districts They gave employment to an average of 28 wage earners and -Measured by value added by manufacture these industries held a somewhat different rank tha~ when measu:ed by val?e of pro~ucts, the lumber industry becommg first∑ m order mstead of steamrailroad repair shops, which, in turn, becomes second, while bakery products becomes fourth in order instead of flourmill and gristmill manufactures, which, in turn, becomes fifth Owing to the comparatively simple processes involved in the latter industry, and the extent to which these processes are carried on by machinery, the value added by manufacture is not commensurate with the gross value of products or the number of the establishments -This table shows also the percentages of increase for the leading industries in respect to value of products and value added by manufacture Of the specified industries, printing and publishing shows the greatest percentage of increase from 1904 to 1909 both in value of products and in value added by manufacture -The following table shows the percentage of proprietors and officials, clerks, and wage earners, respectively, in the total number of persons employed in manufactures It covers all industries combined and four important industries individually -industries combined, the distribution of the average ∑number of wage earners by age periods and sex,

method al estimating the distribution, by sex and age periods, of the average number In all industries combined, see Introduction -For all industries combined, 964 per cent of the average number of wage earners were males over 16 years of age, 2 per cent females over 16 years of age, and 16 per cent persons of both sexes under the age of 16 The largest part of the total number of female wage

to the largest proportionate number of wage earners under 16 years of age -In order to compare the distribution of persons engaged in manufactures in 1909 with that shown at the census of 1904, it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Introduction) The following table makes this comparison according to occupational status: -This table indicates that, although

number and the smallest number of employees reported for any month The number for each month relates to the 15th day, or the nearest representative day, of that month -∑ There is no industry of importance in the territory which is distinctively seasonal, but nevertheless the number of wage earners underwent considerable change from month to month The last six months of the year showed a larger number employed than during the :first six months The number in February, the lowest month, was 788 per cent of the number in September -The lumber industry is the second industry in the territory in respect to number of wage earners employed; and the variation in this number, which is considerable, affects to some extent the totals for all industries combined This industry gave employment in 1909 to an average of 1,475 wage earners, or 356 per cent of the total number employed in all the industries of the territory Of these wage earners, an average for the year of 964, or 654 per cent, were employed in the mills, and 511, or 346 per cent, were employed in the logging branch of the -industry The maximum number of wage earners, both in the mills and in logging, was reached in the month of September, when 1,177 were employed in the former and 593 in the latter branch of the industry The smallest number employed in the mills, 814, or 692 per cent of the maximum, was in January, and the smallest number employed in logging operations, 407, or 686 per cent of the maximum, was in June -Prevailing hours of labor, In the table following wage earners have been classified according ~o hours of labor prevailing in the establishments Ill which they are employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employ~d during the year is used; and the number employed_ in each establishment is classified as a total accordmg to the hours prevailing in that establishment, even though some few employees work a greater or less number of hours -AVJlllAGE NUMBER OF WAGE EARNERS IN ESTABLISHMENTS GROUlED ACCORDING TO PREVAILING IIOURS OF WOJ1K PER WEEK -It is evident from these figures that for the great majority of w_age earners emrloyed in th~ ~anu£acturing industries of New Mexico the prevmhng hours of labor are 60 a week, or 10 a day, only 234 per cent of the total being employed in establishments working less than 10 hours a day, and only 24 per cent being employed in establishments working more than 10 hours a day -The railroad repair shops and the establishments manufacturing lumber and timber prod~cts are operated principally on a 10hourperday basis As these two industries gave employment to more than twothirds of the wage earners reported for the territory, the prevailing hours of labor reported for them largely determine the prevailing hours shown for all industries combined -Location of establishments:The next table shows the ext!lnt to which the manufacturing industries of the territory are located in the city of Albuquerque (See Introduction) -In 1909, of the total number of establishments 99 per qent were located in Albuquerque, 163 per cent of the total value of products was reported from this city, and 142 per cent of the total average number of wage earners were employed there As separate statistics for Albuquerque are not available for the censuses of 1904 and 1899, no comparison showing the growth of the manufactures of the city can be -made C_haracter of ownershipThe table th~t follows has for its purpose tl~e presentation of conditions in respect to the character of ownership, or legal organization, of ~anufacturing enterprises For all industries combmed comparative :figures are given covering the censuses of _1909 and 1904 Comparative data for 1899 -are not available Figures for

The corresponding :figures for 1904 were -266 per cent and 734 per cent, respectively For all industries combined, as measured by value of products and value added by manufacture, relatively, corpora~ tions lost ground to a slight extent \\x0c111111,-Size of establishmentThe tendency for manufacturing to become concentrated in large establishments or the reverse, is a matter of interest from the standpoint of industrial organization To throw some light upon it, the following table groups the establishments according to the value of their products The table also shows the average size of establishments for all industries combined and for important industries separately, as measured by number of wage earners, value of products, and value added by manufacture The totals for all industries are shown for the last two censuses, while for two important industries figures are given for 1909 only -623 per cent of the total number in all establishments, and reported 568 per cent of

number of establishments from 1904 to 1909 is largely in those establishments having less than $20,000 worth of products Out of a total increase of 114 establishments, only 14 reported more than $20,000 worth of products The table shows further that when the size of establishments is measured by value of products the printing and publishing industry is conducted mainly in the smaller establishments, and the lumber and timber industry mainly in establishments producing between $100 000-The following table shows, in percentages, the distribution of expenses among the classes indicated for all industries combined and for certain importantindustries separately The figures on which the percentages are based appear in Table II -463 per cent of the total expenses was incurred

New York, as well as the abundant natural wealth of its fields, forests, mines, and quarries, have contributed to its industrial development and have been instrumental in making it the leading manufacturing state of the Union The Mohawk, upper Hudson, Black, and Genesee Rivers and Niagara Falls furnish the major part of the water power, which, either directly or through the agency of transmitted electric current, serves a large percentage of the manufacturing establishments of the state The Hudson River, ,the Erie Canal, connecting Lake Erie with the Hudson River, and a system of canals which connect Lake Ontario with the Erie Canal and Lake Champlain with the Hudson River, form a network of inlancl waterways  for the exchange of various commodities within the state and furnish excellent communication by water from Duluth and Chicago in the West and fromvarious points in Canada on the north to New York City, thereby affording an outlet for coastwise and foreign commerce through the most important seaport in the United States A large majority of the commercial and manufacturing centers of the state are located on -these waterways or on the connecting waterways which border the state The 8,448 miles 2 of 1,3teamrailway trackage within the state also afford excellent transportation facilities -New York has important interests in agriculture and mining, its predominance is most marked in manufacturing Since the completion of the Erie Canal in 1825, New York has held the foremost rank in this respect, though since 1849, when the first authoritative census of manufactures was taken, the proportion which the state has contributed to the totol value of manufactured products in the entire United States has decreased somewhat This proportion was 233 per cent in 1849 and only 163 per cent in 1909 -The table on page 800 gives the most important figures relative to all classes of manufactures combined for 1909, 1904, and 1899,

plants employed an average of 4,095 wage earners and reported products valued at $9,330,918 -In general, this table shows that the manufacturing industries of New York as a whole developed at about the same rate during each of the two fiveyear periods covered by the table The earlier fiveyear period, 18991904, shows the larger percentages of increase in value added by manufacture and in number

leading manufacturing industries of the state are shown in the table on pages 801 and 802 -It should be borne in mind, in considering that table, that the value of products in some of the industries involves a certain amount of duplication, due to the use of the products of one establishment in the industry as material for other establishments -of \"All other industries\" in the table, in some instances, because the operations of individual establishments would be disclosed if they were shown separately; in others, because the returns do not present properly the true condition of the industry, for the reason that it is more or less interwoven with one or more other industries; and in still others, because comparative statistics can not be presented for either 1904 or 1899 on account of changes in classification or because such figures would disclose the operations of individual establishments1 Of the industries which are not presented separately in this table, the refining of cane sugar is of special importance, as New York contributed over onethird of the total value of products for the industry in 1909 The 1909 statistics for the manufacture of moving pictures and of signs and advertising novelties are presented separately in Table II, page 878 -∑hich are of considerable importance, not only in the ~ate hut in the United States Furthermore, it will ~e se~n from the following table, or still more clearly from Table II, where figures are given separately for an e\\\\\"en larger number of industries, that there 1s a -wide diversity in the manufacturing activities of the state With the exception of Pennsylvania, the diversity is greater in New York than in any other state in the Union Of the 264 classifications used in the presentation

each succeeding census it has formed a gri:iater proportion of the aggregate value reported fo;r the clothing industries in the∑ United States, this proportion being 452 ∑per cent in 1889 and -TextilesThe textile industries of New Yorkcomprising the manufacture of hosiery and knit goods; silk and silk goods; carpets and ;rugs, other than rag; woolen, worsted, and felt goods, and wool hats; cotton goods, including cotton small wares; cordage and twine and jute and linen goods; and furfelt hatsconsidered as a unit, rank high among the manufacturing industries of the state when measured by value of products Combined, the seven allied branches gave employment in 1909 to an average of 91,839 wage earners and manufocturecl products to the value of $185,780,000, these figures representing increases over 1904 of 11,233, or 139 per cent, in the number of wage earners and of $43,358,000, or 304 per cent, in value of pr~ducts In 1909 the textile industdes employed -91 per cent of the total number of wage earners engaged in the manufacturing industries of the state, and contributed 55 per cent of the total value of manufactured products The corresponding proportions for 1904 were 94 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively New York was the third state in the Union in the production of all textiles combined, of silk and silk goods, and of furfelt hats, first in the manufacture of hosiery and knit goods and of carpets and ;rugs, other than rag, and second in that of cordage and twine and jute and linen goods It ranked fifth in the production of woolen, worsted,∑ and felt goods, and wool hats, and eleventh in that of cotton goods, including cotton small wares Foundry and machineshop productsAll foundries and machine shops except those which manufacture a distinctive product covered by some other designation, such as agricultural implements, cash registers and calculating machines; sewing machines and attachments, or electrical machinery, are included in this classification Establishments engaged in the manufacture of bells, gas machines and gas and water meters, hardware, castiron and caststeel pipe, plumbers supplies, steam fittings and heating apparatus, and structural ironwork, the majority of which were reported under separate classifications at previous censuses, are included in this industry A number of the most important establishments are engaged in the manufacture of typesetting machines, steamheating apparatus, electric elevators, locomotive, tender, and car brakes, metalworking machinery, pumps and pumping machinery, and structural ironwork Although the industry was practically at a standstill from 1899 to 1904, the value of products increased from -LiquorsThe manufacture of malt, distilled, and vinous liquors forms a very important group of industries in New York The value of the combined output for 1909 can not be given, however, because the statistics for the distilledliquor industry can not be presented separately wjthout disclosililg the operations of individual establishments The manufacture of malt liquors was by far the most important of the three industries comprising this group The total output of this industry in 1909 was valued at $77, 720,0001 an increase over 1904 of $15,762,000, or 254 per cent, which was considerably more than double the gain for the preceding fiveyear period The :figures for both value of products and value added by manufacture in the case of the brewery industry include $12,666,000 paid to the Federal Government as internalrevenue tax, and are therefore to that ext_ent misleading as an indication of the relative importance of this industry from a purely manufacturing standpoint The distilledliquor industry shows a substantial increase from -Tobacco manefacturesWhile this designation cov\" ers in general the manufacture of cigars, cigarettes chewing and smoking tobacco, and snuff, the industr; in New York was confined largely to the manufacture of -Iron and steel, steel worlcs and, rolling mills and blast JurnacesCo:rnbined, these two allied industries gave roployment in 1909 to an average of 12,389 wage earners and the value of their products amounted to -$66 153 000 These gures represent mcreases over 1899 of  6,971, or 1287 per cent, m numb~r of wage earners and $52,295,0~0, or 3774 per cent, m value of products The classification \"Steel works and rolling mills\" includes establishments engaged in the manufacture of steel or the hot rolling of iron and steel It  also includes the making of forgings and castings and the manufacture of rolled iron and steel into more highly finished forms when conducted as a part of the rollingmill operations, as well as the few extant forges and bloomeries It does not, however, include the making of coldrolled products, nor offorgings, castings and manufactures of iron and steel by establishmedts not equipped with steelmaking furnaces or hot trains of rolls The output of the steel works and rolling mills in 1909 was valued at $39,532,000, representing an increase over 1904 of $18,305,000, or 862 per cent This gain, although pronounced, was ∑not so great relatively as the increase of $12,415,000, or -exceptionally rapid extension during recent years of the use of electricity has created a demand for electrical appliances The industry in New York, therefore, shows decided development during the past ~ecade, the value of products increasing from $22,695,000 in 1899 to $49,290,000 in 1909 Although New York retained the lead among the states in this industry, -Of the 296 establishments in the state included in this classification in 1909, 21 were engaged primarily in the manufacture of boot and shoe cut stock, 56 in the production of boot and shoe findings, and 219 in the manufacture of boots and shoes There is some overlapping of these three branches which makes it desirable to combine them in presenting the∑ statistics With products valued at $28,117,000 in 1899 and $37,521,000 in 1904, New York held second place at both censuses among the states of the Union, but in 1909, when products valued at $48,186,000 were reported, it had dropped to third place The proportions which New York contributed of the total value of products for the industry in the United States in the respective years were, however, comparatively small, owing to the fact that the state first in rank manufactured so large a percentage of the products as to dwarf, in a measure, all others ∑ These proportions were 94 per cent in 1909, 105 per cent in 1904,

of the $33,680,000 reported as the total value of products for the industry as a whole, At each of the last three censuses New York outranked all other states of the Union in the manufacture of pianos and organs and materials, contributing 375 per cent of the total value of the output for the United States in 1909, 354 per cent in 1904, and 359 per cent in 1899 The value of products for the industry in the state considerably more than doubled during the decade -Automobiles, incZU<ling bodies and partsThe manufacture of automobiles in New York began only a few years before 1899, in which year there were 15 establishments in operation in the state, reporting products valued at $456,000, and the state ranked fifth among the states in the industry The development of the industry thereafter was remarkable, for by 1904 New York had become third in the manufacture of automobiles, which position it retained in 1909 In 1899 New York contributed 96 per, cent of the total value of products for this industry in the country as a whole, and in 1904 the proportion had increased to 142 per cent, but in 1909 it had dropped to 124 per cent The total value of products for 1909 was $30,980,000, which was more than seven times the amount reported for 1904 This classification also includes the manufacture of automobile parts and accessories, but this branch of the industry has become -so interwoven with such industries as the foundry and machineshop industry and the manufacture of rubber goods, electrical machinery, apparatus, and supplies, and brass and bronze products that it is impossible to ∑ determine to what extent the statistics presented under this head cover the actual production of parts -manufacture Where this is the case, it indicates that the cost of materials represents a large proportion of the total value of products, and that therefore the value added by manufacture, of which wages constitute usually the largest item, is only a small proportion of the total value of products Thus the slaughtering and meatpacking industry, which ranks :fifth in gross value of products, and the flourmill and gristmill industry, which ranks tenth in that respect, rank comparatively low with regard to number of wage earners and value added by manufacture Other important industries which rank much higher in gross value of products than in the number of wage earners or the value added by manufacture are the butter, cheese, and condensedmilk industry; the tanning, currying, and finishing of leather; the blast furnaces; the roasting and grinding of coffee and spice; and the manufacture of linseed oil -On the other hand, there are several industries the rank of which according to the number of wage earners or the value added by manufacture is considerably higher than the tank according to the value of products; in other words, the cost of materials is relatively a smaller part of the total value of products for these industries than for most others Among the important industries of this class are the manufacture of fumiture and refrigerators, the steamrailroad repair∑shops, and marble and stone work Four of the textile industriesthe manufacture of hosiely and knit goods, silk goods, carpets and rugs, and cotton goodsalso rank much higher in number of wage earners, and somewhat higher in value added by manufacture, than in value of products -The table on page 801 shows very great differences among the several industries with respect to the∑ percentages of increase or decrease in the value of products and the value added by manufacture, although the great majority of the industries show an increase in both items for each of the fiveyear periods The reducti~n and refining of gold and silver from sweepings, clippings, and sclap, however, shows a decrease in value of products for both fiveyear periods, while 13 other industries show decreases from 1904 to 1909 and 15 decreases from 1899 to 1904 None of the industries presented separately in the table show decreases in value added by manufacture for both fiveyear periods,∑ but∑ 16 show decreases from 1904 to 1909, and 14 show decreases

period, 37 per cent, and the manufacture of dentists materials the largest in value added by manufacture, 421 per cent -Persons engaged in manufacturing industriesThe following table shows, for 1909, the distribution of the number of persons engaged in manufactures, the average number of wage earners being distributed by sex and age It should be borne in mind, however, that the sex and age classification of the average number of wage earners in this and other tables is an estimate o btainecl by the method described in the Introduction -The table on the following page shows, for 1909, the percentages of proprietors and officials, clerks, end wage earners, respectively, among the total numb~~ of persons employed in manufactures It ~overs  industries combined and 58 important mdustries individually -Of the total number of persons engaged in all manufacturing industries, 66 per cent were proprietors and officials, 10 per cent clerks, and 834 per cent wage earners The highest percentage of proprietors and officials shown for any industry, 356, is for the manufacture of butter, cheese, and condensed milk In this, as well as in the flourmill and gristmill industry, the majority of the establishments are small and the work is to a large extent clone by the proprietors or their immediate representatives, so that the proportion of persons engaged in these industries falling into the class of proprietors and officials is Very much higher than in other individual industries or∑ in all industries combined Similar conditions -prevail to some extent in the bakery industry, in canning and preserving, in the manufacture of carriages and wagons, fur goods, and patent medicines and compounds and druggists preparations, in marble and stone work, and in tobacco manufactures, where the proportions of proprietors and officials ranged from -156 per cent to 118 per cent of the total number of persons engaged in each industry On account of the large average number of wage earners employed in the establishments manufacturing carpets and rugs, cordage and twine, and cotton goods, and in the blast furnaces, steel works and rolling mills, and wireworks, these industries show the smallest proportions of proprietors and officials of any given in the table The largest proportion of wage earners, 97 per cent, was reported for the carpet and rug industry, while the smallest, 552 per cent, was for the manufacture of patent medicines and compounds and druggists preparations Among the industries presented separately in the above table, however, the patentmedicine industry shows the largest proportion of clerks The first table on the following page shows, for 1909, in percentages, for all industries combined, the distribution of the average number of wage earners by age periods, and for those 16 years of age and over by sex, calculated in the manner described in the Introduction It also shows, for some of the important industries separately, a similar distribution of the wage earners reported for December 15, or the nearest representative day AB a means of judging the importance of the several industries the average number employed for the year is also given in each case -For all industries combined, 70 per cent of the average number of wage earners in 1909 were males 16 years of age and over; 292 per cent, females 16 years of age and over; and eighttenths of 1 per cent, children under the age of 16 The larger part of the total number of female wage earners 16 years of age and over was made up of those employed in the clothing, textile, millinery and lace goods, tobacco manufactures, and mens furnishing goods industries; the industry having the largest proportion of won!en, however, was the manufacture of artificial flowers and feathers and plumes, in which such wage earners formed 842 per cent of the total In the manufacture of mens furnishing goods, and of millinery and lace goods, over threefourths of the wage earners were women 16 years of age and over; in the hosiery and knit goods, fancy and paper box, and silk and silk goods industries, over threefifths; and in s?ven other industries shown in the table the proportion was over onehalf  -The textile, clothing, printing and publishing, boot and shoe, fancy and paper box, and millinery and lace goods industries employed the larger part of the wage earners under 16 years of age The proportion of such wage earners was largest (29 per cent) in the manufacture of fancy and paper boxes while -in the cottongoods industry they formed 28 per cent of the total number, and in the silkgoods industry 25 per cent The proportion was also relatively high in the manufacture of artificial flowers and feathers and plumes, jewelry, boots and shoes, confectionery, and woolen goods, in each of which children under 16 years of age formed at least 2 per cent of the total number of wage earners -In order to compare the distribution of persons engaged in manufactures in 1909 with that shown at the census of 1904 it is necessary to use the classification employed at the earlier census (See Intro-Comparable figures are not obtainable for 1899 ?alaried employees show the greatest percentage of mcrease and the only gain in relative numerical -importance The following table shows the average number of wage earners distributed according to age periods and in the case of those 16 years of age and ove; according to sex, for 1909, 1904, and 1399 The averages for 1909 are estimated on the basis of the actual number reported for a single representative day (See Introduction) -This table indicates that for all industries combined there has been both an absolute and a relative decrease during the 10 years in the employment of children under 16 years of age Although the number of each class of wage earners 16 years of age and over shows a decided increase during the same period, the proportions of such employees remained practically the same In 1909 males 16 years of age and over formed 70 per cent of all wage earners in the manufacturing industries, as compared with 704 pel cent in 1904 and 693 per cent in 1899 -Wage earners employed, by monthsThe first table s:,n the following page gives the number of wage earners employed on the 15th of each month during the year 1909 for all industries combined It gives also the percentage which the number reported for each month is of the greatest number reported for any month In Table II, page 878, are shown, for practically all of the important industries in the state, the largest number and also the smallest number of wage earners reported for any month The figures are for the 15th day, or the nearest representative day, of the month -There were no seasonal industries of importance in New York, nor did any of the more important industries show very great fluctuations from month to month in the number of wage earners employed ,Among the seasonal industries the greatest relative variations took place in canning and preserving and in the manufacture of brick and tile, but the numbers of wage earners employed in these industries were not large enough to affect very greatly the totals for the entire state There was a larger absolute variation in the number of wage earners engaged in the womens -clothing industry than in either of the seasonal industries mentioned, but these fluctuations were due mainly to trade conditions which affected to a less extent many other industries, and tlllough them the totals for the state as ∑a whole In all manufacturing industries combined, the smallest number of wage earners, 9451356, were employed in the month of January, and the largest number, 1,06311621 in the month of October, the difference between these figures being 117,806, or 111 per cent of the maximum -Prevailing hours of labor,In the following table wage earners have been classified according to the hours of labor prevailing in the establish:inents in which they are employed In making this classification the average number of wage earners employed during the year is used, and the number employed in each establishment is

industries, and more than half of those in the slaughtering and meatpacking, bakery, ∑brick and tile, and lumber industries, however, were -employed in establishments where the usual hours were 60 per week The majority of the wage earners engaged in the blastfurnace and in the gas industries worked more than 72 hours per week, while in marble and stone work, in printing and p11blishing, and in several smaller industries the prevailing hours of labor for a majority of the wage earners were 48 or less per week -Location of establishmentsThe following table shows the extent to which the manufactures of New York are centralized in cities or villages of 10,000 inhabitants or over (See Introduction) Statistics for Lackawanna, a city having over 10,000 inhabitants, whose manufactures are practically all carried on by a single corporation, are included with those for the sections of the state outside of such cities and villages, so as to avoid the disclosure of individual operations -In 1909, 868 per cent of the total value of products for all manufacturing industries in the state was reported from cities and villages having over 10,000 inhabitants, and 853 per cent of the average number ïof wage earners were employed in such cities and villages While comparatively little change occurred during the decade, the industries located in incorporated places of this size were somewhat more important relatively and those located outside of such places somewhat less important in 1909 than in 1899 -It s)iould be borne in mind, in considering this table, that the increase in the ,population of certain cities and villages between 1900 and 1910 has caused considerable change in the makeup of some of the groups shown in the table Eleven placesWhite Plains, Olean, Port Chester, North Tonawanda, Batavia, ∑Cortland, Ossining, Hudson, Plattsburg, Rensselaer, and Fultonwhich had more than 10,000 inhabitants in 1910, had less than that number in 1900, so that for 1899 their statistics are not included with those for ~c?rporated places having a populat;ion above that linnt The total value of products reported for these 11 places in 1909 was $55,595,612, or 16 per cent of the total shown for the entire state If the figures for these places were subtracted from those shown in the table for cities and villages of 10,000 inhabitants or over for 1909 and added to those for the remainder of the state, -the proportion for the former would be 852 per cent and for the latter 148 per cent of the aggregate These percentages would therefore represent the proportions of the total value of products in 1909 reported for the same areas for which statistics are given for 1899 In 1900 Jamestown, Amsterdam, Mount Vernon, Niagara Falls, New Rochelle, Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, Watertown, and Kingston were cities of the first group10,000 to 25,000 inhabitantsbut during the following decade the population of each so increased that in 1~10 all were cities of the second group251000 to 100,000 inhabitants Albany was a city of the second group in 1900, but by 1910 the increase in the population enabled it to be classed in the third group100,000 inhabitants or over -Each of the three groups int~ which the incorporated places of 10,000 inhabitants or over are divided in the table shows a substantial increase in number of manufacturing establishments, average number of wage earners, value of manufactured products, and value added by manufacture in 1909 as compared with 1899, except that the group comprising the cities and villages having between 10,000 and 25,000 inhabitants shows a decrease in number of establishments and average number of wage earners, clue principally to the changes in its composition which have already been referred to -ï

for 1909, 1904, and 1899, so far as :figures are available Lackawanna is not included in that table, for reasons already referred to -Every city or village for which comparative statistics are available shows an increase in value of products, and all but seven an increase in the number of wage earners, for the decade 18991909 For the fiveyear period 19041909 all except fiveDunkirk, Hudson, Ithaca, Watervliet, and Corning___:show increases in value of products, and all except nine increases in the number of wage earners The largest decrease in value of products during this period, $3,333,596, or 336 per cent, took place in Dunkirk, and was the result of the decline in the output of the locomotive works, which constituted the leading :industry in that city The decrease in Hudson was due mainly to the decline in the production of cement, while the loss in Corning was chiefly in the value of founch∑y and machineshop products, two plants engaged in this branch of manufacture having moved to Rochester since 1904, and one having gone out of business The other two cities showing losses in value of products are comparatively small industrial centers whose manufactures cover

first place in the total value of manufactured products as well as in many individual industries In 1909 the population of New York City was practically equal to that of the state of Ohio and exceeded only by PennsylvaniaJ Illinois, and NewYorkitself, but thevalue of its man1Jfactured products exceeded that reported by any state except Pennsylvania and New York This predominance in manufactures is connected closely with the abundant supply of labor, its large immigrant population being in particular an influential factor in causing manufacturing enterprises to locate there New York City is the chief center of trade between the United States and Europe and also one of the principal distributing points for domestic trade This commercial importance has also contributed greatly to the high rank of the city in manufacturing industries and to making New York the :financial center of the United States, thereby rendering it easy to obtain capital for the establishment and extension of such industries -There were 21 industries in New York City in 1909 for which a value of products in excess of $20,000,000 was reported For 2 of these industries, the refining of cane sugar and the smelting and refining of copper, statistics can not be presented separately without disclosing the operations of individual establishments The other 19 industries, arranged in order of value of products, are indicated in the following tabular state-ment, which shows the absolute and relative increase in this respect between 1904 and 1909, and also the percentage which the value of products for each industry represents of the corresponding total for the state: -It will be noted that for :five of the industries included in the preceding tabular statement more than 90 per cent of the total value of products for the state was reported from New York City, the proportion rising as high as 99,7 per cent in the case of the manufacture of artificial flowers and feathers and plumes In seven other industries the establishments located in New York City contributed more than threefourths of the total value of products for the state For only two industries included in the tablethe foundry and machineshop and the lumber industrieswas less than onehalf of the total value of products for the state reported from New York City -379 per cent of tlie average number of wage earners engaged in all manufacturing industries In addition to the 118 industries presented separately for New York City in Table I, page 858, there were 99 others which, for various reasons, are in~ eluded under the head of \"All other industries\" Some of these industries were among the most impor-Of the five boroughs which form New York City, the Borough of Manhattan is the most important industrially, the value of the manufactured products reported by the establishments within its limits in 1909 constituting 684 per cent of the total for the entire city The ~oportions of the total contributed by the other boroughs in that year were as follows: Brooklyn, 206 per cent; Queens, 75 per cent; the Bronx, 21 per cent; and Richmond, 15 per cent Each borough made substantial gains from 1904 to 1909 in all items covered by the manufactures statist,ics, with the single exception that the Borough of Richmond shows a decrease in the number of proprietors and firm members The relative increase in value of products was much greater in the boroughs of Richmond and Queens, however, than in the city as a whole, while in the Borough of Brooklyn it was considerably less, the percentages of increase being as follows: New York City, 33; Borough of Richmond, -761; Borough of Queens, 632; Borough of Brooklyn, 117; and the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx combined, 37 2 The leading industries in the Borough of Manhattan were to a large extent the same as those previously enumerated for the city as a whole, while in the Borough of Brooklyn refined sugar was the leading product; in the Borough of Queens, smelted and refined copper; in the Borough of the Bronx, pianos and organs and materials; and in the Borough of Richmond, soap -The totals presented for New York City do not include the statistics for three establishments operated by the Federal Government, namely, the United States navy yard, with 3,622 wage earners and products valued at $7,032,416 in 1909; the United States Naval Clothing Factory, with 96 wage earners and products valued at $670,198, located in Brooklyn; ancl the United States Lighthouse Establishment, with 60 wage earners and products, such as illuminating and signal apparatus and machinery and other lighthouse supplies, valued at $995,745, located at Tompkinsville, in the Borough of Richmond -Ranked by value of products, Buffalo was ninth the cities of

linseed oil, and the smelting and refining of copper, which ∑are also among the principal industlies of the city, are not included in the above table, since statistics for these three industries can not be presented separately without disclosing the operations of individual establishments More than onehalf of the value of the linseed oil manufactured in New York in 1909 was, however, repo1∑ted from Buffalo  -In addition to the 43 industries shown separately for Buffalo in Table I, page 856, and the 3 industries referred to in the preceding paragraph, there were a number of others which, for reasons similat to those given in the discussion of the corresponding g;roup for the state as a whole (p 800), are included under the head of \"All other industries\" in Table I Some of these industries were among the more important in the city; in fact, 13 reported products between $1,000,000 and $5,000,000 in value for 19092 -roducts, and 7,329, or 231 per cent, in ~he ~verage pumber of

the value of thefr products, are the making of mens clothing, the manufacture of photographic apparatus and materials the manufacture of boots and shoes, the foundx∑y and machineshop industry, and printing and publishing The larger part of the photographic apparatus and materials manufactured in New York are made in Rochester, while 279 per cent of the value of products for the boot and shoe industry of the state in 1909, over onehalf of that for the opticalgoods industry, and 194 11er cent of that for the button industry were reported from this city -In addition to the 40 industries shown separately for Rochester in Table I, page 871, there were 12 other industries having a value of products in excess of $500,000 in 1909 which are included under the head of \"All other industries,\" 1 some of these being among the mostdmportant industries of the city -The manufacturing activities of Yonkers were confined largely to :five industries which, named in order of their relative importance as measured by value of products, were as follows: Sugar refining, not including beet sugar; caipets and rugs, other than rag; furfolt hats; foundry and machineshop products; and rubber goods, \"not elsewhere specified\" With the exception of the foundry and machineshop industry, less than three establishments were reported for each of these inclustries, so that their statistics can not be presented separately without disclosing the operations of individual establishments -1 These industries, named in order of the value of products, are: Pphotogmphic apparatus and materials Cordials and s!rups-;;annlng and preserving preparations,tatianery goods, not elsewhere spec!Leather goodsfled Hosiery !Ind knit goods-supplies and the construction of steamrailroad locomotives Three establishments were reported for the former industry and one for tlie latter, but the statistics for these industries can not be presented separately without disclosing the operations of individual establishments It may be stated, however, that these two industries contributed the bulk of the total value of products shown for all manufacturing industries in the city combined The city as a whole shows an increase in 1909, as compared with 1904, of $5,080,248, or 154 per cent, in value of products and 615, or 43 per cent, in the average number of wage earners -Troy, which shows an increase for the :five years from 1904 to 1909 of $6,119,157, or 192 per cent, in value of products, and of 906, or 47 per cent, in the average number of wage earners, owes its importance in manufactures mainly to the collar and cu:ff branch of the mens furnishinggoods industry, the me11s clothing industry, and the output of the steel works and rolling mills, breweries, founchies and machine shops, and knitting mills These 6 industries combined reported products in 1909 valued at $29,252,466, or 77 per cent of the total value of products for the city Troy is lmown tlu∑oughout the country as a center for the manufacture of collars and cuffs The 21 establishments which were engaged in this branch of manufacturing in Troy during 1909 reported products valued at $13,638,745, which represented 858 per cent of the total value of such products for the state and 792 per cent of the total for the Dnitecl States -Utica is one of the leading cities of the state in the manufacture of textiles During 1909 there were 15 knitting mills, 3 cotton mills, 1 worsted mill, and 1 cordage and twine mill in operation in the city, which together gave employment to an average of 7,725 wage earners and reported products valued at $15,977,371, representing 587 per cent and 512 per cent of the respective totals for the city Other industries of particular importance, as measured by value of products, were the making of mens clothing and the foundry and machineshop1 brewery, and lumber industries For all industries combined the increases in 1909 over 1904 were $8,318,944, or 364 per cent, in value of products, and 2,271, or 209 per cent, in average 1mmber of wage earners -Niagara Falls is the center of the chemical industry in the state, the value of its chemical products in 1909 amounting to $11,996,726, which was 339 per cent of the total for the industry in the state, and also represented 419 per cent of the total value of products for all manufacturing industries of the city combined Furthermore, Niagara Falls far outranks all,othercities of the United States in the manufacture of chemical substances by electrolytic processes, this branch of the chemict1,l industry having developed very rapidly as a -result of the utilization of the water power of the falls for the generation of electric current Other industries of importance in 1909 were the manufacture of food preparations, the flourmill and gristmill industry, and the manufacture of paper and wood pulp, silverwareand plated ware, and emery and other abrasive wheels -Albany shows an increase in 1909 over 1904 of $2,616,987, or 129 per cent, in value of products, and 885, or 99 per cent, in the average number of wage earners The manufacturing interests of this city

almost exclusively confined to that industry, which is represented mainly by two establishments, and for this reason the statistics for the city can not be presented separately, for to do so∑ would disclose the operations of these establishments -(Pencil comment Arthur7/21/2020 5:16:44 PMblank)Character of ownershipThe table on page 819 has for its purpose the presentation of conditions in respect to the character of ownership, or legal organization, of manufacturing enterprises For all industries combined comparative figures are given covering the censuses of 1909 and 1904 Comparative data for 1899 are not available Figures for 1909 only are presented for several important industries individually In order to avoid disclosing the operations of individual concerns it is necessary to omit several important industries from this table and the one following The most important distinction ∑shown is that be-tween corporate and all other forms of ownership, For all industries combined, 208 per cent of the total number of establishments were in 1909 under corporate ownership, as against 792 per cent under all other forms The corresponding figures for 1904 were 16,4 per cent and 836 per cent, respectively Of the total value of products, however, the establishments operated by corporations reported 62 6 per cent in 1909, as against -374 per cent reported by those under all other forms of ownership, while in 1904 the corresponding figures were 561 per cent and 439 per cent, respectively The greatest decrease in relative numerical importance from 1904 to 190f) is shown for establishments operated by individuals, w:hich represented 565 per c∑ent of the total number of establishments in 1909, as compared with 594 per cent in 1904 Among the industries given separately in the table, the gas industry shows the greatQJSt proportion of the total value of products reported by establishments under the corporate form of owner∑ ship, namely, 999 per cent The largest percentage for establishments operated by :firms was 557 per cent in the manufacture of mens clothing, and for thos~ owned by individuals, 334 per cent, in the carriage and wagon industry -1 Includes the group \"Other,\" to avoid dlsclosureofindividual operations , Includes the group \"Firm,\" to avoid disclosure of individual operations -Size of establishmentThe tendency for manufacturing to become concentrated in large establishments, or the reverse, is a matter of interest from the standpoint of industrial organization In order to throw some light upon it the table on page 821 groups the establishments according to the value of their products The table also shows the average size of establish-ments for all industries combined and for important industries separately as measured by number of wage earners, value of products, and value added by ~anufacture The totals for all industries are shown m the table f~r the last two censuses, while for the industries separately the :figures given are confined to the cen9us of 1909 -On the other hand, the very small establishmentsthat is, those having a value of products of less than $5,000constituted a considerable proportion (273 per cent) of the total number of establishments, but the value of their products amounted to only ninetenths of 1 per cent of the total The great bulk of the manufacturing was done in establishments having products valued at $100,000 or over -It will be seen from the above table that during the five years from 1904 to 1909 there was a considerable increase in the relative importance, as measured by value of products, of the largest establishmentsthose reporting products valued at $1,000,000 or overand a slight decrease in that of all other -values may be, and probably are, due in part to the increase that has taken place in the prices of commodities The average number of wage earners per establishment decreased from 23 to 22 -This table shows further that when the size of the establishments is measured by the average value of products per establishment, the chemical, brewery, and slaughtering and meatpacking industries were conducted in comparatively large establishments, while the carriage and wagon, marble and stone work, tobacco manufactures, and lumber industries were conducted in rather small establishments -Of the industries shown separately, slaughtering and meat packing had the largest establishments, with an average value of products amounting to $534,160, and the carriage and wagon industry the smallest, with products valued on the average at $21,791 per establishment -In some respects, and especially from the standpoint of conditions under which persons engaged in manuf actures work, the best classification of establishments to bring out the feature of size is a classification according to the number of wage earners employed The table on the following page shows, for 1909, such a classification for all industries combined and for 58 important industries individually, and gives not only the number of establishments in each group, but also the average number of wage earners employed -(Pencil comment Arthur7/21/2020

and the next of the 10,524 establishments employing from 6 to 20 wage earners There were∑ 585 establishments that employed over 250 wage earners; 58 of these employed over 1,000, of which 4 each were engaged in the foundry and machineshop and printing and publishing industries, and tobacco manufactures, and 3 each in the automobile, carpet and rug, cottongoods, hosiery and knitgoods, and steel works and rollingmill industries Of the total number of wage earners, 336 per cent wore in establishments employing over 250 wage earners The single group having the largest number of wage earners was the group comprising the establishments employing from 101 to 250 This group employed 189,485 wage earners, or 189 per cent of the total number In 21 of the 58 industries listed separately in the table, establishme1its employing more thn,n 250 wage earners reported more than onehalf of the total number employed in each industry In 11 of these industries, establishments employing over 500 wage earners reported more than onehalf of the total number, while in 7, establishments employing over 1,000 wage earners reported more than onehalf of the total The highest proportion (839 per cent) -of wage earners employed ~y establishments reporting an average of more than 1,000 was in the manufacture of carpets and rugs -ExpensesAs stated in the Introduction, the census does not purport to furnish figures that can be used for determiniIig the cost of manufacture and profits Facts of interest can, however, be brought out concerning the relative importance of the different classes of expense which make up the total The :first table on the following page shows, in percentages, for 1909, the distribution of expenses among the classes indicated, for all industries combined and for certain important industries separately The figures on which the percentages are based appear in Table II, page 878 -622 por cent of the total expenses were incurred for materials, 249 per cent for servicesthat is, salaries and wagesand 129 per cent for other purposes As would be expected, these proportions vary greatly in the different industries The largest proportions shown for the various classes of expenses in the industries presented separately are as follows: For salaries, 177 per cent, in printiI1g and publishing; for wages, 451 per cent in the steamrailroad repair shops; for

industries separately in 1909, 1904, and 1899: -Hosiery and knit goodsThe manufacture of hosiery and knit goods as a factory industry in New York had its beginning in Cohoes in 1832, with the founding of a factory in which power was for the first ~ime successfully used in the making of knit goods (See History of Cohoes, by∑ Masten, pp 61, 62, and 77) In 1849 there were only 3 lrrlitting mills in the state, the value of their products amounting to only $37,000, but in 1859 there were 22 mills in operation and the totnl production was valued at $1,944,000 The industry has continued this rapid development, the value of products in 1909 being more than thirtyfour times the value reported in 1859 -384 per cent, in cost were reported All other materials for which :figures as to both quantity and cost are given show increases in both respects from 1904 to 1909, with the exception of foreign and domestic wool, and the yarns included under the head of \"All other yarns,\" which decreased in both respects, and of merino yarn, which shows a decrease in quantity only The gains in the quantity and costof silk and spunsilk yarns are particularly noteworthy, as the quantity more than trebled and the cost very nearly trebled during the :five years The quantity and value of the various products reported at the last three censuses were as follows: -From 1904 to 1909 there was a general increase in the quantity and the value of all products, with the exception of the shirts and drawers included under the head of \"All other,\" and of hoods, scarfs, and nubias, which decreased in both respects, and of meril1o shirts and drawers, which decreased in quantity only The output and the value of merino and \"All other\" shirts and drawers and of merino combination suits were less in 1904 than in 1899, and the output of All other\" combination suits also shows a decrease for that period The most important products were cotton shirts and drawers, the value of which formed -The cost of the materials used in the silk industry slightly more than doubled during the decade 18991909, that of silk in its various forms representing about fourfifths of the total at each census Raw silk, which is by far the most important single item, as measured by cost, increased 810,536 po\\\\mds, or -With tho exception of Jacquard broad silks, ladies dress trimmings, and the products included under the head of \"All other products,\" the value of each class of products shown in the table increased from 1904 to 1909 The most pronounced decrease was in J acquard silks, amounting to $448,482, or 532 per cent, owing to the removnl from the state of two estnblishments in which such fabrics were manufactured extensively in 1904 Ribbons, although the leading class of products next to broad silks in 1904 and 1909, have represented a smaller proportion of the total value of products at each succeeding census since 1899 The proportions which the value of broad silks, the class of products first in importance in 1909 and 1904, formed of the total for all products were 341 per cent in 1899, -Carpets and rugs, other th~n ragThe quantity and cost of the drff ~rent materials and the quantity and :alue of the cluef products _reported for this industry m 1909, 1904, and 1899 are given in the following table: -Woolen, worsted, and felt goods, and wool hatsThe 64 establishments reported for this industry, in 1909, classified according to their products of chief value, comprised 30 woolen mills, 15 worsted mills, 12 felt mills, and 7 woolhat factories -574 per cent of the total cost reported for all materials in 1909, 637 percent in 1904, and 562 per cent in 1899 Worsted yarns purchased show larger relative gains from 1904 to 1909 than any other class of materials, the quantity reported in 1909 being more than four times as great as in 1904, and the cost more than five times as great, while from 1899 to 190ï1: shoddyI mungo, and wool extract show the largest relative gain in quantity, and animal hair and fur the largest relative gain in value For the :fiveyear period 19041909 tailors clippings, raw cotton, shoddy, and silk and spunsilk yarns all show a decrease in both quantity and cost, while domestic wool shows a decrease in quantity only The quantity and value of the chief products reported for the industry in 1909, 1904, and 1899 are shown in the following table: -in the manufacture of other woven goods containing cotton The output of felt cloth in 1909 was more than double that in 1904 The total value of the worsted yams manufactured for sale was $1,184,521 in 1909, as compared with $793,285 in 1904 and $701,166 in 1899 To the extent that the partly manufactured products, such as yarn, noils, and waste, were sold by the establishments producing them to other establishments in the state engaged in the woolen industry for use as materials in their manufacturing processes, the value of such materials represents a duplication in the total cost of materials and value of products for the industry -Cotton goods, including cotton small wares,The quantity and cost of the principal materials used in this industry and the quantity and value of the chief products reported for 1909, 1904, and 1899 are given in the following table: -was more than counterbalanced by an increase dur~ the next :five years The value of each class f ucts

in New York engagedgin :: cottongoods mdustry for use as material in their m -f acturmg processes, their value represents a dupli tion in both the total cost of materials and the to~: value of products for the state -Furfelt h~tsThis industry includes the manufacture of derbies and soft felt hats, and of felt hats for womens wear, from rabbit, coney, and nutria fur The quantity and cost of materials used and th~ number and value of furfelt hats manufactured in 1909, 1904, nncl 1899 are shown in the following table: -Slaughtering and meat packingThe first table on the following page gives the quantity and cost oi the different materials used in the industry during the census years 1909, 1904, and 1899 -orted for each class of animals also increased during ihe same period, and even more rapidly than the number ,The cost of dressed meat purchased, however, which more than doubled between 1904 and 1909, shows a higher rate of increase for that period than any other item presented in the table -With the exception of the quantity of oleo oil and t~o numbe! of sheep pelts, the output of each of the different products shown separately increased both∑in quantity and in value from 1904 to 1909, but the percentages of increase in the value of meat products were considerably larger than those in quantity owing to the generally higher prices that prevailed in 1909 -The increase in quantity, however, which is not influenced by such external conditions as changing prices, indicates more accurately the actual growth of the industry -Lumber and timber productsAccording to some authorities the first sawmills operated in the territory now comprised within the limits of the United States were erected at New Amsterdam and Fort George on the Hudson River early in the seventeenth century  Lumbering has been one of the leading industries in New York state from the beginning, and while its maximum annual production was reached and passed more than a decade ago, the industry still ranks ninth among the industries of the state in value of products and seventh in average 11umber of wage earners employed -The following statement shows the quantity of rough lumber, lath, and shingles produced by the sawmills of the state in 1909 and 1899: -As indicated by the figures, the quantity of lumber cut in New York decreased 224 per cent from 1899 to 1909, and the output of shingles 427 per cent, while there was an increase of 66 per cent in the production of lath In 1899 about threefourths of all the lumber -cut in the state was softwood, while in 1909 the softwood varieties constituted only 594 per cent of the total In 1909 more lumber was sawed from hemlock than from any other species, the quantity being 162,784 M feet board measure, cir 239 per cent of the entire production Spruce and white pine were next in order, with 127,864 M feet and 104,658 M feet, ,respectively While 11 varieties of hardwood lumber were reported in 1909, maple, beech, oak, and basswood, ranking in the order named, were the species cut in largest quantities, and together contributed 686 per cent of the total output of hardwood lumber in New York in that year -Flourmill and gristmill productsNew York ranks first among the states in the quantity of corn, buckwheat, and oats ground during 1909, third in that of wheat and rye, and sixth in that of barley The following table shows the quantity and value of the different products for 1909, 1904, and 1899: -Whcat Hour, which contributed slightly more than onehalf of the total valuo of all products at each census, shows an increase of 179 per cent in quantity and 266 per cent in value for the period 19041909, as compared with an increase of 112 per cent in quantity and 517 per cent in value for the period 18991904 The output of offal, which consists mainly of bran and middlings, the byproducts from the flour mills, decreased threetenths of 1 per cent in quantity from 1904 to 1909, but increased 185 per cent in value; for the earlier fiveyear period, however, it shows an increase of 934 per cent in quantity and 1468 per cent in value Feed, which consists largely of corn and oats grouncl together, was the second product in importance at each census, and shows an increase of -586 per cent in quantity and 81 per cent in value for the period 19041909; between 1899 and 1904, however, there was a decrease in the output, though its value increased 257 per cent The output of corn meal and corn flour increased in both quantity and value during the earlier fiveyear period, hut decreased 1fl∑n bott respect? during _the iater period Buckwheat -Paper and wood pulpOf the total of 178 paper and pulp mills in the state in 1909, 27 were engaged exclusively in the manufacture of wood pulp, 100 made paper only, and 51 produced both pulp and paper The wood pulp manufactured in mills producing pulp exclusively was used largely as material by the paper mills of the st11te, and to the extent that it was so used its value represents a duplication both in the total cost of materials and in the total value of products shown for tho industry -of pulp wood were used in the industry, of whicfl imported spruce formed 44:3 per cent; domestic spruce,417 per cent; domestrn poplar, 57 per cent; and imported poplar, 19 per cent -The quantity and value of the different products manufactured during the last three census years are shown in the following table: -Of the total quantity of wood pulp manufactured in the state in 1909, including that used in the mills where it was made, 597 per cent was ground wood pulp, 345 per cent sul1)hite fiber, and 58 per cent soda :fiber, while in 1899, 622 per cent of the total quantity was ground wood pulp, 317 per cent was sulphite fiber, and 62 per cent soda fiber, a comparison of the :figures showing a slight increase in the proportion of sulphite :fiber during the decade Fiftyeight and eighttenths per cent of the pulp manufactured in 1909 was used in the mills where it was made, as compared with 611 per cent in 1904 and 457 per cent in 1899 Of the pulp manufactured for sale or for use in other mills in 1909, 359 per cent was ground wood pulp, while 523 per cent was sulphitefiber, and 119 per cent was soda fiber In 1904 and 1899, however, ground wood pulp constituted more than onehalf the total quantity of pulp manufactured for sale The figures given in the table show that there has been a marked increase, especially since 1904, in the amount of sulphite and soda :fiber manufactured for sale, and a considerable decrease in the amount of ground wood pulp, though the total amount of each kind of pulp manufactured shows an increase throughout the decade The value of sulphite :fiber constituted more than onehalf the total value of pulp manufactured for sale in each census year, amounting in 1909 to 633 per cent -The :first table on the following page shows the number and capacity of the Fourdrinier and cylinder machines used in the paper mills, and of the grinders and digesters used in the pulp mills in 1909, 1904, and 1899 -same time; from 1899 to 1904 the increase in the number of machines was relatively small, but their capacity increased 441 per cent Fourdrinier machines formed more than half the total number in 1904 and 1899, but in 1909 they were considerably outnumbered by the cylinder machines, which are generally used in the manufacture of tissue paper, boards, and certain other special kinds of paper The average capacity of the Fourdrinier machines, however, was more than twice as great as that of the cylinder machines, so that the former still represented in 1909 more than twothirds of the total papermaking capacity The number of pulp grinders decreased somewhat from 1904 to 1909, but their yearly capacity increased 118,733 tons, or 21 per centj the number of sulphite digesters increased from 84 to 93, and their capacity increased 75,338 tons, or 323 per centj and the number of soda digesters remained unchanged, while their capacity increased 12,161 tons, or 374 per -Of the total number of pairs of boots and shoes manufactured in New York in 1909, 368 per cent were machine or hand welt sewed, 267 per cent were McKay sewed, 252 per cent were turned, and 112 per cent manufactured by other methods, the latter class comprising wire~crew or metalfastened, and woodenpegged shoes More than half of the total number of mens boots and shoes were 0£ the lastmentioned types About twofifths , of the boys and youths boots an9shoes and more than half of the slippers were manufactured by the McKay process Almost half of the womens boots and shoes were made by the machine or hand welt process, and more than half of the misses and childrens boots and shoes, together with nearly all of the infants shoes and slippers, were turned -count of the radical change in the method of han g milk which has taken place in the last decade Forï merly it was a common practice for the farmer to sell -The output of cheese increased in quantity but <lecreased in value from 1899 to 1904, while from 1904 to 1909, though it decreased 208 per cent in quantity it increased 319 per cent in value From 1899 to 1904 both the total quantity and the total value of butter increased decidedly, but from 1904 to 1909 its value increased much less rapidly and its quantity decreased m?re than onefifth The total output of condensed rmlk increased substantially in both quantity and value during the decade -follows: Cheese, 33 per cent; butter, 75 per cent; and condensed milk, 281 per cent Measured by value of products, New York held first place among the states in the manufacture of condensed milk, second in tho manufacture of cheese, and fourth in the manufacture of butter -Gas, illuminating and heatingThe following table shows the quantity and cost of the different materials used in the gas industry during 1909 and 1904: -Oil was the most important material used, both in 1909 and in 1904, contributing 371 per cent of the total cost of materials for the industry in the later year and -504 per cent in the earlier Although the quantity used in 1909 was practically onethird more than in 1904, the cost was but slightly greater The material next in importance was coal, the cost of which represented 287 per cent of the cost of all materials in 1909 and 36 per cent in 1904 The quantity used increased 116,208 tons, or 10 per cent, and its cost $371,174, or 94 per cent, during the fiveyear period Although contributing a very small 1n∑oportion of the total cost of materials, calcium carbide, which is used in the manufacture of acetylene gas, shows the greatest relative gain in quantity, and also, with the exception of gas purchased, in cost A number of companies manufacturing gas within the state purchase considerable quantities of gas for distribution from other New York gas companies, _such purchases !Lmounting in 1909 to 6,289,180,000 cubic feet and costing $2,965,563 These :figures, in a measure, represent the extent of duplication in the industry for the year The decrease in cost shown for \"All other materials\" is due fargely to the fact that il1 1904 this class included lamps and appliances; which were reported separately in 1909 -Pig iron and ferro alloys (spiegeleisen, ferroma11ganese, etc), constituted the most important group of materials used in 1909 and 1904, as regards both tho tonnage ancl cost, but a slightly larger cost was reported for scrap iron in 1899 The cost of pig iron and the other materials included in this group formed -583 per cent of the total cost of materials used in 1909, as compared with 513 per cent in 1904 and 292 per cent in 1899 From 1904 to 1909 there was a general increase in the tonnage of each of the tlllee main groups of materials used, as well as in∑ the cost of each class of materials shown i11 the table, the largest relative gains in both respects being show f -Iron and steel, blast furnacesThe following table shows the quantity and value of pig iron produced i11 the years 1909, 1904, and 1899, together with the value of the other products of the blast:furnace industry in those years: -f:r sale The leading grade of pig iron manufactured during each of the t~ee census years was that for foundry purposes, wlnch formed 367 per cent of the total production in 1909, 451 per cent in 1904, and 873 per cent in 189_9 No Bess~m~r pig iron was reported in 1899, but 1t was second 111 unportance both in 1909 and in 1904, the output amounting to 622,115 tons in 1909, as compared with 225,414 tons in 1904 There were 19 active furnaces in 1909, of which 17 were located in the western part of the state, in Erie, Niagara, and Monroe Counties, and 2 in the Champlain district The western group of furnaces used Lake Superior ores, while those of the Champlain district used ores mined in the neighborhood Four furnaces of the Lackawanna Steel Company having a daily capacity of 600 tons each are included in the western group This is the largest size of furnace in use, there being only five others in the United States having this capacity -ChemicalsThe following table shows the quantity and value of the more important chemicals and groups of chemicals manufactured during 1909, 1904, and -per cent, from 1904 to 1909 The value of these products constituted 365 per cent of the total value of all products reported for the industry in the state in 1909, as compared with 208 per cent in 1904, and 69 per cent in 1899 The rem0,rkable growth in the manufacture of this group of products in New York is clue largely to t11e extensive utilization of water power in the western part of the state for the generation of electric current fhe value of this group of products manufactured in New York during 1909 represented nearly threefourths of the total value of such products for the United States The principal substances constituting this group in 1909 were aluminum (which is obtained exclusively by the electrolytic process), calcium carbide, hypochlorites, caustic soda, sodium, chlorates, phosphorus, and carborundum -The most decided relative increase from 1904 to 1909 was in the value of plastics The manufacture of plastics in New York is a comparatively new industry, for the total output in 1904 was valued at only $2,636, whereas in 1909 it reached $556,005, of which the valueof casein, fibrin, or gluten compositions represented 953 per cent Chloroform also shows large relative gains in quantity and value -In addition to those shown in the above table, chemicals valued at $1,835,321 were produced incidentally during 1909 by 17 establishments primarily engaged in the manufacture of products classified under other industry designations -products for the industry in 1909, 713 per cent in 1904, and 804 per cent in 1899 By far the greater part of the pianos were uprights without player attachments, this class showing a substantial increase both in number and in value for both :fiveyear periods The ∑growth in the production of pianos for or with player attachments, however, has been remarkable, the number having increased from 83 in 1899 to 1,506 in Hl04 and 18,917 in 1909 Comparatively few organs were made in the state during any one of the three census years The number dropped from 1,774 in 1899 to 58 in 1904, but advanced to 275 during the next fiveyear period Of these instruments, all in 1904 and nearly all in 1909 were pipe organs There were 1,701 reed organs manufactured in 1899, but none were reported in 1904 and only 30 in 1909 Both in 1904 and 1909 the value of parts and materials constituted a considerable proportion of the total value of products The major portion of this amount represents the value of the output of independent establishments manufacturing cases and other parts of instruments which were 11Sed as materials in the instrument factories of the state, so that their value was counted again as a part of the value of the finished pianos and organs and thus represents a duplication in the total cost of materials and value of products for the industry -Automobiles, including bodies and partsThe next table shows the number and value of the different classes of machines manufactured during 1909 and 1904 -ï Includes 5 steam touring cars The products included under the head of \"All other products\" at the census of 1909, the value of which amounted to $13,469,945, or 435 per cent of the total for all products, consisted largely of automobile bodies and parts manufactured by establishments where no finished vehicles were produced It has been the practice to segregate the manufacture of the different parts to a considerable extent and to distribute the various processes among different establishments As these partly manufactured products became the materials for other establishments which assemble the parts and produce the complete vehicle, there was a duplication, approximately equivalent to !he value of such bodies and parts used in the factor10s of the state in the total cost of materials and value of prod∑ ucts reported  for the industry -A larger value was reported for oleoresinous var, nishes at each of the three censuses than for any other single product presented in the table, though in 1909 the combined value of white lead dry and white lead in oil was slightly greater The value of this clas,s of varrnshes was considerably less in 1909, however, than in 1899, a decrease of 106 per cent between 1899 and 1904 having been only partly made up by an increase -(37 per cent) between 1904 and 1909 The quantity and value of white lead, both dry and in oil, manufactured in New York in 1909 formed 22,6 per cent and 23 per cent, respectively, of the corresponding totals for this product in the United States Other leading products, in the order of their importance in 19_09 as measured by value, were paints in oil, already mix:ed for use, the pigments classified as dry colors, and paints in oil in paste Of these five leading products, all except dry colors show a gain from 1904 to 1909 in value of output, and all except the paints in oil show an increase in quantity The largest absolute increase in value from 1904 to 1909 was that of $753,273, or 206 per cent, in the value of white lead dry and in oil combined, while the most striking increase in quantity was ~hat of 19,9511,910 pounds, or -809 per cent, in the output of dry colors The most pronounced relative increase in quantity was reported for barytes, and in value, for pyroxylin varnishes In addition to the various products reported in the preceding table for 1909, paint and varnish to the value of $806,814 were manufactured as secondary products by 15 establishments included under other classifications These products consisted mainly of bleached shellac, drying japans and dryers, and paints in oil, ready for use There were also 43,431,580 pounds of dry white lead, 737,214 gallons of varnish, and 170,249 pounds of lead oxide manufactured and used in further processes of manufacture within the paint and varnish establishments reporting -Leather, tanned, curried, and finishedThe quantity and cost of the different kinds of materials used in this industry during the last three census years are shown in the following table: -∑and kip skins) constit,uted a larger proportion of the total value of all products for the industry at the censuses of 1904 and 1899 than that of any other product, but by 1909 sole leather had taken the lead in this respect For the fiveyear period 19041909, tanned and :finished calf and kip skins show the largest relative increase both in number and in value876 per cent and 1273 per cent, respectively During the same period both the number and the value of the tanned and fmished goatskins a11cl sheepskins decreased In 1909 New York contributed 176 per cent of the total number of tanned and finished sheepskins, and 111 per cent of tho tanned and :finished calf and kip skins reported for the United States In addition to that shown in the above table, leather valued at $2,357,587 was tanned ∑and curried during 1909 by establishments which used it in further manufacture -The statement which follows gives the quantity and estimated value of the products tanned, curried, or -finished by theleathermanufacturing establishmen of the state durmg the years 1909 and 1904 f th ts -The number of hides tanned for others, exclusive of tanners, curriers, and :finishers, in 1909 was less than threefourths the number so treated in 1904, and the number of skins less than onehalf the number in 1904 The number of sides, splits, and skins curried or :finished, however, increased -SoapThe quantity and cost of the principal materials used in the manufacture of soap during 1909 and 1904 are shown in the following table: -414 per cent, in cost This class of materials represented 374 per cent of the cost of all materials used in 1909 and 491 per cent in 1904 With the excep∑ tion of caustic soda each of the remaining items shows an increase for th; fiveyear period in both quantity and cost The largest actual increase in cost reported for any class of materials was that of $3,038,722 for the items included under the head of \"All other \\x0cMANUFACTURESNEW YORK -terials\" Cottonseed oil and foots made the most maonounced relative gains in both quantity and cost, -the increase in eac 1 case amounting to more t an 10 per cent in quantity and to more than 200 per cent in value  -The following table gives the quantity and value of hard and soft soap and of glycerin reported for the last two census years, together with the value of the other -Canning and preservingIt was not until about 1850 that canning and preserving, as a factory industry, assumed commercial prominence New York was one of the first states in which it was developed, and the growth of the industry in that state has been remarkable Or the 790 establishments reported in 1909, 674 were engaged priniarily in canning and pre,serving fruits and vegetables; 101 :in the manufacture ,of pickles, preserves, and sauces; and 15 in cann:ing and curing fish -ïconsists of 24 standardsize cansNo 2 (also called 2pound cans) for beans, corn, peas, berries, cherries, and plums, and No 3 (also called 3pound cans) for all _other fruits and vegetables Where the output of fnnts and vegetables has been ropolted in other forms by the canneries, the quantities so reported have been reduced to standard cases in the table -ï Excluding statistics for one establishment, to avoid disclosure of lndivlduo1 operations With the exception of canned vegetables, each of the main groups of products shows a substantial gain from 1904 to 1909 both in quantity and in value -755 per cent of the total output of this product for the United States and 753 per 9ent of its value The quantity of smoked fish decreased∑ during the -Agricultural implements,Although the fiftieth industry in the state when measured by value of products, this industry is of considerable interest owing to the importance of agriculture in New York The following table gives the value of the different general groups of implements manufactured during 1909, 1904, and 1899: -Although the number of pairs of gloves, mittens, and gauntlets manufactured decreased slightly from ∑ -The following table gives, for 1909, a more detailed classification, showing for each class the total value of the output and tho number of pairs made from the different kinds of leather: -Of the total output of leather gloves, mittens, and gauntlets in 1909, 761 per cent were manufactured from lambskin or sheepskin, 36 per cent from kid, and 20 2per cent from other kinds of leather Of the dress gl~ves about 80 per cent were lambskin or sheepskin, and about 5 per cent were kid, while of the working gloves, mittens, and gauntlets nearly twothirds w~re sheepskin or lambskin, less than 1 per cent were kid, and the remainder were made of other kinds of leather -Carriages and wagons and materialsThe number and value of the different kinds of horsedrawn vehicles manufactured during the census years 1909, 1904, and 1899 are shown in the following table: -∑ In view of the extraordinary development of the automobile industry, particularly during the last five years, it is but natural that the output of horsedrawn vehicles should decrease materially In 1899, 96,107 such conveyances were manufact;1red in New York by the carriage and wagon establishments reported, but ∑ the number had decreased to 82,303 in 1904, and to 58,453 in 1909 The value of the vehicles made, however, increased 1 per cent from 1899 to 1904, although from 1904 to 1909 it decreased 283 per cent During the fiveyear period 19041909 the only kinds of vehicles showing an increase in number were business wagons and government and municipal wagons, while the largest decrease was in the number of family and pleasure carriages The number of sleighs

When anchoring a word to a topic, CorEx is trying to maximize the mutual information between that word and the anchored topic. So, anchoring provides a way to guide the topic model towards specific subsets of words that the user would like to explore.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The anchoring mechanism is flexible, and so there are many possibilities of anchoring. We explored the following types of anchoring in our TACL paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Anchoring a single set of words to a single topic. This can help promote a topic that did not naturally emerge when running an unsupervised instance of the CorEx topic model. For example, one might anchor words like \"snow,\" \"cold,\" and \"avalanche\" to a topic if one suspects there should be a snow avalanche topic within a set of disaster relief articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Anchoring single sets of words to multiple topics. This can help find different aspects of a topic that may be discussed in several different contexts. For example, one might anchor \"protest\" to three topics and \"riot\" to three other topics to understand different framings that arise from tweets about political protests.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Anchoring different sets of words to multiple topics. This can help enforce topic separability if there appear to be chimera topics. For example, one might anchor \"mountain,\" \"Bernese,\" and \"dog\" to one topic and \"mountain,\" \"rocky,\" and \"colorado\" to another topic to help separate topics that merge discussion of Bernese Mountain Dogs and the Rocky Mountains.\n",
