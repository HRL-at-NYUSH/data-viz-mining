The recent letter "The Third Labor Factor." by E.L. Stephens, in THE NEW YORK TIMES interests me as a nonunion worker and a firm believer in self-determination of minorities and majorities. But it fascinates me as an exercise in illogic.
No man of this generation has been a more energetic worker for world peace or a more disinterested friend of humanity than John Boyd Orr, who has received the Nobel Peace Prize for 1949.

The march of medicine and the high standards of living have greatly increased the life span of the American people.

The best measure of the average man's well-being in any country is how much work he has to do to get the things he needs and wants. Work and goods are the realities of which money is merely a symbol. In an article published in another section of this newspaper today Will Lissner employs this principle to make a comparison between conditions in the United States and in Russia since the devaluation of the ruble.
As a result of its drive last spring to persuade industry and business to employ older persons, the Federation Employment Service, 67 West Forty-seventh Street, New York 19, has issued a report with recommendations designed to attack the problem on a long-range and large-scale basis.
If the nation's 500,000 steel workers wish to strike, that is their right, and no one can justifiably raise a finger against their doing so.

BRINGING the universities and the workers of England closer together has been the big task of the Workers' Educational Association, founded in 1903 by Al  bert Mansbridge and other Englishmen interested in the movement of labor toward the best education the country can offer.
THOMAS A. EDISON, a grand young workingman, says he is glad at 73 years that the eight-hour day was not invented when he began work, and that no agitator ever convinced him that it was unfair to his fellow-workers to do the best he could for himself and those who paid him for his work.

From time to time the Russians observe cynically that the sole purpose of the Marshall Plan is to furnish a dumping-ground for surplus American products. The genesis and the administration of the Marshall Plan give the lie to these Russian statements. But the debate on the new foreign aid appropriation bill makes it clear that there are at least some members of Congress who would like to validate the Russian point of view.

Agriculture, in the opinion of many, is considered to be a form of industry more laborious and less attractive to natural man than hunting or herding, and that it is consequently only undertaken under constraint, this being generally due to pressure of population on available means of subsistence.

It is usually assumed that modern science, which produced long-range artillery and the bursting bomb, flamethrowers and poison gas, tanks and, above all, the airplane, has made war more horrible than it was in the past.

Up-State is virtuous. Down-State is wicked. Wall Street is the capital of the forces of evil. These things have been said so many times that believers in them are a multitude.

Second thoughts on voluntary code-making by American industry do not reveal a very clear-cut situation. The wage-hour-price structure under the NRA codes is unconstitutional. It is presumed that wages and working hours can be embodied in voluntary codes; but where is the line of demarcation when it comes to voluntary stabilization of prices when the anti-trust laws are considered?

The $656,000,000 tax bill that the Administration has introduced in the House should receive full support as a token of the nation's willingness to bear an increased burden for defense. But it would be a serious mistake to consider this tax bill as a solution of the real fiscal problem involved.

"The Purple Highway," the feature this week at the Rialto, was adapted from the whimsical play "Dear Me." Hery Kolker, the director of the film, has saturated his work with fantastic motion picture ideas and eliminated everything that appealed in the stage play.One leaves the theatre Just after having seen April, who has scored a marvelous success as a singer, running in her black velvet skirt and white bodice—which looked very well on the stage—to watch the man she loves, who has just left his yacht. He believes" that his affection is unrequited, as he had seen her in another man's arms.To catch the vessel they quickly engage a motor launch, which overtakes the other craft, and while still cutting through the water the orchestra leader and April (Madge Kennedy) clamber up the gangway, and in a cabin that might be aboard the Leviathan April tells Edgar Prentice that she loves him. It is all so silly after what one hoped for in the adaptation of the play, and also utterly unexpected, even though the producers saw fit to change the title.In another sequence Kolker again indulges his fancy. Dudley Quail is infatuated with April, which is perfectly obvious to all those who see the photoplay, but in order to impress upon her the extent of his love Dudley, who is foolishly wealthy, gives a special party for the girl who was once a drudge in the home for aged artists. He has special fireworks blazing her name in the skies, a troupe of dancers, and then a squad of flying girls, one of whom swings on a rope from balcony to balcony with a jeweled headdress as a gift for the guest of the evening. No wonder April remarked that "it's wonderful—and all for me." It would have been wonderful to anybody. It was a party that only a motion picture director would have given.Monte Blue plays the part of Edgar Prentice, the young man whose father started the home for failures. Mr. Blue sits or stands gazing with a woebegone, forlorn expression at April, and one is relieved when he is off the screen. Most of the acting is extremely poor, and it is irritating to see pictured on the screen the obvious fact that a manager has taken the play written by Prentice and then read a title saying:"You mean our play has been accepted?"Everybody in the audience knows that the play has been accepted and everybody thinks that Prentice ought to have known this long before the title appears. There are a number of other instances where the acting is the old-fashioned type of picture ideas. Leaning on a mantlepiece under an oil painting of the older Prentice is frequently done, and all the players are carrying out the instructions of the director, as to where to stand, how to look, where to put their arms and to look lovesick, or their idea of such an expression.At the outset it seems as if the voice behind this picture was going to let the play run as it did on the stage. There is the landlady, an ogre to April, and there are the failures—musicians, writers, artists and so forth. But Mr. Kolker soon gets away from such simple ideas and bursts forth to show what the screen can do to a play. He shows it with a vengeance.Miss Kennedy appears as if she knew that this production was going to develop on the serial idea rather than a play in which careful characterization was necessary."The Purple Highway," the feature this week at the Rialto, was adapted from the whimsical play "Dear Me." Hery Kolker, the director of the film, has saturated his work with fantastic motion picture ideas and eliminated everything that appealed in the stage play.One leaves the theatre Just after having seen April, who has scored a marvelous success as a singer, running in her black velvet skirt and white bodice—which looked very well on the stage—to watch the man she loves, who has just left his yacht.

Dudley Quail is infatuated with April, which is perfectly obvious to all those who see the photoplay, but in order to impress upon her the extent of his love Dudley, who is foolishly wealthy, gives a special party for the girl who was once a drudge in the home for aged artists. He has special fireworks blazing her name in the skies, a troupe of dancers, and then a squad of flying girls, one of whom swings on a rope from balcony to balcony with a jeweled headdress as a gift for the guest of the evening. No wonder April remarked that "it's wonderful—and all for me." It would have been wonderful to anybody. It was a party that only a motion picture director would have given.Monte Blue plays the part of Edgar Prentice, the young man whose father started the home for failures. Mr. Blue sits or stands gazing with a woebegone, forlorn expression at April, and one is relieved when he is off the screen. Most of the acting is extremely poor, and it is irritating to see pictured on the screen the obvious fact that a manager has taken the play written by Prentice and then read a title saying:"You mean our play has been accepted?"Everybody in the audience knows that the play has been accepted and everybody thinks that Prentice ought to have known this long before the title appears. There are a number of other instances where the acting is the old-fashioned type of picture ideas. Leaning on a mantlepiece under an oil painting of the older Prentice is frequently done, and all the players are carrying out the instructions of the director, as to where to stand, how to look, where to put their arms and to look lovesick, or their idea of such an expression.At the outset it seems as if the voice behind this picture was going to let the play run as it did on the stage. There is the landlady, an ogre to April, and there are the failures—musicians, writers, artists and so forth. But Mr. Kolker soon gets away from such simple ideas and bursts forth to show what the screen can do to a play. He shows it with a vengeance.Miss Kennedy appears as if she knew that this production was going to develop on the serial idea rather than a play in which careful characterization was necessary.
The class of servants in apartment houses has so deteriorated and thefts have become so frequent that companies have had to change their estimates of risk involved in policies covering these classes of insurance.
I have read the "servant question" these last three Sundays with great interest, and, although I doubt much that my opinion will be found worth your notice I cannot resist from giving it.
It would be hard to find a more thorough American, a man who did more for Americanization or who illustrated better the best qualities of American character and public service, than FRANKLIN K. LANE, who happened to be born in Canada.
SOME months ago I discussed with a friend the old, old  problem of the girl without money and out of a job. "It's all very well for you to talk about girls being able to keep straight if they want to," said the friend, "but...
GETTING a white servant for a Chinese family is vastly different from getting a Chinese servant for a white family," said the employment agent. "It is a good deal harder.
ABOARD THE STEAMSHIP LEVIATHAN, Oct. 17 (AP). -- Queen Marie's last day at sea was a quiet and restful one in preparation for tomorrow's reception in New York. The royal apartments, however, were in a state of considerable confusion as the servants had the corridors piled high with 160 trunks, boxes and bags which must be unloaded at Quarantine early in the morning.
To the Editor of The New York Times: In your valuable paper of Jan. 6 we noticed, under the above heading, a more sensibly written article than usually appears upon this vexed question. As the "so-called question" is put in the form of an ever-present difficulty to those who employ servants, might they not try a very simple remedy, which we will suggest?

Whatever may be the defects or peculiarities of public life in the Sahara, it seems to be free from that insolence of elected persons which sometimes annoys the untitled citizens of the Great American Desert.
It should be remembered in the first place that servants are not superior to the rest of humanity, and that gratitude is a rare virtue and generally short lived. A servant -- or anybody else -- may feel grateful at the time of receiving a kindness, but you cannot expect him or her to go on feeling grateful forever, which is, I gather, what people generally expect.

AN INCIDENT in one of David Lloyd George's visits to Switzerland, while he was still Prime Minister of Great Britain, has become classic.

In proceedings for legal separation or a man and wife, now pending in one of the local courts, one of the allegations of the aggrieved husband, and altogether the strongest of those embodied in his affidavit, is that the wife insisted upon retaining a singing servant girl in the house and that her singing established conditions which were intolerable.

To the Editors of The New York Times: After all that has been said on the servant girl question, I suppose there is no excuse for reopening the subject unless one has something new to contribute. My letler is simply an appeal for information which some experienced TIMES reader will Perhaps be able to supply.
My living costs me nothing, and my books and papers cost me nothing, and I read every night But Wednesday, when my beau conies, and Thursdays and Sundays, when I go out. On the Sunday when I am home I read the papers almost all day, that is when my work is done in the evening.
I have read with interest the correspondence that has taken place in your columns upon the domestic problem, and would be glad if you will afford me space for a few remarks. I have been twenty years in service, twelve of which were spent in working my way from page to butler.

SHE had experienced the common agonies in grappling with the "servant question," and now that the family had finally moved from the metropolis to New Jersey these had multiplied, of course, many fold.

In the letter you were kind enough to publish the writer pleaded for the creation of a new profession -- that of civil servant to the State. This profession should, of course, run on parallel lines with the military and naval services, and be equally under the auspices of the Government.
From The Anglo-American Magazine. For a few weeks we went without servants. By and by Okomoto appeared against the horizon. He had cooked for several families -- he named them on his fingers. We took him in, and such another specimen of Oriental sin never set foot in kitchen. His impudence was sublime, but at last the Junior Partner asserted her independence and Okomoto disappeared.
To the Editor of The New York Times: I have read with a great deal of interest the symposium in to-day's TIMES on the application of the eight-hour rule to the question of domestic service. A great many people will certainly indorse the views of Miss Dodge and others as to the practicability of such a proposition as this in the present state of social development.
To the Editor of The New York Times: I read in your paper of April 2 the communication of "G.A.B." of Summit. In my opinion, "G.A.B." is talking through her hat. Her comprehension must be very limited, when she asserts that it seems incredible to her to find a grammatically accomplished girl at housework.
To the Editor of The New York Times: We hear and know of many plans, well-contrived and executed for the benefit of workingmen and women, boys and girls, for their relief, comfort, or amusement, and it is conceded by all that such work is good.
According to a recent bulletin of the Census Bureau, the total number of employes in the civil service of the United States is 286,902. This is almost exactly five times the number of men in our so-called army, and about three times as many as in the army and navy combined.

IT is all very well, on the face of it, to get a cook from a private employment agency; but, for all the mistress knows, the cook may have  entered into a definite agreement with the agency to "get herself fired" within three weeks.
BEFORE another month is over there may be a sale of cooks.  Even now a cook may be had almost to your taste--if you'll shop around for her. Shopping for her, by the way, is better the first of the week. "They get sort of picked over by Friday," aplogizes an employment agent.
The pleading of Secretary BONAPARTE for higher salaries in the higher Federal posts is a sound one, though it does not follow, nor does he argue, that the salaries would have to be as high as those paid in private life, or as great as the incomes to be obtained in the professions by such men as Mr. ROOT or himself.
This current week has witnessed the introduction in the Canadian Parliament of a project of law such as we need this side the border, judging from recent incidents in Chicago, New York, and elsewhere. The Canadian idea is that strikes in all public utilities, such as street railways, coal mines, railways, and steamship lines, should be illegal.
It is a significant fact that though there are, according to the last census, considerably over 200,000 domestic servants in the metropolitan area, there is not in the whole of the elaborate and costly system of educational training which the London County Council has under its control a single school or even class for training young girls for service.

Our domestics are not very troublesome to provide for. They need neither bed nor blanket, but roll themselves up in a rug and sleep where they feel "so disposed" -- on the kitchen floor cometimes. Wages are infinitesimal. A cook, who is also laundress, gets 12s. a month, a housemaid 6s., and a boy to look after the mules and do odd jogs, 16s.

Let those who lament the house servant's hard fate hark to a householder's lament, which is submitted as a wall exceeding in sadness any sounds from the other side. I have been married seven years and have not yet been able to afford more than one servant -- sometimes not even that. I've had Germans, Irish, Finns, Africans, French, Norwegians, and a few more.
The salary of a City Magistrate in this borough is $7,000. A man with the ability to earn $7,000 in any private calling would in general serve the city most acceptably in the office of City Magistrate. It is not so much profound learning in the law and long experience at the bar that are demanded for the performance of the duties of City Magistrate as good judgment and sound common sense.

Of course, in this city of cheap house rents, you would suppose that housekeeping would be a pleasant and easy matter, as help gets only an average of $10 a month.

Indian housekeep  ing is at once very simple and paradoxically complex.

IT is now some years since I first heard that you New Yorkers had what you call a "servant problem.''

Controller Delano repts on all active banks in U S and its possessions as of June 30
They've made a pleasant screen comedy out of material taken from Booth Tarkington play, "Clarence." It is at the Rivoli this week.As might be expected, the picture is not as good as the original play was, and, be it hoped, still is, which is due, in large part, to the fact that the play needs the speaking stage. Inevitably much of it is lost in the process of adapting it to the silent, pictorial screen. At best, the cinema can be only a substitute.But it's a good substitute. William de Mille, the director, and Clara Beranger, the scenarist, have been faithful to the Tarkington spirit—except for occasional lapses into the heavy moralizing from which the movies seem incapable of escaping altogether—and they seem to have put as much as possible of the story into moving pictures that mean something. Also, the cast gives a good account of itself.In the rôle of Clarence, the returned soldier, who, innocently looking for a job, finds himself on the domestic battleground of the perpetually agitated Wheeler family, Wallace Reid qualifies beyond expectations. He fits into the part of the meek, yet exceedingly competent, Clarence with apparent ease and is able in several places to indulge in the light comedy pantomime at which he is adept. And May McAvoy, the long missing and keenly missed Miss McAvoy, who for some strange reason has not been provided with a picture and a part worthy of her remarkable talent since "Sentimental Tommy," at last has a chance to do a little of the acting of which she is capable. She is seen as the romantic daughter of the Wheeler family whose headlong attachments are one of the causes of its agitation. Agnes Ayres, as the governess whom Clarence takes away with him when he leaves the family to go back to his bugs, is something more than satisfactory, and Kathlyn Williams, as the dissatified wife, is, as usual, definitely expressive. Although Robert Agnew is not another Glenn Hunter he is amusing and clear as the ebullient son of the household who kisses the maid and wants to marry the governess, and Edward Martindel does well as the distracted father. The rest of the cast is sufficient.So, you see, this charming story of the professor of entomology who was a mule driver during the war and, without designs on his part, the peacemaker in a disordered family before returning to his college chair, retains not a little of its charm on the screen and doubtless will be found especially entertaining by those who did not see the stage play and do not know, therefore, how much they are missing.Also at the Rivoli is an attractively colored and genuinely sentimental picture called "Moonlight Sonata," which tells the story of Beethoven's visit to the cottage of a blind girl and of his improvization there of the composition after which the picture is named. It is an affecting little film.Another number is "Man vs. Beast," a pictorial record of the expedition into East Africa led by the late Louis Shuman. There are a number of striking views of the African landscape and the manners and habits of the natives are interestingly presented. There are also some exciting hunting pictures, though the shooting and death struggles of animals do not come under the head of "sport" and "entertainment" in every one's vocabulary, surely.One of those diverting and ingenious Funny Face doll comedies, called "Soldiers of Fortune," brings the bill to a close.They've made a pleasant screen comedy out of material taken from Booth Tarkington play, "Clarence."

WASHINGTON, D.C., March 28. -- Pleasant weather, a fair card, and the promise of good sport attracted a good-sized crowd to-day to the races of the Washington Jockey Club at Benning. A stiff breeze for twenty-four hours had so far dried out the track that it was dusty, although it was not fast.

Racegoers at the Gravesend track yesterday awoke rather suddenly to the fact that the two-year-olds of James R.

Horses from the West were first in three of six races at the Sheepshead Bay course yesterday, two of the victories being in stake events.

ALBANY, Jan. 25.--One hears a great deal of criticism, good, bad, and indifferent, about the new Capitol. Probably no other building, except the Capitol at Washington, has afforded so much food for talk since Government buildings began to be erected in this country. Admiration of the new Capitol, it must be admitted, is not expressed so loudly or by so many persons, as disapproval of it.
FORT SULLY, S.D., Dec. 27.--Reports of a massacre of settlers in this vicinity are unfounded. Squatters have been moving upon the reseravation in the lowlands along the Missouri, and the Cheyenne Sioux have made ugly threats, but the whites have not been molested. There are four computers of the Twelfth United States Infantry here, who are able to quell any outbreak in a few hours.

editorial lauds pending reformsIt seemed right and eminently proper that the charge of Mr. Geo. D. MORGAN, of this City, of $70,000 to the Government for a few months' occasional service in purchasing steamers, sail vessels, &c., and its allowance by his brother-in-law, the Secretary of the Navy, should not be suffered to pass without further notice by Congress. Accordingly, we have a report from Mr. HALE, of the Senate Naval Committee, strongly condemnatory of the whole transaction, and insisting that the $70,000, unjustly taken by Mr. MORGAN, should be restored to the public Treasury, and a fair compensation or salary allowed to him as the agent of the Department, instead. It may be that Mr. MORGAN is beyond the reach of this persuasion to the right. Indeed, if, as we have heard intimated, he has already declined an opportunity to restore the money, afforded him by the Chairman or some member of the House Committee of Investigation before the publication of their report, we deem it quite probable that he will not surrender his more than questionable gains, now that all the facts, in their naked deformity, have been made public. Be this as it may, the question cannot be surrendered, in silence, as one of private conscience with Mr. MORGAN himself. He has deemed it proper to come before the public in a labored defence of the head of the Navy Department, who threw this $70,000 in his way, and incidentally, in his own justification, for clutching it. The shallow reasoning of his letter might pass for the little that it is intrinsically worth, but for the circumstance of the country and family relationship which surround the whole transaction, and the indignity to the common intelligence of the public, and especially of a commercial public like that of New-York, by the use of such logic.
--A wild child is roaming through the forests of Iowa, and exciting much discussion among the primitive naturalists of that section of the country. The nearest approach that has been made to its capture was to find the place where it had slept, and the remains of a frog, whereon it had supped. This latter fact seems very clearly to indicate a French parentage for the young Orson. He probably resembles a canard.  -- A wild child is roaming through the forests of Iowa, and exciting much discussion among the primitive naturalists of that section of the country.

Victorian aristocrats fall for poor people. Small, over-roasted Hollywood peanuts.One of the most intriguing characters in the English fiction of our times is Irene, the beautiful charmer who casts her magnetic spell over most of the masculine element in John Galsworthy's Forsyte tales. Irene is that luscious creature whom the men inevitably adore and the women regard with such suspicion as festers in envy and despair. So naturally every actress of lofty station in Hollywood has yearned for the role of Irene. Greer Garson has got her, at last.And, to be quite blunt about it, Miss Garson and M-G-M have done just about as cruelly by her as anyone could possibly do. For what they have done to the poor lady in "That Forsyte Woman," now on the Music Hall's screen, is make a production out of her and let the real lady go hang. They have dressed her in ultra-gorgeous costumes, posed her in plush Victorian sets and filmed her in lavish Technicolor, probably the most lavish you have ever seen. They have marched pompous gentlemen up to her and had them profess their ardent love. And then they have gracefully retired her into the snugness of a cut-and-dried romance.The fault is not wholly Miss Garson's. She puts on the glamour act, yes, but the script is a lot of lifeless rhetoric and the direction by Compton Bennett is absurd. Take, for instance, one scene in a horsecab being drawn through the dark London streets with Irene and Young Jolyon Forsyte in it, engaged in a serious, heartfelt talk. This scene, which is basic to the forming of a major decision by Irene, should be subtly performed and lighted for the somberness of place and mood. That is as evident a moment for genuine staging as there is in the film. And yet Mr. Bennett has planted Miss Garson and Walter Pidgeon (as Young Jolyon) right in the middle of the cab seat and has lighted them in dazzling radiance. With his camera at a medium-close shot, he has then photographed the scene, with the two jawing stiffly at each other like a couple of dummies on a ventriloquist's lap. That is but one indication of the artificiality of this film.There are others, such as a lushly painted backdrop to represent the English countryside and a half dozen wooden performances by over-dressed members of the cast. Mr. Pidgeon, who plays Irene's salvation, is perhaps the least depressing of the lot, mainly because he has little to do until he steps in toward the end. But Errol Flynn as the lady's lofty husband—that "man of property," Soames Forsyte — is laughably rigid and pontifical and Robert Young as the suitor, Bosinney, is just plain dull.
A Los Angles Newsman Finds a Woman's missing sister.As a company which has had its cameras probe into various rackets heretofore, Universal-International does not surprise us, now that it is investigating the black market in babies in "Abandoned Woman," which arrived at the Criterion yesterday. But despite the advertisements, the newcomer is far from being "the year's most sensational picture." Sensational is hardly the word, since it is, in the main, a briskly paced thriller that merely indicates an insidious evil and then proceeds along conventional melodramatic lines to the climactic smashing of a baby adoption ring.As such it is a routine cops-and-mobsters number. Director Joe Newman moves his cast quickly, if not with too much imagination, through authentic Los Angeles locales from the opening, when his distraught heroine goes to the police seeking her missing sister and her baby, through the ultimate clean-up of the gang. In between, the usual number of informers, villains, and cops strew and follow clues and a handsome reporter and a forthright district attorney are in the vanguard lending willing assists to the anxious lady.Gale Storm is natural and engaging as the harried young lady who manages to rescue her niece, if not her sister. However, Dennis O'Keefe, as the brash, fearless and charming newspaper man and her romantic partner, seems closer to fiction than fact. Jeff Chandler turns in a competent characterization as the D. A. as do Marjorie Rambeau, as the dowager leader of the ring preying on unwary unwed mothers; Will Kuluva, as her sadistic henchman; Raymond Burr, as a double-dealing private sleuth, and Meg Randall, as an expectant mother who helps expose the gang. To be redundant about it, however, the acting isn't sensational either.

Early suds.Life, as the song writers have already pointed out, is so mysterious that it may not be altogether safe to question the realism of the melancholy events described in "Mary Stevens, M. D.," which is at the Strand. Kay Francis, in the new film, is a woman physician who has a startling amount of trouble preserving a professional detachment toward the primitive emotions.When Dr. Andrews, her suppressed desire, marries the daughter of a political boss and reveals himself as an unhallowed rogue by performing operations on children while under the influence of whisky and also by getting mixed up in a political scandal, she continues to find it impossible to live without him. The result of several illicit rendezvous with the fellow is that Miss Stevens, now a great baby specialist, finds herself in an interesting condition and has to run off to Paris. On the boat coming back the baby dies of infantile paralysis. The good doctor is on the point of hurling herself out of a fashionable hotel when Dr. Andrews bursts in with the glad tidings that he has obtained a divorce and can now make an honest woman of her.This is as sad a story as the cinema has offered recently, and it is a disagreeable circumstance which makes it necessary to point out that it also is one of the shabbiest of the Hollywood contemplations of the medical profession.Although the story, written with proper sincerity, might have been an interesting study of the problems confronting a woman physician in her work, this fatuous exhibit does not come within miles of dramatic integrity. There are the customary operating-room scenes and, for humorous sidelights, there is the customary flip and caustic nurse.Both Kay Francis and Lyle Talbot (the latter as the vacillating Dr. Andrews) perform competently, and there is one brief and excellent bit of acting by Una O'Connor, the English actress, who appeared as the cockney wife in "Cavalcade."
After all these years Helen MacKellar has taken up screen acting. As the embittered drudge who dwells morbidly among her memories of operatic triumphs, she has a roomy and full-bodied part in "The Past of Mary Holmes," at the Seventh Avenue Roxy. For this is "The Goose Woman" of blessed memory, the eccentric old lady in her ramshackle farmhouse, drinking furiously to forget her lost fame, feverishly playing the old phonograph records of her great arias to remember it.In the current version the narrative looks suspiciously like all the other shoddily carpentered melodramas devoted to the triumph of the maternal instinct, and in fact it is not exactly an argument for the continued resurrection of these curios of the cinema. But "The Goose Woman" has a solid story to tell, and with the assistance of Miss MacKellar and a capable cast this film tells it solidly.Eric Linden as the boy has been shrewdly cast. He gives the part sincerity and the quality of helplessness and anguish that it needs. Jean Arthur is better than usual as the girl, and Richard Gallagher as a reporter helps keep the story this side of bathos.Songs and Humor.John Fogarty, an Irish tenor from the radio, and Roy Smeck, who can lure some surprising orchestral effects from a mandolin and banjo, are in the stage show. For humor there are a pair of bouncing clowns named the Monroe Brothers.Dave Schooler and his band, the Gae Foster Girls and various variety acts complete the stage program.After all these years Helen MacKellar has taken up screen acting.

Amoral woman's office climb. Well-done drama with not-so-credible ending."Baby Face," the picture which recently aroused the ire of Will Hays and also was responsible for the resignation of Darryl Zanuck as assistant to Jack Warner at the Warner Brothers' studios, is now on exhibition at the Strand. It is an unsavory subject, with incidents set forth in an inexpert fashion.Barbara Stanwyck acts Lily Powers, who becomes known as Baby Face. She is presumed to have good intentions, but they are discouraged by her father, who keeps a disreputable speakeasy. A cobbler named Cragg, presumed to be an omnivorous reader, tells Lily of her beauty and the power she might have over men. This inspires Lily to leave for New York, where through a flirtation she succeeds in finding employment.Hoping for promotion from her position, she uses her wiles on a department manager and subsequently attracts the attention of the cashier, a young man named Stevens, who is engaged to marry Ann Carter, daughter of the first vice president. Evidently there is not a decent man in this bank—not one who scorns to have an affair with this tarnished Lily. Carter himself becomes infatuated with her and one day he is shot and killed by Stevens, who ends his own life.It is a pretty state of affairs when the directors of the bank are faced with the scandal, but later they have more anxious moments, for Trenholm, who is made president of the institution, encounters Lily in Paris, where she has been sent to work in the bank's branch after her threat to sell her story to a newspaper. Trenholm becomes so smitten with Lily's beauty that he marries her.In the course of the closing episodes, Lily, who has a fortune in jewelry and $500,000 in cash, at first decides to leave for Paris again, although she knows that her husband needs the money to save himself from imprisonment. Once aboard the steamship, however, she suffers a change of heart and is supposed to do her one good deed of the story.
Woman convict plans escape from San Quentin.When a reformer and a dashing female bank bandit fall in love, their home life may be somewhat as illustrated in the lingering finale of "Ladies They Talk About," which was unreeled at the Capitol yesterday. After a torrid argument in which Nan, the gun-girl, accuses her beloved of frustrating a jail-break in which two of her pals were killed, she loses her temper, draws a gun from her handbag and shoots him. "I didn't mean to do that," Nan remarks a moment later as David Slade falls to the floor with a bullet in his shoulder. "Why, that's all right, Nan," responds her husband-to-be. "It's nothing."The story is certainly on the violent side of drama, but not all of its entertainment is as wild as that "romantic interlude." A good part of the action takes place in a women's reformatory where Nan is an inmate, that young woman having arrived behind bars with the assistance of her friend, the reformer. Torn between those difficult twin urges of love and duty, David decides to heed both, and he therefore enlivens Nan's dreary life in prison with love notes, visits and promises of a speedy parole.It is in the prison scenes that the film provides some interesting drama. "Ladies They Talk About" is effective when it is describing the behavior of the prisoners, the variety of their misdemeanors, their positions in the social whirl outside, their ingenuity in giving an intimate domestic touch to the prison, and their frequently picturesque way of exhibiting pride, jealousy, vanity and other untrammeled feminine emotions.Maude Eburne, Lillian Roth, Dorothy Burgess and a Negress whose name is listed as Mme. Sul-te-Wan give this part of the picture a diversity of mood and character. In the leading rôles Barbara Stanwyck and Preston Foster are capable, but the story does not permit them many believable moments.On the Stage.An abbreviated production of Ziegfeld's "Show Boat" is on the stage. Helen Morgan and Jules Bledsoe sing the Hammerstein-Kern songs in their dependable fashion, and yesterday's audiences applauded them heartily. The varied scenes of the play have been mounted with accuracy and color, but the production misses the humor that Edna May Oliver gave to its recent revival.Harland Dixon, Paul Keast and the Jubilee Singers, headed by Robert Raines and Evangeline Lawson, are features of the large cast.
Perry, A, hurt; woman killed when auto runs into path of L I R R train
Lone jury holdout in murder trial. Most rewarding, and viva Edna May! Pounce.Edna May Oliver gives a most amusing performance in the Mayfair picture, "Ladies of the Jury," in which she appears as Mrs. Livingston Baldwin Crane, a society woman, who for the first time sits as a juror. It happens to be a trial for murder, in which a young actress, named Mrs. Gordon, is accused of shooting her elderly husband.Eleven jurors have been accepted when Mrs. Crane is called to the stand. She has little or no idea about court procedure and is especially glad to observe that the judge is a friend. It is quite plain that a few more women on the jury like Mrs. Crane would drive the judge to distraction, for she insists in shaking his hand and on asking the names of the prosecutor and the counsel for the defendant. She is accompanied to court by her maid and chauffeur and once she takes her seat among the jurors she desires to know how long the trial will last, explaining that she wants to know whether her chauffeur should wait for her.When the witnesses are called, Mrs. Crane persists in asking questions, and a friend or no friend, the judge, now quite irate, instructs, her to stand when addressing the court. Her idea of interrogating those who testify is followed by other members of the jury, but the fun is even keener later when the body of twelve good women and men true go into a room to deliberate.The scenes of the discussion among the twelve persons contain heaps of good humor. When the first ballot is taken all are for conviction of the defendant except Mrs. Crane. The foreman waxes impatient with Mrs. Crane, for she, in his opinion, is delaying matters. Mrs. Crane, however, is more than a match for him and gradually she wins over one juror after another, until the foreman finds himself and a stalwart woman known as Miss Lily Pratt, the only, two who vote "guilty."Through a rather adroit twist, the foreman and Miss Pratt are forced to change their opinions and Mrs. Crane has every reason to believe that she as a member of the jury is mightier than the prosecutor or the lawyer for the unhappy defendant.Although this picture is infinitely superior to Miss Oliver's last film, "Fanny Foley Herself," she is a clever enough player to deserve even a better story. But this film has a number of really funny lines and creditable portrayals are given by those in the supporting cast, including Robert McWade, who impersonates the judge; Ken Murray, who figures as a juror with a gift of the gab, and Mayme Mixter, who wisecracks to her heart's content.

IT is difficult to write entertainingly on the subject of anti-suffrage. Apparently, wit, esprit, and epigram flow less readily in the vicinity of the endangered home and hearth, and the zest of the passage at arms, the keen enjoyment of the rapier-like thrust, is all to the ardent protagonist.

I would like to suggest to your correspondent, "One Done," that in Mr. Frederic Ladd's novel, "The Woman Pays" very possibly the author intended his story to convey that of the two who transgressed the moral law it was the woman who paid the penalty, and not so particularly the man, I do not see that the husband paid -- at least in the end.

Presumably when a woman writer disguises both her identity and her sex by using either a masculine pseudonym or one that may denote either gender, she is flattered when reviewers call her "Mr." She must desire her writing to be taken for a man's work. We have known a thoroughly competent reviewer to call Miss Violet Paget "Mr. Vernon Lee" or "Mr. Lee" a dozen times in the course of a review of moderate length.

Kansas is at it again, demanding more teachers from the East. The teachers Kansas wants are always of the feminine gender.

In these days of nature-faking anecdotes the following, which bears the stamp of truth, will be welcomed by all animal lovers.

This is an answer to the reader who signs herself Newport. I attribute the feminine gender without hesitation, as women are not apt to spare each other! Although Newport has read "The House of Mirth" and "hopes to forget it," it seems to have made it sufficient impression upon her to call forth such a torrent of ill-merited abuse.
BOSTON, Mass., Oct. 16. -- William N.

" A Knight for a Day," the musical piece offered last night at Wallack's Theatre, bears at least a strong and entirely proper family resemblance to the original "Mam'selle Sallie," seen last season at the Grand Opera House and the New York Theatre.

PARIS. THE French were right to put "la mode" in the feminine gender, in their eminently logical language, for she certainly is all woman; even when, as this season, she prides herself upon having turned practical and economical with a vengeance, she is subject to a few delightful inconsistencies that are not the least among the secrets of her charm.

A running catch by Seybold was the fielding feature. Score:
Despite our best efforts, the Fairbanks cocktail scandal grows, and threatens to damage the political aspirations of the Indiana statesman.

Erotic English "literature" is here further enriched by some account of the experiences and opinions of a creature, presumably of the masculine gender, who dresses himself in "the Soft lemon light" and admires himself in a mirror as he stands amid silver toilet articles and ivorywhite bowls filled with masses of gloire de Dijon roses.
To the Editor of The New-York Times: There can be no question that a considerable section of the opposition to the granting of the franchise to women rests neither on prejudice, selfishness, ignorance, fear of competition, pride of power, nor conceit, but on fear of the results to the people; in other words, upon distrust of popular self-government -- distrust of government of the people, by the people, for the people.

We view with wholesome awe the quick and formidable advance of woman suffrage. If the parade turns out to be as impressive as it now threatens to be, the anti-suffragists, male and female, will tremble in their boots and suede pumps.

Detroit did not hit Houck with any frequency until the eighth, but made the most of its drives.
NOT a friend in the world," is an epitaph that sums up completer failure in life than "Not worth a penny." Financial crash may sweep away accumulated wealth.

So you think that the 1945 pennant races are the closest and the most furious in baseball history.

Why should the French word employe be so much used when we have at hand the English form of the same word, which seems at once to suggest itself and answers every purpose?

Franklin was the American master of aphoristic wisdom. His precepts and maxims have been sometimes objected to as on a low plane of selfish thrift, and savoring rather of political economy than of the golden rule.

IT was really a very serious matter, though of course the Mere Man had laughed and pooh-poohed the suggestion that it would be. Had he not rubbed elbows with Fashion night after night at the opera?

JUST here and there in exclusive little shops, in smart restaurants, shaded by the hood of a handsome limousine, one sees suggestions of new styles.

About Mr. Lafcadio Hearn there is something of Bernardin Saint Pierre, with no little of the more modern Theophile Gautier and of the Pierre Loti of to-day. He has the love of the generalizer in nature as had Saint Pierre, the flow of language as of Gautier, and that power of assimilation which belongs to M. Loti.

-- A movement has been started in Philadelphia, nominally by the restaurant men, but acting, it is believed, at the instigation of the saloon keepers, to do away with free lunches in places where liquor is sold.

In the last debate in the Assembly the political situation was cleared of a large amount of rubbish, and the Government indicated its policy more clearly than it has hitherto done. M.

Messrs. Lucy STONE, ANTOINETTE L. BROWN, and Company, gave the public another touch of their quality, yesterday, at Metropolitan Hall.

Not satisfied with their own Conventions,
WHEN San Francisco comes into the news as a storm centre that fact is partly a sign of the times and partly an evidence that the city's temperament has not changed. From the days of the Vigilantes, clash and struggle have again and again rocked the peninsula beside the Golden Gate.
Mr. Harris's "Uncle Remus, His Songs and His Sayings," published in 1880, gave us a foretaste of that pleasant subject of folk-lore on the plantation, and in the present volume, having found new stories, derived from the same sources, the author has presented a delightful work.

BEAUTY such as Corinne Griffith's is bound to help almost any production, but one can't help sighing at times when beholding some of the scenes in the picturization of Zoe Atkins's play "Declasse," in spite of the lovely eyes of the star. Robert Vignola has handled this story with a heavy hand, obviously with the idea of catering to the unsophisticated audiences.
EQUINUNK, Penn., Jan. 17.--Men who celebrate their eightieth birthdays by persistent and eager hunting of wild cats are undoubtedly so rare in this or any other country that when one such is found it is worth while to make a note of the fact and put it on record.

Intellectual or learned women have for ages been a theme for satirists, who always portray them as tiresome, pedantic, and uninteresting. They intimate, if they do not directly declare, that it is unwomanly to have a good mind and to use it liberally.

Having just witnessed the closing exercises of our Fourth Annual State Fair, upon the daily eoutine of whose arrangements I was for several days an attendant, I have ventured to offer you some account of the proceedings.
FOUR years ago word went out that "Hoosier Jim" -- James Whitcomb Riley -- the Indiana singer of songs and writer of jingles, had written his last rhyme, that he was paralyzed and near the grave. It cast a pall of gloom over the Hoosier State, over all America, yes, over the hole world, for Jim Riley, former barefoot boy from Greenfield, is the friend of Kings and Emperors.
WHEN Mark Twain wrote his celebrated essay "Concerning the Jews," race feeling was not more than normally exacerbated. Thanks to the geniality of his humor, he was able to present a portrait of the most discussed of peoples which was as intimately characterized -- as free in the use of both light and shadow -- as it was broadly human, tolerant and wise.

HERE are some miscellaneous notes on the production of "The Tempest" at The Century, notes which might be read as a tentative preface for the revival of a Shakespearean romance so infrequently played in the theatres of this country as to be virtually unknown to the American stage.

THE new reporter said he would like to interview an actress. He felt that he could get something interesting and -- the stage had always appealed to him. Whereupon the kindly and sympathetic editor, who is always ready to encourage and advise, sent him on the quest. She was a prominent actress who had appeared only a few nights before in an important play in which she scored an emphatic success.

THIS well-printed volume of 350 pages* aims at presenting and defining the language of Shakespeare "so far as it has passed from our modern speech," excluding "all words and senses of words which are still in good literary use," and, "except where there is obscurity, all senses which are merely contextual and do not represent an authenticated usage."
LAST week the Bulgarian delegates appeared before the allied com  mander in the Balkans and signed an armistice. The terms, in general, were unconditional surrender. The specific terms were those laid down as vital in last week's article--they were the only terms the Allies could accept, the only terms they can accept from any of their enemies.

SOME day a history of the movies will have to be written (and this may be its outline) in which there will be no mention of Thomas Edison, Samuel Goldwyn or Will H.

The great importance of this subject, and the deep interest now being manifested by all and the deep interest now being manifested by all conversant with such matters, will be deemed a sufficient apology for encroaching upon your columns.

IN irritable but anonymous "playgoer" complains, in one of those letters a newspaper writer on theatrical topics is always receiving from folks who want to correct his errors and teach him something, that no American actress when she plays an old woman's part is ever willing to "make-up" to look old and ugly.
SINCE Lewis Waller made his announcement that he intended to be an American producer of plays -- for the time being, at least -- he has been busy getting his plans in order and experiencing the difficulties and the comparative pleasures that follow the ways of the producer in this country.
There are some moderately interesting sequences in the picturization of Edna Ferber's story, "Gigolo," but this vehicle has not been handled with a full appreciation of its dramatic possibilities. The dearth of suspense in many of the chapters results in the situations being flashed on and off the screen in a rather lukewarm fashion. While the acting of Rod La, Rocque, Louise Dresser and Cyril Chadwick is praiseworthy, it is quite obvious that their performances would have benefited considerably by more imaginative direction.The first introduction of the "Gigolo," an insufferable Paris specimen who dances for money, is a little abrupt. One understands all about him, but he wanders away for several chapters, and then reappears as a pivotal point of the photoplay.In many instances this film is not outstandingly convincing. Money plays an important part in this subject, but it seems to come and go according to the director's whim. First one perceives Julia Gory, a widow who marries Dr. Gerald Blagden, returning to Pleasanton, Wis., after a stay abroad. She is by no means enthusiastic regarding life in Pleasanton, and to please her second husband she sells out her interest in a steel foundry. Her son, Gideon, is quite happy in the little town, largely because he has fallen in love with Mary Hubbel. To please his mother he accompanies her abroad, and then comes the war. Gideon loses no time in enlisting in the French Air Force, while Dr. Blagden curses the war and appears to be slowly poisoning Julia.Julia spends all her money and has to live in a most humble street, for which the title writer has invented a new sort of French in which he scorns to recognize the genders. Gideon is injured and the right side of his face is treated by skillful surgeons. He looks quite strange and has to wear a monocle to stop his face from twitching.Subsequently Gideon returns to Paris where, after his mother dies, he is forced to earn his living. For a time he joins the ranks of the gigolos, or the breed with loose ankles, in order to get wine and good food.There is at least in this film one piece of comedy that created a sturdy outburst of laughter yesterday in the Hippodrome. It is where Mr. Hubbel takes his daughter to a Parisian restaurant and not being familiar with the French language he orders "three gigolos."There are some moderately interesting sequences in the picturization of Edna Ferber's story, "Gigolo," but this vehicle has not been handled with a full appreciation of its dramatic possibilities.

WALLACK'S THEATRE.--A new piece in this warm weather is a gift which we should receive from the gods with all humility and gratitude. And in good truth the new piece produced at Wallack's Theatre last evening would very well justify some thanks. "Lalla Rookh " is a decided success, despite the little inconvenances which marred the general effect at the first representation last evening, and which we hope to see amended.

How much the cause of Temperance has been advanced by the recent Convention of Men, Women and Bloomers, whose garrulity has so largely exhausted our space and the public patience for the past few days, we shall not presume to calculate. We think it unfortunate, however, for the respectability of any cause that it should fall into such hands, and be urged by such proceedings as those of the past week.
Although sea life lacks many of the social advantages which are to be had on shore, the sailor is as fond of the society of his own species as is the average landsman. The dearth of social advantages on shipboard forces Jack to devise ingenious substitutes for the lyceum, the playhouse, the assembly room, and other similar institutions.

Jewel thieves aboard the Orient Express. Enough with the railroading, even then.Ever since the days of "The Great Train Robbery," released in 1903, Hollywood has shown a fondness—one is tempted almost to say a suspicious fondness — for the melodrama that can be mounted on railroad tracks. A shot of clicking wheels, or of a train passing through a tunnel, conveys a sense of action, even when the story does not. That, however, is not entirely true of "I Am a Thief," the current item at the Mayfair, which is of the genre of "Silk Express," "Orient Express," "Shanghai Express" and a few other express stories. There is more than a suspicion that its present name was selected only after the discovery that the stock of "express" titles had run out.If it does little else, the Mayfair film confirms an idea that this corner stumbled upon many moons ago. The notion is that the moviemakers are convinced that the trains of Central Europe carry a few bona fide passengers but derive their chief revenue from the transport of international jewel thieves, their potential victims and secret police agents; that sinister men and women are always prowling through compartments and leering into the camera without any one ever noticing, and that the conductors never bother about tickets, but just poke about in the corridors, looking for murdered passengers.It is on just such a train that most of the action of "I Am a Thief" occurs. Here is suave Ricardo Cortez, with the famous Karenina diamonds, and Mary Astor, who seems to be after them, and Irving Pichel as one of the sinister lurkers-around, and Robert Barrat as another. Nor will the knowing spectator be duped by the apparent innocence of the obviously bogus Colonel Jackson (Dudley Digges), or the dithering antics of the timid lawyer as played by Ferdinand Gottschalk.As the train races from Paris to Istanbul to the tune of "button, button, who's got the button?"—the button being the "jools"—suspicion wheels from one to another, so that it's pretty hard, at times, to figure whether Mr. Cortez is as our neighbor put it, the good guy or the villain; and that goes for Miss Astor, with the appropriate change in gender. At the finish everything is explained to every one's satisfaction; but this corner—with all appreciation of the mystifying melodramatics of the film—ventures a timid plea to the film producers, ventures it as a possible New Year's resolution to Hollywood: Please, Sirs, won't you give up making any more "Shanghai-Orient-Silk-I-Am-A-Thief Expresses" in 1935? We're tired of railroading.

Skull Island again, with a surprising Junior. Good sequel. Best moment last: upraised paw.The Prince of the celebrated house of Kong is a vaudeville buffoon alongside of his old man, who played hob-nob with a squadron of pursuit planes on top of the Empire State Building last year. The explorers begin by rescuing the Prince from a quicksand bog. Thereafter this fellow, who is not an inch over thirty feet, follows the treasure hunters around the mysterious island, defeating crossword puzzle fauna by the methods once employed by Charlie Chaplin to evade pompous policemen and irate merchants. The big earthquake climax of "Son of Kong" is straight out of the "Partners in Peril" library. Engulfed by the rushing waters, Prince Kong gallantly holds Robert Armstrong above the flood until the boat with the other explorers comes along, and then collapses sacrificially into the sea.This sequel to last season's hair-raiser is a low melodrama with a number of laughs that are loud and satisfying, although the comical intent of the producers is open to argument. Kong's battles with two ruffians of questionable race and gender is full of the head-punching gusto of a wrestling match in the Garden. Young Kong is, perhaps, a more effective pantomimist than his late lamented sire. When a giant cave bear taps him gravely on the head he crosses his eyes lugubriously in the highly comical style of Ben Turpin.For all that, "Son of Kong" is not the masterpiece of mechanical ingenuity that "King Kong" was, To its leading player the film devotes a regrettably small portion of its story. The introduction is a long and windy account of Carl Denham's preparations for the trip and it goes to unnecessarily trying lengths to plant the villain and the girl. Helen Mack, the heroine, is spared the romantic terrors endured by Fay Wray in her meetings with the neurotic parent.Crowds reminiscent of the halcyon days besieged the Roxy for a look at "Son of Kong" yesterday Compounded chiefly of youngsters, they enjoyed themselves, if their pleasure was proportionate to the noise they made.On the Roxy Stage."Buck and Bubbles," a pair of comedians whose blackface doesn't wash off and whose patter is genuinely funny, are the best liked of the Roxy's new-stage features. Other mentionable members are Al Gordon's trained dogs, George Prentice's "Punch and Judy" show, the "Twelve Aristocrats," who dance smartly, and a Gae Foster ensemble dance, with the girls effectively costumed in long satin gowns and drooping hats. Paul Remos, whose midget act appears to be one of the few really changeless things on the variety stage, and Dave Schooler, who is fare-welling this week, complete the bill.
ONCE more the cry has been raised that the schoolmaster is invading politics. At present and at home his welcome is a distinctly derisive one. The academic point of view and the academic mind are not popular with the masses. Col Watterson's characterization of Gov. Woodrow Wilson as "a schoolmaster and not a statesman" was confessedly not meant to be flattering.
Frontier frills for maturing Deanna, and some nice Kern songs. Best: ``Any Moment Now.''Those Yuletide herald angels hit some vocal competition yesterday in the neighborhood of Loew's Criterion, where the caroling concession was in the hands of melodious Deanna Durbin in "Can't Help Singing," a Universal film. And, by all the holiday evidence, Miss Durbin's generosity with songs was none the less seasonal and triumphant than that of the seraphic choir. For songs in abundance and par excellence are the best things in this gaudy color film, and Miss Durbin sings them in a fashion which makes it thoroughly pleasing that she can't desist.As for the show itself, it happens to be an airy outdoor musical which might, just by chance, bear faint resemblance to "Oklahoma!" a modest Broadway hit. That is to say, the story is about a pre-Civil War debutante who goes west to California in pursuit of that westbound young man, only en route she meets up with another whom she likes much better and, thereafter, pursues. And what with the costumes and choruses and bumpkin comics wandering hither and yon, it does recollect—at least, in purpose—the bucolic charm of the forenamed hitIt must be remarked, however, that the book lacks the latter's subtle grace and, except for a few comic moments, is pretty much run of the operetta mine. Those moments come by virtue of the burlesque performances of Akim Tamiroff and Leonid Kinskey as a couple of Slavic fortune-hunters camp-following an overland wagon train. Bewildered by the "customs of the country," the boys are really pretty good.But the costumes and scenery are dazzling — in opulent color don't forget—and the songs, as we say, are fair reason for taking time off to see the show. Jerome Kern is the author of them, and they range from the lyrical title song to a rousing choral number called "Californ-i-ay." This latter (not dissimilar to "Okla-lahoma," one might observe) has a dandy lyric by E. Y. Harburg, which the Chamber of Commerce might endorse. "The hills have more splendor; the girls have more gender"—that's just one couplet we recall.And Miss Durbin is peaches-and-creamy as the little lady who does the cross-country jaunt and pauses (or keeps strolling) at suitable intervals, to warble her repertory of songs. Robert Paige, an outworn juvenile, is the incomprehensible gentleman of her choice and Ray Collins, Andrew Tombes and Olin Howlin are amusing in small comedy roles. You may count on "Can't Help Singing" as an hour and a half of diversion.
AFTER the fiercest battle fought in many a year on the floor of the House of Representatives at Washington, that body passed, by a vote of 153 to 31, the resolution adopting as the form of the famous $2,000,000 Lincoln Memorial the Greek Temple design of Henry Bacon, to be erected at the western end of the Mall and immediately on a line with the Capitol Building and the Washington Monument.
EVERY month since Nov. 11, 1918, when the armistice was signed, after the enemy's abject surrender, large bodies of  men have been released from military service, and have left the zone of the armies to be reabsorbed into civil life.
Early schoolmarm saga, still one of the best.These are bitter times, when looking backward is much more pleasant for a lot of people than looking ahead. And that is why a goodly number will probably find much comfort and delight in Richard Rowland's sentimental survey of a simple and homely life well-spent—a little picture called "Cheers for Miss Bishop," which opened yesterday at the Music Hall. For there is nothing about this Miss Bishop and the even and ordered world in which she lived to disturb or upset the thoughts of any one in this hectic day. In fact, there is little about her to disturb anything, save perhaps a random tear. "Cheers for Miss Bishop" is decidedly a lavendered and lace-adorned memorial to a sweet and tender way of life now spent.The story is taken from the novel by Bess Streeter Aldrich and prepared by a group of capable writers who might have done better with it. For actually they have made it nothing more than a sixty-year-long account of the career of a noble little lady who teaches at a Midwestern school. There are the usual and expected little crises—the meeting with her first class, that young and disappointing love, the adoption of her cousin's baby girl, a second and more sedate affair of heart, her eventual retirement from teaching and that final testimonial from all her pupils who have become great successes in life. But that's all. There is no excitement, no experience much more violent than that of sipping tea before a cozy fire in grandmother's sitting room on a Winter afternoon.Like "Good-bye, Mr. Chips," which it very suspiciously resembles in every way but one, "Cheers for Miss Bishop" makes much of nostalgic recollections and the gracefulness of growing old. But it often makes too much of them, and tends uncomfortably toward the quaint or laboriously cute. There is a slightly spurious ring to many of its little touches; antiquity is made a repeated joke. A gasoline buggy, after all, is not so tremendously funny. And there is nothing original about old age. People are growing old every day.But that is the one accomplishment with which every one connected with the making of the picture seems to have been most impressed. Martha Scott, who plays the title role, is charming as a young woman but very feeble when bowed down with years. William Gargan, as her life-long suitor who never gets beyond a forehead kiss, is the same: he bubbles and glows as a young fellow and behaves like a mausoleum as an old man. It goes for all the others, too, for practically every one in the film is a victim of gathering years and the make-up man's artistry. And Tay Garnett's slow and obvious direction has not helped any of them very much.True sentiment is a rare thing, and we wouldn't make light of it. But the sentiment in this picture is heavily overdone. Some one was saying that Miss Bishop is the feminine Mr. Chips. With all due respect to her gender, we definitely say she is not.
EVER since Adam said to the Lord in the Garden of Eden, "The woman thou gavest me tempted me, and I did eat," stupid and weak men have been trying to deflect mankind from their own sins by casting the malodor of them upon some too confiding women.
When the Giants and Athletics clash at the Polo Grounds on Saturday for the first game of the World Series two entirely different schools of baseball will opposed each other. Manager John J.

As a successor to "Der Raub der Mona Lisa" there is at the little Europa an ingenuous German-language film farce with tuneful music. It bears the title of "Liebeskommando" and has the distinct advantage of having been directed by Geza von Bolvary, who made both "Zwei Herzen im Dreivierteltakt" and "Der Raub der Mona Lisa."This time Herr von Bolvary's story is not nearly as subtle as the previous vehicles, but it succeeds in being mildly amusing. Like his Berlin colleagues, Herr von Bolvary is a master of detail and he has gone to great pains to enhance the value of this frivolous tale with compelling atmospheric effects.The plot recalls that of an old French play," Les Vingt-huit Jours de Clairette," for it tells of the adventures of Antonia while impersonating her brother as a student in the Austrian military academy. Apparently the only person in the secret is the commandant's daughter. There are several farcical incidents, during which the officers and the other students are called upon to be strangely myopic. Antonia succeeds in evading the scrutiny of the men, but toward the close of the proceedings Lieutenant von Lorenz, played by Gustav Froehlich, suspects the truth.The reason for Antonia masquerading as her brother is because they are descended from a long line of warriors, but the father because of being an invalid was prevented from being a soldier. He has lived so long in Italy that his German is faulty when it comes to genders in that language and this fact serves to arouse laughter when the old man discovers that his daughter and, not his son as he supposed, is at the military academy. It is because the son, who prefers to be a student of music instead of war, wins a prize for a composition that the father investigates matters.When Lieutenant von Lorenz realizes that the little person in uniform is a girl there are further farcical situations and likewise when the commandant one day observes a cadet entering his daughter's room.Dolly Haas gives a vivacious portrayal as Antonia. Herr Froehlich is competent in his rôle. Anton Pointner makes the most of the part of the commandant.Robert Stolz, composer of the melodies for "Zwei Herzen," "Das Lied ist Aus" and "Der Raub der Mona Lisa," is responsible for the agreeable musical airs in this film.Executors of the will of Mrs. Ceclia Belasco, wife of the late David Belasco, theatrical producer, filed with Surrogate John P. O'Brien yesterday an accounting of three trusts in her will, showing that the value of the residuary estate was $232,395 and that Mrs. Renia B. Gest, their daughter and wife of Morris Gest, producer, had received payments totaling $19,850 as life tenant of the residuary fund. The payments made to Mrs. Gest, who lives at 71 East Fifty-second Street, cover the period from Nov. 25, 1927, to May 14, 1931, the date of her father's death.Mrs. Belasco died on Dec. 22, 1926.The other funds accounted for provided for Mrs. Belasco's sister-in-law, Mrs. Carrie Loverich, and her niece, Mrs. Lottie L. Harris, both of Los Angeles. Mrs. Loverich, the report showed, had received $2,065 from her fund, worth $12,593 on May 14, 1931, and Mrs. Harris had received $1,235 from her trust, valued at $7,513.Six concerts have been arranged for the next two weeks to be presented in the hospitals of the city under the auspices of the music committee of the New York City Visiting Committee. Mrs. Richard Aldrich will be the sponsor of a concert at Seton Hospital today and Mrs. William C.

Antonia succeeds in evading the scrutiny of the men, but toward the close of the proceedings Lieutenant von Lorenz, played by Gustav Froehlich, suspects the truth.The reason for Antonia masquerading as her brother is because they are descended from a long line of warriors, but the father because of being an invalid was prevented from being a soldier. He has lived so long in Italy that his German is faulty when it comes to genders in that language and this fact serves to arouse laughter when the old man discovers that his daughter and, not his son as he supposed, is at the military academy. It is because the son, who prefers to be a student of music instead of war, wins a prize for a composition that the father investigates matters.When Lieutenant von Lorenz realizes that the little person in uniform is a girl there are further farcical situations and likewise when the commandant one day observes a cadet entering his daughter's room.Dolly Haas gives a vivacious portrayal as Antonia. Herr Froehlich is competent in his rôle. Anton Pointner makes the most of the part of the commandant.Robert Stolz, composer of the melodies for "Zwei Herzen," "Das Lied ist Aus" and "Der Raub der Mona Lisa," is responsible for the agreeable musical airs in this film.Executors of the will of Mrs. Ceclia Belasco, wife of the late David Belasco, theatrical producer, filed with Surrogate John P. O'Brien yesterday an accounting of three trusts in her will, showing that the value of the residuary estate was $232,395 and that Mrs. Renia B. Gest, their daughter and wife of Morris Gest, producer, had received payments totaling $19,850 as life tenant of the residuary fund. The payments made to Mrs. Gest, who lives at 71 East Fifty-second Street, cover the period from Nov. 25, 1927, to May 14, 1931, the date of her father's death.Mrs. Belasco died on Dec. 22, 1926.The other funds accounted for provided for Mrs. Belasco's sister-in-law, Mrs. Carrie Loverich, and her niece, Mrs. Lottie L. Harris, both of Los Angeles. Mrs. Loverich, the report showed, had received $2,065 from her fund, worth $12,593 on May 14, 1931, and Mrs. Harris had received $1,235 from her trust, valued at $7,513.Six concerts have been arranged for the next two weeks to be presented in the hospitals of the city under the auspices of the music committee of the New York City Visiting Committee. Mrs. Richard Aldrich will be the sponsor of a concert at Seton Hospital today and Mrs. William C. Rockefeller at City Hospital on Friday.Other concerts include one in memory of Anthony Schulte in the tuberculosis wards of Metropolitan Hospital on Monday, one at Randalls Island through Mrs. Alonzo Sexton next Wednesday, one at Coney Island Hospital through Mrs. Douglas Robinson on May 5 and one in the psychopathic and tuberculosis wards of Bellevue Hospital through Mrs. William C. Osborn on May 6.
A REQUEST for an anecdote," said Michael Morton, playwright, "reminds me of the story which they tell of a famous English comedian who was invited to dine at the house of some 'nouveaux riches.'

To the Editor of the New-York Daily Times: I have been induced on various occasions to visit Castle Garden with a view of ascertaining how far that establishment has answered the purpose for which it has been employed by the Commissioners of Emigration, and after a minute examination of matters in general, I feel it a duty imperatively incumbent on me to testify to the public the perfect
The fact that within the last day or two there have been anxious inquiries from Europe as to the new position Gen. BUTLER has assumed in reference to the finances and the payment of our debt, gives proof that upon one matter at least our public men and political parties will have to be careful as to what ground they take.
A House of Commons fresh from the hustings is easy of division, This is the time when it ought to be secured by the chief who expects to do anything; for every month, every affair of a night, every trifling incident, tends to obliterate pledges and to supply new motives or new pretences for action.

A Stage Ride through Missourj. NO. IV. WING'S STATION TO CALIFORNIA. At this point our Vermonter resolved to aba??don us. He had sold his seat from Booneville on to a fellow-passenger; and so lcontemptible an idea had he gained of our mode of conveyance, that he did not care to retain it even for the two miles remaining, over which he was still entitled to ride (occasionally.)
The politicians, during the past two or three weeks, have been extremely busy; nor is there likely to be a cessation of political excitement until after our municipal election in May. The People's Party have nominated two candidates for municipal offices. The first, Mr. BROWN, for the office of City Treasureran important and responsible position.
Notwithstanding the favorable weather, the attendance at the Creedmoor shooting was much smaller yesterday than on the preceding Saturday. Still, more than 300 soldiers put in an appearance, and practiced faithfully all day. High scores were the exception rather than the rule, both at the marksmen's and at the sharpshooters' ranges, owing to the strong breeze that blew all day in the wrong direction.

THERE'S no denying the fact that throughout a goodly part of the civilized world a strike of vast proportions is in progress -- the strike of a sex. For that is what the whole feminist movement, with its allied phenomena of dwindling birth rates, servant problems, ousekeeping difficulties, and disappearing home life, amounts to.

Mr. Sydney Rosenfeld has contributed to the American stage a new work which is serious in design and novel in substance. Mr. Rosenfeld, since he wrote "A Possible Case," has been looked upon by unprejudiced observers as a promising American dramatist. He has been an American dramatist, for that matter, for nearly twenty years, as he wrote things for the stage in his boyhood.
The annual Fail Parade of the First Division, on Monday last, was a success, and the National Guard of this City have reason to be proud of the fact.

Speeches of Brigham Young. John Young, Heher Kimball, ,  What the Mormons Threaten. We have received our files of the Descred News, to Nov. 4. The papers are filled with in flammatory speeches from BHIOHAM YOUNG, JOHN YOUNG, HEBER C/ KIMBALL, and other prominent Genders. We make extracts from some of the more spicy specimens of Mormon fulminations, tending to show the spirit that possesses the Saints:
A strange apparition flitted through Printing-house-square yesterday morning, a remnant of the masquerade carnival; a wonder to the unchins who have their habitat in the park and "blag your boots," or abuse you, if you refuse to have them blacked. "A part of the procession," says one. "Barnum's Arab," says another, "Ned Buntline," said the older ones to whom the face was familiar. The old boys were right; it was Ned Buntline returned to the scene of his former exploits in the costume of a modern Greek -- a red fez cap, white satin tunic reaching almost to the knee, white silk stockings, red merino leggings, laced up over the calf of the leg, red shoes, and a blue girdle around the waist, a classical and patriotic combination of the national colors, composed the dress of this extraordinary figure. Without much regard for the proprieties of gender, Mr. BUNTLINE remarked that he was the Goddess of Liberty, and was about to head the procession at the celebration of our victories. The original programme being set aside on account of the weather, the small boys of the neighborhood improvised a procession, and the "Goddess of Liberty," represented as a modern Greek, marched up Chatham-street at their head.A strange apparition flitted through Printing-house-square yesterday morning, a remnant of the masquerade carnival; a wonder to the unchins who have their habitat in the park and "blag your boots," or abuse you, if you refuse to have them blacked.

Inquiry into the circumstances of the first ten boys and girls who won Tiffany medals and cash prizes in the Lincoln competition conducted by THE TIMES shows an interesting diversity in their lives. Two of them were severely handicapped, one by blindness, the other by deafness. A third can only be kept at school by the determined efforts of his father a pushcart peddler, who has been ill with appendicitis.
PITTSBURG, Oct. 29.--The romance of a sleeping car, it seems to me, has never been written. There are more queer things and funny things and pleasant and unpleasant things happening in a sleeping car in one night than in a steam-ship in a week; still the steamer is thought to be romantic and the car prosaic. When things do happen on a steamer...
The story of a Negro Insurrection in New-Orleans had little foundation, if the newspaper accounts may be trusted. The alarm excited by the report of the plot will probably have the effect of inducing the adoption of more severe precautionary measures.
Karloff, loose as a goose.As Senator Borah was saying of the war the other day, "there's something phony" about a feminine vote in support of the comfortable masculine conviction that woman's place in the home. Virginia Van Upp, Katharine Brush and Grace Sartwell Mason, the authors of the Paramount's new comody, "Honeymoon in Bali," have reaffirmed the ???ale prejudice so cogently and have given their own sex such short shrift that we can't believe they meant it. It may be, of course, that they chose to betray their gender out of jealousy of Madeleine Carroll, which would be understandable. We suspect the more probable explanation is that they were writing with their tongues in their cheeks, simply to humor the trousered tribe.What they have been up to, at anmy rate, is the wittily and at times naughtily written diary of a successful career girl who boasts that she has ruled love out of her life and abjectly has to take back every word of it after she meets a conquering male from Bali.The scriptic trio hasn't exactly played square with its career girl. She never has the last line; her surrender is unconditional, with none of the honors of war. But the ???an from Bali has everything—self-confidence, complacence, even an alliance with a cute little 4-year-old standing in the need of adoption. His victory is predestined, and ???ound to annoy the feminists no ???nd.Apart from its philosophy, suspect as it is, the film is engagingly played and has a half-dozen scenes which would justify our calling it one of the best comedies of the ???ear were it not for a half-dozen others which tend to cancel them out. We are delighted with Akim Tamiroff's bits as an interloping window-washer, with Fred MacMurray's account of his five Bali-???ese handmaidens, with Miss Carroll's demure explanation of her transparent nighties, with Allan Jones's singing, with Osa Massen's charming Danish accent and general behavior (that being apart from the Danish) and with the appearance of Bennie Barlett as a ???inging telegram.But, on the debit side, there is the inexplicable bit in which a 4-year-old, who has never prayed, offers her first prayer to the devil because, as she too precociously explains, "every one prays to the Lord." And there are the pointless penultimate scenes in which the writers, running a fever of inspiration, come down—and bring the comedy with them—with all manner of silly complications. This part of it is inexcusably tiresome. Had the film hewn to a straighter narrative course our report this morning should have been entirely favorable. As it runs, "Honeymoon in Bali" is bright, clever, romantic and uneven.At Loew's CriterionYour old friend, Boris Karloff, who not only makes a tidy business of being resurrected from the dead, out usually contrives to be resurrected in a sequel, does another amusing encore to life in "The Man They Could Not Hang," at Loew's Criterion. If you don't know Mr. Karloff by this time, we will explain: He is the man whose funerals are never final. You lay a wreath on Boris in one corner and he is certain to appear in another, full of obscure, graveyard resentment, sworn to get you, if it's the last thing he does.But, even when it IS the last thing he does, you can never really be sure about Boris: Drive a stake through his heart; post sentries at the cemetery gates; drop bombs on his cortege: the chances are that he will still survive. Karloff is humanity's answer to mortality. If he didn't exist, it would be necessary to invent him, if only to strengthen our faith in the essential indestructibility of the human breed.In the present case, Mr. Karloff is a physician who eventually heals himself of death by means of an artificial heart (not to be confused with the Lindbergh patent) which makes it possible for a surgeon to perform more efficient operations by placing the patient in a mortuary condition before the operation instead of afterward. Arrested before he can restore life to his first voluntary guinea pig, and convicted before you can say Boris Karloff, Mr. Karloff is summarily hanged and, being legally dead, devotes the remainder of his artificially restored life to the agreeable task of getting even with the judge, the jury, the prosecuting attorney and the material witnesses for their zeal in going after his life's blood.He fails, of course, but the failures of Mr. Karloff are more interesting than the successes of ordinary homicides.
Little can be added at present to the statements which we have published concerning the arrests that Col. BAKER'S detective officer have recently made among the bounty-brokers. Further arrests...  Little can be added at present to the statements which we have published concerning the arrests that Col. BAKER'S detective officer have recently made among the bounty-brokers. Further arrests were made yesterday; but in the Colonel's absence his subordinates do not feel at liberty to disclose names; and the public must, therefore, wait patiently until the detective officers think it prudent to make a complete revelation. This time may not come until the accused are brought to trial. We have, however, the gratifying assurance that there is to be no unnecessary delay in arraigning the prisoners, it being Col. BAKER's desire to finish his work at the earliest period possible; and with this view he has gone to Washington to make arrangements for the speedy assembling of a court-martial for the trial of the persons whom he has sent to the Old Capitol prison.
The Tammany Hall Democracy, summoned by big posters, Capt.

If everybody would "let well enough alone," and not officiously or otherwise seek to mend it, everybody would be better off. While not impugning the charitable motives of certain ladies and gentlemen who insist on voluntarily visiting the different United States hospitals hereabouts, and distributing fruit and other luxuries to the sick, their good sense and discretion are open to severe criticism.  If everybody would "let well enough alone," and not officiously or otherwise seek to mend it, everybody would be better off. While not impugning the charitable motives of certain ladies and gentlemen who insist on voluntarily visiting the different United States hospitals hereabouts, and distributing fruit and other luxuries to the sick, their good sense and discretion are open to severe criticism. They do actual injury by a well meant but ignorant application of their charity. There is nothing wanted in any of the United States hospitals, either in the way of comforts, luxuries, or aught else, that the United States Government does not liberally supply; and as to the surgical and medical care, the nursing and the attendance, these are conceded to be of the very best. It is to be presumed that the surgeons in charge know better the condition of their patients and their requirements than occasional philanthropic visitors, who have neither the opportunity nor the inclination to inform themselves of the particulars and condition of individual cases. They visit the hospitals certainly with the best intentions, loaded down with fruit, jams, jellies, &c., etc., and indiscriminately and profusely turn them over to the sick, when in many cases such are of immediate and positive injury. We know of two instances of death caused by this thoughtless philanthropy. The Government, as we have said, furnishes all things in profusion -- fruit, vegetables, preserves, &c., &c., and they are dealt out to the patients with all the liberality their cases will admit of. No more tender care could be taken of the soldiers, nor more solicitude exhibted for them, and it is to be doubted if as much, by these well-meaning but indiscreet and touchey outsiders of either gender, than is evinced and exhibited by the U.S. officers in charge of them. This meddlesome intrusion, well-meaning it is, works no good, but actual harm, and we notice lately has induced a very untruthful and ungenerous reflection on our Government and its officers, in a paper which, were it better posted as to the facts, would better post the public on them.
The crowd which gathered about Tammany last evening, dispersed and reassembled several times before the old wigwam showed any signs of life. Not only was there no "Rynders pocket-piece," to scare the echoes in the Park, but there was no tarbarrel, there were no rockets or Roman candles. Not to speak of a full Band of music, there was not even a single drum or fife. Tammany was dismal.

The popular festivities and superstitions connected with the commencement of the New Year can probably be derived from an earlier period of antiquity than any other now-existing customs.

FULLEE, has been issued by WALKER, WISE & CO., of Boston. Chaplain FULLER was a brother of MARGARET OSOLI, and early in the war, accepted the chaplaincy of a New-England regiment. The story of his career is told mainly from the pen of the deceased. The men and things discussed belong to the active present, and are fresh with interest. An excellent account of the combat between the Merrimac and the Monitor will be found to be one of the most interesting chapters of the volume.

ROBBERY OF JEWELRY IN BLEECKER-STREET  A CASE OF MISPLACED CONFIDENCE. Two parties named ELLEN FOX and WM.

LAMBERT, were yesterday brought before Justice QUACKENBUSH, upon the complaint of Mrs. CHARLOTTE GUEST, of No. 391 Bleecker-street, who alleges that the prisoners stole from her private apartment, on the 5th inst., property consisting of a box of jewelry, a crape shawl, a gold watch and chain, and other valuables, amounting in all to $267. The testimony discloses the fact that ELLEN had recently been in the employ of Mrs. GUEST, as a dressmaker, and while there she had an opportunity to learn the place where her employer kept her valuables. The evening previous to the theft ELLEN learned that the complainant would be out the next forenoon; she accordingly made her arrangements, entered Mrs. GUEST's private apartment when there was no one in the house to interfere with her plans, took the property and departed. The shawl was subsequently recovered at a pawn shop, where it had been pledged by ELLEN. The remainder of the property has not been found. The other prisoner, LAMBERT, is known to have presented some of the other articles at a pawn shop in Greene-street, but the pawnbroker refund to receive them in pledge on the ground that he suspected them to have been stolen. The latter prisoner has recently abandoned an intelligent and amiable wife and seven children, who reside in Forty-third-street, and has since been living with ELLEN FOX at the corner of Crosby and Spring streets, where both parties were arrested by Officer BOWER, of the Second District Police Court. The Magistrate committed ELLEN for trial. The other party was discharged, the evidence upon this complaint being deemed insufficient.

It is really amusing to see the effect upon the London Times of the capture of New-Orleans. The events of that desperate seafight seem to have thrown the Thunderer into a state of doubt and confusion quite remarkable to witness. But the same determination never to admit that any possible good could come out of our Nazareth; the same utter blindness to any valor or skill or determination on the part of our officers and soldiers is just as apparent as heretofore. Thus, for instance, it quotes that expression of one of our Commanders, that "it was a contest of iron hearts in wooden vessels, and iron-clad with iron beaks, and the iron hearts won;" of which it says that "this Commander goes so far as to declare, in his very pardonable exultation, that the victory was nothing less than a victory of wood over iron;" and it declares that if that statement "were an actual description of the affair, the story would be almost beyond comprehension or belief."
If we may judge by the experiences of Saturday, the people of New-York are not likely to make themselves particularly ridiculous in connection with the Japanese. They have seen too many strangers of all sects and colors, and tasted too heavy excitements, to be thrown very far off their balance  even by the envoys of a prince whose very existence was a sort of myth to most of us a very few yeas ago.

Much as we have been abused and quizzed for our "wild enthusiasm," our people have a native good sense which discriminates between events which touch the passions and those which merely move the wonder of the crowd.
It was with the air of a man profoundly indifferent to his own successes that Gerard Strickland, twitching his cuffs and stretching his arms before letting his hands fall into his lap, sank back into the luxurious arm chair by his library fire, after throwing on the table the letter that announced his promotion to an enviable post in the Civil Service.

--Mystery is the great staple of novel writers, especially of those of the female persuasion.

These latter transfer the veil from their own faces to shroud the characters they invent. At every turn and corner of their stories they mystify the reader by all manner of weak devices, pointing in a different direction from that they actually intend to take, flitting before you with simulated lameness, like the lapwing, to lead you away from the nest where their young brood of callow secrets lie. Of this art, Mrs. HENRY WOOD is the high handmaiden. She moves in a more mysterious way her wonders to perform than our own FERNANDO does. Her characters go through her stories as ships in crowded seas glide around in a fog, ringing bells to keep out of each other's way and carefully avoiding a meeting. Her last work, very properly christined The Mystery, is published by PETERSON & BRO., of Philadelphia, from advance sheets, for which a fabulous price is said to have been paid. The story is an ingenious one, and well managed in the main. A murder is committed, without any adequate motive on the part of the murderer, and the blood is sprinkled around in such a mysterious manner, that it is difficult to fasten it to the skirts of any one. A little girl, in a very innocent manner, manages to be everywhere where she should not be, and to hear everything that was least intended for her to hear. Were she not more retentive of talk than most young ladies are, she might set a great deal of doubt and trouble at rest in the early part of the story; but she preserves a most remarkable reticence, and permits the characters to go knocking their heads against each other, as awkward people do in dancing the Lancers. She is a very remarkable little girl, indeed, and eventually a most exceptional young lady. Truth compels the admission that Mrs. WOOD weaves quite an exciting and interesting chain of narrative from what seems at first glance to be rather slender material, though most readers will guess what is behind the mask long before the authoress removes it.

CommencementThe third annual commencement exercises of the Cooper Institute took place in the large hall of the building on last Friday evening, in the presence of a fine audience. The literary exercises consisted of orations by ALEX, THAIRE, MARSHALL, LONG, EWING M. FOX, J.F. CHAPMAN and FRANCIS J. TUCKER, and a very meritorious poem on "The Progress of Learning." by ALFRED E. PARKS, of the Chemistry Class. The singing, by about three hundred of the pupils, who were present on the stage, and led by Mr. BRISTOW, elicited deserved applause, especial merit being attached to Miss G. HARTSHORNE, and Miss M. MCINTYRE, M.J.A. KEANE, and R.J. JOHNSTON, who each sang solos.
Presbyterian Assemblies, O. >amp; N. S., Proceedings ofIn the New School General Assembly, in session at Dayton, O., on Wednesday last, in reply to an overture from the Presbytery of St. Lawrence, in regard to appointing a committee to confer with a similar committee of the Old School Church, as to the practicability and the terms of reunion, the following overture was unanimously adopted:
Last evening closed the festival at Plymouth Church, and concluded the cordial welcome by the scholars to Rev. Mr. BEECHER. There was the same profusion of flowers, the wreathing wore the same rich green appearance, the canaries still poured forth their flood of song, while the emblems and mottoes seemed to lose none of their significance or appropriateness by being viewed a second time. In the Sunday School-room, the fountain and the bower surrounding it had lost none of their attractiveness, continuing to be a special object of admiration. It may not be improper here to state that the fountain, presented by a lady to the Sunday School at their first festival, is permanently located in this room. In its sparkling jet of limpid water, it must always be suggestive of the purity of which it is typical.Last evening closed the festival at Plymouth Church, and concluded the cordial welcome by the scholars to Rev.

A meeting was held at the Astor House, yesterday, for the purpose of organizing a Home Guard, Hon. CHAUNCEY SHAFFER in the chair. It is proposed that 20,000 men be enrolled for this guard, 10,000 whom will be armed with the Minie rifle. Many of our most influential business men have already enrolled their names in this corps, and it is expected that the majority of our leading merchants will become members of the Metropolitan Home Guard. Mr. GEORGE LAW was present and was offered the command of the Legion, but declined, stating that his sympathies were with the movement, but that his many engagements would not allow him to accept the honor. He was then offered the chairmanship of the Association, which he refused on the same grounds. Finally he was elected a member of the Committee for the further and better organization of this movement. Mr. LAW also said that he would assist the movement with all his might, and that his aid would be given just as freely, and to as great an extent, as though he were at the head of the organization.
EIGHTEENTH DAY. The House reassembled at 9 o'clock. Morning Prayer was said by Rev. Dr. MEADE, assisted by Rev. Dr. VAN INGEN.

SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Thursday, Jan. 5, 1860. There is not a poorhouse in California. This is  not owing to any lack of practical charity; there is not a community in Christendom that springs sooner to pick up a falling brother than this. But it comes of the fact that there is nobody here to put in a poorhouse. If, as occasionally happens, a woman, whose ...  SAN FRANCISCO, Cal., Thursday, Jan. 5, 1860.
Grand Reception at New-YorkThe night of the 20th of November will be ever memorable in the social history of the metropolis, as the occasion when the more prominent men of the city open house to the many who desired to greet a hero and shout acclaim in honor of a glorious soldier. When it was first known that Gen. GRANT would, with his, family tarry a few days in this city, it was suggested that a public demonstration of some nature should be made in recognition of the esteem entertained for him by our citizens. Two objections were urged: one, that the visit here would be quite brief, and entirely occupied to private businees; the other, that such a proceedings would be in absolute disregard of the General's reported dislike of parade or show. The project was abandoned for a time, but upon consultation it was ascertained that the General could so arrange his affairs as to find a spare evening for the reception of his friends. Several meetings were held by the gentlemen prominent in the matter, and after a little the project assumed shape and became the topic of town talk. Circulars were issued to one hundred and fifty persons, suggesting that each member of the body subscribe $100 toward defraying the expenses of the reception. The gentlemen invited were only too happy to comply, and having paid their money, were admitted to the General Committee. The following are the names of the subscribers:

SMITH, who led a corps of  ALEXANDRIA, Wednesday, March 23, 1864.
LONDON, Friday, Jan. 6, 1860. The Rifle Volunteer movement is still on the  increase, but the fructification of the crop of Cadmus is by no means so real or so solid as may be imagined over Europe, except by the best-informed men, or even in England, where popular notions prevail.  LONDON, Friday, Jan. 6, 1860. The Rifle Volunteer movement is still on the increase, but the fructification of the crop of Cadmus is by no means so real or so solid as may be imagined over Europe, except by the best-informed men, or even in England, where popular notions prevail. A foolish Lord, one of the modern type of fussy, priggish, conceited, busy noblemen, is doing more to check, and injure the growth of the volunteer corps by his efforts to render them ridiculous in appearance, than the titled utilitarian coxcomb can possibly be aware of. Lord ELCHO has hitherto been connected with arts rather than arms. In the former he has displayed a connoisseurship just sufficient to obtain him the respect of the coteries in London, and the contempt of artists and amateurs on the Continent. That he is a humbug in judgment, and a flunkey in patronage, I scarcely think that MORRIS MOORE, that most renowned and ill-treated art-critic, would deny. There are men born to be wrong, even when most intending to do right. There are insects which perform the functions of life when their brains are removed and replaced by cotton-wool. Among human insects there is often to be seen a melancholy amount of activity coexistent with the normal absence of the cerebral matter. Give such a creature opportunities in the shape of a fortune, a title, a seat in the House, and a diarrhoea loquendi or scribendi, and it is surprising what mischief may be effected by so small a thing.

CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMAN: The object which brings us together, even if it had not been so satisfactorily stated and so persuasively enforced by the gentleman who have proceded me, sufficiently explains itself. MR. CHAIRMAN, LADIES AND GENTLEMAN: The object which brings us together, even if it had not been so satisfactorily stated and so persuasively enforced by the gentleman who have proceded me, sufficiently explains itself. At the call of the President, seconded with the most praiseworthy and almost unexampled energy of the Governor of Massachusetts, a numerous force of volunteers has patriotically hastened to the defence of the Capital of the United States, threatened with invasion. The war, for a long time though in profound peace secretly prepared for, has been openly commenced by the South, by the seizure of the undefended forts, arsenals, dockyards, [???] and custom-houses of the United States, and the plunder of the property contained in them, in flagrant violation of the law of the land, if the South is still in the Union, and equally flagrant violation of every principle of international law, if she is out of the Union. But even these acts of treason and rebellion (for such they are,) are thrown into the shade by the last unutterable outrage upon the flag of the Union, at Fort Sumter, (a fort which no more belongs to South Carolina than it does to New York or Massachusetts) which has carried twenty millions of freemen as one man to its defence.

Craik, G. L. English Language and LiteratureIf there is one subject of a purely literary nature that proves attractive to every person of ordinary culture -- a common ground where members of all sects, and parties meet on an equal footing, induced by an instinctive taste for the study -- it is certainty our vernacular tongue, and the wide range of inquiry connected with its mechanism, etymology and distinctive characteristics, compared with other, languages of the earth, as an organ of national thought and expression. An aptitude for these pursuits has long been shown by Americans. Acute minds have always found pleasure in dwelling on them. The number or works on grammar produced in this country during the present century far surpasses what England has done; nay more, that the mother country is indebted to them for its standard vocabulary and the generally accepted rules of its speech is proved in a moment when the names of NOAH WEBSTER and LINDLEY MURRAY are recalled; while in the higher learning of modern philology the works of GEORGE P. MARSH, though but recently written, at once took acknowledged rank among the most valuable contributions ever made to the history and philosophy of the language.
What and Where to BuyAn unsuccessful tradesman from the backwoode--who does not diligently peruse the advertisements in the TIMES--says that his most perplexing task is that of making his purchases when he comes to New-York.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 -- Chief points of agreement and disagreement between the reports on revision of the securities laws submitted today to Congress by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a committee from the financial industry follow.
It is only a chance coincidence that the Institute of International Law opened its annual meeting in this country at the very time when Prime Minister MACDONALD was here. Yet there is a subtle if undesigned relation between the two events.
Addressing the Canadian Bar Association, Mr. JAMES M. BECK of New York urges that wars should be made impossible by international laws, courts to interpret them, and "some co-operative effort to enforce them." This may he a counsel for angels rather than for Canadians or Americans.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 15 -- In an oral opinion rejecting a plea of Texas refiners for an injunction against orders of Secretary Ickes prohibiting interstate shipment of oil produced in violation of State regulations, Justice Joseph M.

ENGLAND has discovered, as New York State sometime may, that adultery is not the only valid grounds for divorce. It took a humorist not only to point out the fact but to do something about it.
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 -- E.M. Ebert, director of the bureau of inquiry of the Interstate Commerce Commission, asserted in a brief filed today with the commission that the Alleghany Corporation has violated Paragraph (4) of Section 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act, and that the commission should take such action as, in its judgment, is warranted to prevent further continuance of such violation.

THE "unwritten laws" of bridge -- questions of ethics and sportsmanship -- are far more carefully observed in expert play than in casual bridge games.

Much has been heard of what the Volstead act accomplishes, or fails to accomplish; little has been done to call attention to its unique character. It is the only law which creates a crime and incites to felony. It is the only law which makes inebriety a vaunted achievement and not a misfortune to repent of.
The Board of City Magistrates has found a sensible and practical means of dealing with open-air seditionaries. The City Magistrates hold that the spouters of sedition can be punished, upon due evidence from the police, under the statute defining disorderly conduct.
When Lieut. BECKER'S second trial closed on May 22, with a verdict of "guilty," seventeen months almost to a day had passed since his first trial closed in the same manner. Yesterday it was announced that his counsel would appeal again. How long that process will delay the final outcome of the case it is impossible to say.
Two months ago the Supreme Court declared that under the Clayton act of 1914 and the Norris-La Guardia act of 1932 labor unions (unless they combine with non-labor groups) are exempt from the anti-trust laws. This week the court, without giving its reasons, decided against the Department of Justice in three more cases brought against unions under those laws.

The report of the State Housing Commission emphasizes the relation between emergency measures and a permanent program of relief. The emergency is passing. Rents are decreasing in the open market. Vacancies are more numerous, due to enlarged construction.
Every great reform which has been effected has consisted not in doing something new, but in undoing something old. The most valuable additions to legislation have been enactments destructive of previous legislation, and the best laws which have been passed have been those by which former laws have been repealed.
Discussion of the merits of the mimeograph patent case decision must be influenced by facts which did not appear in the pleadings, and which the court could not consider. The sale of ink which was held to be an infringement of the patent for the machine was not one in the ordinary course of trade.
The statement in the Topics of the Times in Monday's TIMES that the Hillsville killers of court officials have proved that they were quite like other criminals when the law fell upon them with all its power is quite correct, and the romanticism of their criminal acts as due to their environment and heredity, believed in among those of a wider enlightenment, is, as he says, no excuse for sympathy.
Isn't it about time that legal procedure, civil and criminal, were simplified? The verbiage of the law is endless, it makes for confusion. The report upon the involved form of murder indictments made to the Bar Association by Prof. MIKELL of the University of Pennsylvania and Prof. KEEDY of Northwestern University gives one instance of the difficulty.

It is a threadbare old saying that international law is neither international nor law, but a body of rules and usages.

Here is one citizen who wishes to defend the Supreme Court and the Constitution in answer to critics. Through lack of understanding these malcontents go about disparaging our fundamental law. They ask many foolish questions, such as: Why aren't all laws before they go into effect tested for constitutionality in the Supreme Court?

IT must be the backwash from the recent attack on the United States Supreme Court that has left the baseball umpires jittery.

Traffic courts, the only legal tribunals that many of our people are ever called upon to visit, have long been neglected places.

Judges, lawyers and litigants have become increasingly aware of the delays on the calendars of the Supreme Court in New York City. Justice is too slow when it takes two and one-half years to bring a lawsuit to trial, and justice delayed can turn out to be no justice at all.
In an address two weeks ago to the American Law Institute, Chief Justice HUGHES referred to divisions in our higher courts. Why should it be expected, he asked, that they would not exist? In sciences and philosophy, as well as in theology, experts of the greatest reputation differed, and it would be strange if judges did not.
One of the important matters debated yesterday in the Senate and scheduled for a vote today is ratification of an agreement which would grant Senate consent to the President's accepting for America the compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice.
All eyes will be on Mr. Justice Black when the Supreme Court meets today. This is inevitable in the circumstances.

To the uninitiated lay mind the issue in the gold cases before the Supreme Court appears largely to have been presented not on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the government's action. The issue is Constitution vs. fait accompli in the plea made by Mr. Cummings that there will be chaos if the court rule adversely to the government.
In a report which has received the approval of the American Bar Association, the National Committee Conference of Judicial Councils finds that many traffic courts in all sections of the country are "hopelessly inadequate to function effectively as a corrective agency in the traffic accident problem."
Before it reached the Supreme Court the Railway Pension Act was held by a lower court to be unconstitutional primarily for the reason that it attempted to establish a Federal pension plan for all employes of the transportation companies, "making no dis-"tinction between those engaged in in-"terstate commerce and those not so "engaged."
The Municipal Bankruptcy Act, on which the Supreme Court has just handed down a decision, is a heritage of the panic stage of the depression. Strong pressure for its adoption appeared early in 1933, and one year later Congress completed action on the measure.
Proposals to alter the procedure or the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court have been thick in Washington since the NRA decision. One plan is to have Congress pass an act declaring that no decision of the court shall be binding unless concurred in by two-thirds of the judges.
Minor causes, personal and political, entered into the rejection of the World Court treaty by the Senate. The leadership of the Administration forces was too languid. Senator ROBINSON Was so much at ease in Zion that he continued to tell the Washington correspondents and the President that ratification was certain.
THE abuses that have been disclosed do not strike at people of wealth and power. They oppress those who are poor and helpless, under circumstances where the oppressor enjoys practical immunity. A court in which these practices could have obtained, or in which they may obtain again, is not a court of justice.
President ROOSEVELT must have anticipated the strong protest made in many places against his proposal to increase the membership of the Supreme Court.
They do not play in Madison Square Garden and they stay pretty much in their own league, so Columbia's quintet perhaps receives less attention from the public than a basketball team of its status deserves. The fact is that Paul Mooney has fashioned one of his finest teams in the comparative obscurity of Morningside Heights.
One of the most improved players in the metropolitan area this year is Dick Holub of Long Island University. It hardly would be proper to say that he has been overlooked because it is extremely difficult to miss any one standing 6 feet 5 inches tall.

Mr. Dooley once remarked that, while the Constitution follows the flag, the Supreme Court follows the election returns. Whether that toe a libel or no, it is no reflection on the court to say that it is generally alive to the exigencies of the times. Take, for example, the increasing responsibilities of the Presidency.
Attorney General Cummings is still following hard on the heels of that inveterate enemy of justice, delay. His annual statistical table showing the time required to bring civil cases to trial after joinder of issue has been of great help to the Judicial Conference of senior circuit justices presided over by the Chief Justice.
With all good intentions, the basketball rules committee has enormously complicated the task of floor and desk officials by permitting the entry of substitutes after a field goal. This point might profitably be restudied when the court legislators assemble next Spring.
A dissenting voice was raised yesterday to the University of California proposal that it play its Madison Square Garden game with New York University on Dec. 18 without a centre tap. The Golden Bears, blithely ignoring national rules, have been engaging in court contests on the Coast for several seasons without a jump ball.

On the first day's calendar of the Court of Conciliation there were fifty cases. One was settled. The Court of Conciliation was set up by Justices LAUER and DAVIES on behalf of the forty-eight Justices of the Municipal Court to save themselves in their hopeless struggles with their crowded calendars.
A glum young man who had wagered against Long Island University Wednesday night when the Blackbirds played West Texas State voiced his disgust at his mistake afterward.
From a source that is unquestionably authentic but must be kept secret, it was learned yesterday that Seton Hall's basketball team, winner of thirty-six straight, had received a direct offer to appear at Madison Square Garden. The plan was to pit the Pirates against Georgetown in one game of a special double-header on the night of Feb. 10 at the Eighth Avenue arena.
A schismatic pronouncement by Neil Cohalan that his Manhattan squad would take a fling at the "firehouse" basketball so spectacularly and successfully demonstrated here by such visitors as Rice, Washington and Rhode Island supplied added evidence that the local court mentors are begining to reconsider their traditional tactical conservatism.

It was twenty-two years ago this month that the first children's court was established in the bounds of Greater New York. But these early courts were not distinct courts in their organization, facilities and powers. They were little more than separate rooms or buildings, in which the cases of children could be heard apart from those of hardened criminals.

An incident that occurred last week in the Brooklyn College gymnasium, where the Kingsmen were engaging Manhattan, should not be passed without comment. It was a close game, the Jaspers ultimately eking out a one-point victory, but the outcome is only secondary in this little court episode.
The Interstate Commerce Commission is a quasi-judicial body. Attempting to sway its opinions and decisions, except by argument before it, is as improper as it would be to endeavor to bring pressure upon a judge in favor of a litigant.
New York University still is unbeaten on the court and looks very much as though it might stay that way for quite some time. And yet there is a strong group which believes very firmly that the University of Kentucky quintet is the one that will perform the feat of snapping that long Violet streak.
The death of the pivot play, like the story of Mark Twain's demise, is "slightly exaggerated." That point was brought forth very forcibly last Saturday at the Garden double-header as Long Island University, Temple and St. John's resurrected the bucket play and set it up all over the court.
Clair Bee, Long Island University's energetic basketball coach, makes it his business to know as much about his opponents as he knows about his own team. Very often this added burden of knowledge is so onerous that the Blackbird mentor wishes he did not take his scouting so seriously.
The season still is young, but it is difficult to see any of the other teams in town beating City College for the metropolitan championship the Beavers captured a year ago. By turning back St. John's in the Garden last Wednesday night City hurdled its biggest obstacle and the path looks reasonably clear from here in.
The proposal of the French Government to ratify the debt settlement with the United States, only after putting into a preamble or postscript certain safeguarding clauses, leaves Washington quite unruffled. For the Administration it is officially stated that these extra flourishes of the pen of France when signing the agreement will make no difference.
Opening the doors of the Permanent International Court by the Council of the League of Nations to Russia, Germany, Turkey, Hungary and Mexico makes it virtually a planetary court.
Basketball's leading exponent of the offense, bluff and hearty Frank Keaney of Rhode Island State, cleared up some of the mystery behind those three-figure scores his teams frequently roll up when he spoke before local coaches and writers assembled for a luncheon at the Hotel Piccadilly yesterday.
A year ago St. John's had a pretty good basketball team, but it lacked spark and drive. When its scoring twins, Rip Kaplinsky and Java Gotkin, had "on" nights, the Redmen looked like a great combination. But when they couldn't find the hoop, or bewildered their teammates more than the opposition with their tricky ball-handling, then Buck Freeman's young men were very ordinary indeed.

The decision of the International Court of Justice that Albania must pay Britain over $2,000,000 in damages for the mining of two British destroyers in 1946 brings to a close -- so far as the Court is concerned -- the first case it has had to decide since its reconstitution under the Charter of the United Nations.
It seems to me that, regardless of the merits of the controversy between any citizen, corporate or individual, and the Commander in Chief, it is incumbent upon every loyal citizen to obey the orders and directives of the Commander in Chief in time of war, and if, after so obeying, the citizen feels aggrieved, to then appeal to the courts for redress.
It was to be expected that Colonel STIMSON, on landing in San Francisco on his way to take up the duties of Secretary of State, would express in no uncertain terms his opinion about the proposals to place restrictions on the entry...
ed, The New World Ct; cites UNO Assembly and Security Council task to elect judges to ct in accordance with UNO Charter
There is a system of legal costs so deeply ingrained in the operation of our civil courts that it is seldom questioned. Any person who wishes to institute an action must first deposit with the court a sum of money to defray expenses. Without cash, the legal mills will not turn.
The subcommittee of the House Military Affairs Committee, in its study of courts-martial and its suggestions for reform, is carrying out a clearly authorized function of the Congress. Many of the reforms it sugests for Army courts are long overdue.
In the annual report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts one looks first for the result of the substantial filling of the long-standing vacancies in judgeships that had been an obstacle to the transaction of business in the preceding fiscal year.

The code of military justice submitted to Congress by Defense Secretary Forrestal includes many improvements, over the present codes of the three services, in addition to possessing the major advantage of uniformity. It still does not include the one basic reform urged by every civilian group that the armed services have appointed to advise them -- namely, separation of courts-martial from command and placement in an independent Judge Advocate General's office.
In your excellent editorial in THE NEW YORK TIMES for Dec. 1, where you discussed the vacancy in the Court of Appeals of this state caused by the resignation of Judge Thacher because of his failing health, you point out aptly that "the best available person" should be designated by the Governor to fill this highly important vacancy.
Before recessing for the summer the Supreme Court handed down opinions this week dealing with three of the more controversial sections of the Taft-Hartley Act, but in only one case has the issue been finally disposed of.

Authority gets S C Sup Ct action to restrain lower ct from halting purchase of 2 private utilities
There can be no doubt that ALEXANDER HOWAT and his five associates were in contempt of the Industrial Court of Kansas. In the face of an injunction they called a strike at two mines, and on the most trivial provocation. The only question was as to the age of a young miner, upon which depended the rate of his pay. In the absence of any other motive the...
The Supreme Court has reversed its position on an important point of law precisely at a time when the future of the court itself is the dominant political question before the country.
The Supreme Court of the United States is and ought to be the most deeply respected institution of the Federal Government. On its independence and integrity rest the precious rights of every citizen. Its members ought to be chosen for their proven judicial ability and temperament, and not merely for their political and social opinions or their amiable personalities.
In his address on Tuesday night before the Association of the Bar of the City of New York Mayor La Guardia informed his audience that the courts in New York City were costing nearly $4,000,000 a year more than the entire Federal court system.

Confronted with popular resentment against what opponents of the plan described as "packing the court," its defenders have sought to invoke precedent. Did not President LINCOLN and President GRANT adopt the same recourse in the Sixties?
In a large way and a way that is also just, it is inevitable that the discovery of huckstering judicial appointments in this city should have a powerful political effect. It must seriously damage Tammany. It must....

The setback administered to Georgetown by Penn State the other night stamps the Nittany Lions as the prize spoilers of the major basketball circuit. The term is not meant in any derogatory sense but more as an explanation of a team that fails just a mite short of being a standout but has beaten some of the top-ranking quintets of the East.

Every once in a while an intracity game at Madison Square Garden ends in a lop-sided score, but not often. The double-header there the other night did not look like a good match. St. John's and N.Y.U., supposedly two of the stronger local quintets, were playing Manhattan and St. Francis, two of the lesser lights.

In an editorial on freedom and labor THE NEW YORK TIMES asserts that the right to work is an accepted principle in liberal democratic countries. I beg to differ.

MEMBERS of the New York Art Directors Club are giving us glimpses of the art they themselves like to create off duty.

ROME, Feb. 28 -- Bulgaria will join the Three-Power Pact in Vienna tomorrow, it was learned today, and with this step the Axis will have completed the diplomatic work preliminary to its forthcoming military strategy in the Balkans.

RUNNING down parallel passages is a species of literary detective work, with the result that the accused is haled into court charged with plagiary.

Thousands of men will be seeking jobs when the war is over. Many of them will come from the armed services. Many others will be left unemployed by the transition to peace production. And youngsters leaving school must begin earning.
Luther Huston's article on the Presidency in THE TIMES Magazine is very illuminating. May I, however, point out an error. Mr. Huston states: "In the field of legislation his [the President's] powers are advisory and he can exercise authority over Congress only on extraordinary occasions."
A report has been made public by the War Contracts subcommittee of the Senate Military Affairs Committee proposing a new kind of Federal budget, a "job budget." The whole document is instructive because it accepts nearly all the popular economic slogans that have lately been drifting about in the air, and attempts to enact them all together in a single bill.

CLUSTERED in front of a steamship pier on West Street in New York is a group of men discussing  something that appears to be of great interest to all of them.
In an all-out war we need more, not fewer, hard-boiled, tough, fighting generals. To crucify a general for telling off, even if physically, a soldier who seemingly exhibited cowardice is the worst sabotage that any Axis propaganda could possibly inflict on our armies.
The General Council of Britain's Trades Union Congress (T. U. C.) has refused to concur in the demands of some 5,000,000 trade unionists for immediate wage increases. In its annual report, just made public, the Council takes its stand beside Sir Stafford Cripps and the Labor Government on the question of wage policy.
In the two decades between the close of the last World War and the beginning of this one it was fashionable and smart to say that there was no such thing as a good war, and that one would go to jail before he would be drafted into the Army. There were many who said these things and meant them at the time.
On Tuesday, September 3, 1946, the floor of the New York Stock Exchange was swept, metaphorically speaking, by three tidal waves of selling.

Mayor O'Dwyer's order for a survey leading to thorough revision of city civil service classifications and pay schedules constitutes recognition of a long-neglected and highly important problem.

In some respects, beset with political troubles and economic ills, Mr. HOOVER has disappointed those who voted for him in the belief that he would be quick and firm in dealing with all public matters. His failure to assume real leadership while the tariff bill was framing undoubtedly made that bad bill a worse one.
President Truman sounded the note upon his return from Potsdam. Travelers who have seen conditions in the war-devastated lands of Europe, Asia and the Pacific agree that the approaching winter will be the most critical in world history--a winter of starvation, destitution and disease.

PARIS (By Wireless). THE poilu bas donned his war harness again and he won't doff it until  after the victory parade, however long it may be delayed. He set out with stern mien and jaws clenched, but soon his old poilu spirit reasserted itself: he packed up his troubles in his kit bag and is now ready to take things as they come.

The thing an unemployed worker wants most is a job. During most of the last eight years finding new jobs has been relatively easy. Now there are more people looking for jobs than there were yesterday. This situation confronts the public employment offices in New York and other industrial states with a challenge that they must be physically equipped to meet.
The Citizens Budget Commission has now completed publication of its report on five city departments, made at the request of Mayor O'Dwyer and with the helpful cooperation of city employes and business specialists. There is no question that the city will follow up the recommendations of this report, which sees the possibility ultimately -but not immediately -- of a $30,000,000 annual elimination of waste motion.

Two things stand out as especially significant in the Government report on employment and payrolls in manufacturing industries last month. One is the striking reversal of a usual seasonal trend. Only twice during the decade from 1923 to 1932 inclusive did employment improve in June as compared with May, and in both cases the gain was merely nominal.

FACTORY workers and craftsmen in industry are the new commuters. Between home and plant they often travel by automobile more than 100 miles a day. This fluid form of transportation is proving vital to the national defense manufacturing program, which thus draws personnel from an area of 100 miles around any plant.
When the Legislature adjourned on May 20, it left in the hands of the Governor 678 bills subject to the provision of the Constitution that "no bill shall become a law after the final adjournment of the Legislature unless approved by the Governor within thirty days after such adjournment."
The 2,000,000-ton merchant-shipping pool being assembled by the Maritime Commission to assist the British to victory will draw heavily on the lines operating in coastwise trade. That means that on top of all the extra freighting caused by the defense program much of the tonnage now moved along the coasts in ships must in the future go over the rails in trains and the highways in trucks.

While Michael Curtiz, an expert in odd camera angles and compelling dissolves, has introduced some interesting protographic ideas in his latest production. "Good Time Charley," the story of this film teems with cheap sentiment and extravagant comedy. The incidents are handled in an extremely haphazard fashion, so that, in the circumstances, almost anything might happen. There is a fund of material in this subject, but little of it is effective. It is like using a bludgeon to bring tears and explosives to create laughter."Good Time Charley" is a story of an old tragedian who, like Job, is sorely tried. His wife is killed by a mercenary producing manager. He eventually loses his sight and his daughter becomes the unfortunate wife of the son of the man who is virtually her mother's murderer.This picture, with less detail and some true conception of story-telling, might have been an approach to "Debureau"; but it isn't. It is one of those films where the poor old man with a half-wit pal finds that the whole world is treading upon him. "Good Time Charley's" real name is Charles Keene. He is the type of actor dubbed a ham.In the early episodes this production looks promising, but after Keene's wife dies, the narrative is told in a childish fashion. Apparently, Rosita Keene, beloved by Charles, her father, also adores the old man. Nevertheless she succeeds in keeping out of his way when she is most needed and he is able to deceive her into the belief that he is a whale of a success on the stage. Poor, old Charles is saving up his money, or that of Bill Collins, his faithful pal, because he has been told that an operation costing $1.000 will give him back his sight. Just when he has about that sum. Rosita appears and tells her father that she is sorely in need of funds to go abroad. So Charles gives his daughter the currency that was stored in his abode.Subsequently the old actor learns that John Hartwell was responsible for Elaine Keene's death. So you have a sequence wherein Charles goes to Hartwell's office. He is not able to see the man he wants to shoot, and he is not even given credit for being able to hear Hartwell's movements. Excitement or some acute stage of hatred eventually causes the blurred form of Hartwell to appear before the veteran actor in a mirror. Charles believes that he is pointing his pistol at Hartwell and he pulls the trigger only to hear a crash of glass.This scene is well acted, but poorly directed. Warner Oland gives a splendid interpretation of Charles Keene, both before and after he is attacked by blindness. Clyde Cook has some amusing tricks, but most of them are terribly out of place in this type of yarn. Helene Costello does fairly well as Rosita and Montague Love is competent as John Hartwell.The Movietone news reel is exceptionally interesting. In one stretch the Prince of Wales is heard and seen addressing a gathering. His voice is not only clear, but it would easily be recognized as that of the Prince. Another episode deals with the recent Yale-Princeton football game and in this reproduction one gains a vivid impression of the excitement in the Yale Bowl.While Michael Curtiz, an expert in odd camera angles and compelling dissolves, has introduced some interesting protographic ideas in his latest production.

THE National Women's Trade Union League of America has  issued a call to the women labor leaders in foreign countries to foregather in Washington for an  international labor congress of working women during the week before the big International Labor Conference is held.
De Forest audion amplifier, by means of which wireless messages were heard through ordinary telephone receiver, demonstrated
I am sure that if the reasoning of the article on "Labor's Cruelty to Labor" which appeared in to-day's issue of THE TIMES showed a closer acquaintance with the character of the demands of the Ladies' Waistmakers' Union and what the "recognition of the union" for which we are struggling means, it certainly would not have ascribed to Miss O'Reilly's contentions any cruelty to labor in general or to female labor in particular.

The financial report of the Board of Higher Education for the year ended June 30, 1949, is an interesting document, and especially worthy of attention now in connection with the nationwide studies under way for sounder financing of higher education. A considerable broadening of the base of support of the city's four colleges is noted.
Enrollments at the American colleges and universities are still increasing, according to reports from all sections of the country. This fall there are 1,862,465 men and women attending the nation's 790 liberal arts institutions, compared with 1,822,037 a year ago -- a gain of 2 per cent.

In mid-July, 1946, Governor Dewey appointed a thirty-member commission to study the need for a state university. That commission, established by the Legislature and headed by Owen D. Young, has now reported that there is such a need. It finds that by 1960 additional four-year facilities to accommodate 30,000 full-time students may be needed in the state.

In 1933, year of the induction of the New Barbarism in Europe and of the book burnings, Dr. Alvin Johnson conceived the plan of what is known affectionately as The University in Exile. Here freedom of inquiry was restored to the banished scientists and scholars of Germany, Italy, Austria, Czecho-Slovakia, Spain.
To the visitor in London the university that bears the name of the city consists of colleges and schools scattered about the metropolis and in a sense fugitive. The University of London was founded in 1836, and admitted women to all degrees in 1878. About 8,000 students are on the rolls, but more than 20,000 "external students" present themselves for examination only.
There is a valid reason "why Negroes should be doing Ibsen, or any 'white' play." The fact that Negroes can do Ibsen is a tribute not only to the interpretative powers of the student drama group but also to the genius of Ibsen.
The State of New York has a university without either faculty or students of its own. But in its official authority it embraces all the educational agencies of the State, from the kindergarten to the university. It possesses chartered children even beyond the bounds of the Empire State: in Syria, Brazil, China and other parts of the earth.

The appeal of the University of Chicago is for an additional endowment that will permit a larger investment in its teaching and research Faculty, or, as it has been put, in "men." Chicago University has a secure footing on which to stand in making this appeal not only to its alumni but to the country at large, and especially to the Middle West.
Co-education has been accepted as a natural method of training in our State universities and in many of our colleges, especially beyond the Alleghanics, where separate provision for young men and women was in the early days impracticable.

The National War Labor Board is at last coming to recognize that such phrases as "substandard" wages and "inequalities" in wages need precise limitation if they are not to become loopholes so large as to destroy any wage stabilization formula. The Board recently adopted a "short-cut method" and a series of "simple yardsticks" to speed up the handling of voluntary requests for wage and salary changes before the Regional War Labor Boards.
Sidney Hillman has called for a 20 per cent increase in wages and for a continuation of price control. This wage increase would be designed to offset the decline in weekly earnings of labor resulting from the reduction of overtime and the gradual elimination of other wartime factors contributing to the pay envelope.
By his telegram to the shipyard's wage negotiators, the President has shown that he is in earnest about his "anti-inflation" program. Part of the nation's shipyard workers have union contracts which provide for periodic adjustments in wages on the basis of rises in living costs.
Reports that are permitted to come out of the War Labor Board indicate that the Administration is preparing another of those little melodramas in which a labor union is "defeated' by getting substantially what it wants, while the Administration once more enacts the role of "combating inflation" at the same time as it actually adds fuel to the fire.
For some time the representatives of the railroads and of railway labor conferred on the question of a "dismissal wage." The conferences eventually reached a deadlock. The difference was over the amount of compensation to be paid to workers who are displaced as a result of railway consolidations.
There are several ways of measuring the relative welfare of labor at different periods. One is by a comparison of the number of unemployed or employed, another by a comparison of hourly wage rates, a third by average weekly wages and a fourth by total payrolls.
In a letter in today's TIMES Mr. VICTOR MORAWETZ suggests the substitution of an earned wage for the "living wage," the "saving wage," the standard wage and the rest. His argument is that wages must be proportioned to production.
One trouble with those phrases "a living wage," "a saving wage" and "an American wage" is that, as currently used, they beg the question.
With the spirit of Secretary DAVIS'S article, published on another page, no humane mind can disagree. President HARDING has expressed the idea: "The "workman's lowest wage must be enough "for comfort; enough to make his house "a home; enough to insure that the ...
The guaranteed annual wage promises to be an important issue in wage negotiations next winter and spring. Packinghouse workers and steel workers already have announced their intention to seek such a guaranteed wage.
Leon Henderson, the Price Administrator, is to be congratulated on his politically courageous statement yesterday to the National War Labor Board advising that body to rule against general, "substantial" wage increase demands by union labor, because of their inflationary influence.
Amid the intricacies of the War Labor Board's reasoning, let us keep our eye on the main point. The Board, under a strike threat, has granted Mr. Lewis' miners an increase of wages. Whatever its disavowals may be, it has once more found excuses to break its own announced "Little Steel" formula.
The CIO Executive Board has called for an immediate labor-management conference "to the end that the demand and need for immediate wage increases may be given full and official recognition" and to provide "for a stabilized national economy."

When the general price ceiling plan was adopted in Canada two years ago provision was also made for the fixing of wages. Prices and wages were generally frozen at the level prevailing in the fall of 1941. However, two types of wage adjustments were to be permitted:
Elsewhere on this page we publish a letter from L. Metcalfe Walling, Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor, referring to this newspaper's editorial of March 27 on the proposed minimum-wage amendments.
The new wage and price regulations issued by Mr. Bowles, with their accompanying explanations, illustrate once again the contrast in the way in which the Government is "stabilizing" wages as compared with prices.

The Rules Committee of the House of Representatives now has before it the question of deciding whether privilegedstatus shall be given to the revised Wage-and-Hour Bill. This measure, unlike its predecessors, imposes a single minimum standard on the whole country regardless of sectional consequences.
The hearings before the Railroad Fact-Finding Board have been concluded. The board must now, before Oct. 27, send a report to the President presenting the facts it has ascertained and making its own recommendations.
Some time ago there appeared in THE TIMES a report from France by C.L. Sulzberger on "profit-sharing in industry" which could be and should be of the greatest interest to every American. The report describes a system operating in hundreds of French plants which if adopted here would go far toward insuring full justice for workers while safeguarding industrial interests.
New rulings exempt from the application of the Federal Wage-Hour Act additional groups of "administrative" and "professional" workers if these are receiving not less than $200 a month.
Articles by Louis Stark in this newspaper yesterday and today once more call attention to the inequities in our national wage program. Both from an administrative and an economic point of view the whole program has, in fact, become chaotic. On the one hand are the workers, mostly organized, in industrial plants.

The emergency board appointed by the President, after careful study, has recommended a settlement of the railway wage dispute which, in view of all the known facts, seems more than fair to the unions; but the leaders of the five railway brotherhoods announce that they cannot accept it.
The six-day week which Secretary Ickes has ordered in the coal mines means a 30 per cent increase in the weekly pay of the miners as compared with that for a five-day week. This means a 30 per cent increase in wages for only a 20 per cent increase in hours, and perhaps for a much smaller increase in the output of coal.

WLB withdraws exemption from wage controls of employers with 8 or less workers engaged in recapping or retreading tires in NYS and 12 NJ counties
The ostensible function of the War Labor Board is to stabilize wages as a necessary part of preventing an inflationary rise of prices. The Board belatedly adopted a formula for stabilizing wages and ever since then has been exercising its ingenuity to circumvent its own formula.
Tomorrow, in accordance with the automatic provisions in the Federal Wage-Hour Act, the national mandatory minimum wage will advance from the present level of 25 to 30 cents an hour, while basic maximum weekly hours will fall from forty-four to fortytwo.
Beginning today the standard working week under the Federal Wage-Hour Act is reduced from forty-two to forty hours. This means that all workers covered by the act--and that includes the main body of all industrial workers--must be paid "time and a half" for all hours above forty.
One of the peculiar ironies of the forty-hour week is that it did not begin until our so-called all-out production program got under way. The Wage Hour Act became law on June 25, 1938. Its hour provisions did not go into effect until 120 days after its passage. For the first year of their effectiveness they set up a basic working week of forty-four hours.
The financial reports of the country's railroads for the first three months of the present year do not make pleasant reading. The net railway operating income of the Class I railroads has dropped from $148,000,000 in January, February and March a year ago to $19,000,000 this year.
The action of the conferees on the Housing Bill in rejecting Senator Lodge's "prevailing-wage" amendment is extremely encouraging.
About 100 contractors in the men's shirt industry have closed down their factories in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, throwing an estimated number of 20,000 workers out of employment, as a result of a situation growing out of the recent Presidential order reducing hours in the industry from forty to thirty-six a week and raising wage rates 10 per cent.
In his handling of the railway labor problem the President has violated every sound administrative principle. He has failed to lay down clear rules. He has failed to delegate power clearly, and to one top agency alone. He has failed to support the administrators and agencies to whom he has delegated power.
Hopes were raised last week for an immediate end to the hard-coal strike which since May 1 has virtually brought to a standstill the production of the anthracite needed to heat Northeastern homes next winter.
When the President last week reconvened a special emergency fact-finding board to reconsider the still unadjusted dispute of the non-operating railway employes, he added one more turn to the bewildering twists and turns that his railway labor policy has involved. There have been from the beginning two possible courses of action, either of which would have been at least consistent and clear.
The General Motors two-year wage-rate agreement was properly called ingenious in your May 26 issue because, in tying wage-rate increases to a combination of consumer-price changes and secular advance, it recognizes relationships so sadly ignored or improperly considered in the major agreements growing out of similar difficulties during the past two years.
Nothing tangible came of Tuesday's White House conference between President Roosevelt, the railway managers and the railway union leaders. The intimation that the President would name a commission to study the matter and perhaps to canvass, more thoroughly than has yet been done, suggested what may be the result.
Long before the War Labor Board, as such, was created -- that is, when it was still the Defense Mediation Board -- it was pointed out repeatedly to it that it would save itself and the country an enormous amount of uncertainty and trouble if it publicly announced a definite body of principles on which its decisions would be based.
Director General MCADOO has acted with wisdom in providing for a further division of his labors in the management of all the railroads in the country. Henceforth there will be three operating districts.
The members of the Big Five Railroad Brotherhoods comprise about 350,000 workers, equal to about one-third of all railroad employes. On the basis of the pay they received last year the 30 per cent increase they have demanded would add slightly more than $200,000,000 to the operating expenses of the Class I roads.
By voting to recommit the Wagesand-Hours Bill, the House of Representatives has definitely killed all chance of the enactment of this measure at the special session and made it probable, according to our Washington dispatches, that this particular plan will be shelved indefinitely.

In reducing the wages of one of the humblest classes of railway workers, the Labor Board explains that it leaves them still above the rate in comparable employments.
The voluntary acceptance of a wage reduction by the representatives of many thousands of employes of the giant packing houses of Chicago is something unheard of before on so large a scale, and is rare on any scale.

The Labor Board has raised the wages of 5,500 railway workers $364,432 a year and also granted bet- terment of working conditions. Presumably the Brotherhood of Station Employes and Telegraphers will not protest, and may not join the other brotherhoods that are pressing for the ciftion of the Labor Board.
The Trainmen Brotherhood's Vice President, Mr. DOAK, remarks feelingly that the railway workers want "practical men put in control" of the adjustment of wage disputes as a "guarantee that men would not be "subjected to inhuman conditions of "industrial servitude such as has "been the case for more than a year."

The League for the Suppression of Mystery Films Which Conceal Vital Evidence from the Audience is hereby instructed to cast a solid vote against the Mayfair's new picture, an old-school murder mystery disguised under the flamboyant title of "Sing Sing Nights." From the league's verdict there is no appeal, not even on the ground that the picture should be spared because of its novelty. So far as the league is concerned, a mystery film is only as good as its solution. This one is bad, indeed.It seems—as the Governor remarks to the professor—there was a corpse, probably the most-thoroughly killed man in history. Shot through the head, the heart and the spine. Any one bullet would have caused instant death. And there were three men who confessed the murder. And there was an unpartisan jury which found all three guilty, and a judge who sentenced all three to die in the electric chair.The professor, with the quick perception of his kind, holds that all three cannot be guilty; that two did nothing more than fire shots into a corpse. The Governor agrees, but what to do, what to do? Out of a hat, so to speak, the criminologist pulls his lie detector and offers to use it on the three condemned men. Let each tell his story, the professor suggests, and the guilty man will be revealed. So it is.The picture, then, goes into the stories of the three murderers of Floyd Cooper, war correspondent, munitions agent and gay deceiver. Whose story is to be believed? That of Howard Trude, the Washington correspondent, whose sweetheart was stolen by Cooper? That of Robert McCaigh, the coffee planter, who lost his wife and his plantation? Or that of Sergei Krenwicz whose path was crossed by Cooper in Manchuria?There's no use worrying about it. Only the lie detector and Professor Varney know. The audience must sit back and watch and listen, and there is really nothing of vast import to be seen or heard. No "Sing Sing Nights" is not the brightest of Hollywood's gifts to Broadway, even though it has a few moments and an earnest cast.The League for the Suppression of Mystery Films Which Conceal Vital Evidence from the Audience is hereby instructed to cast a solid vote against the Mayfair's new picture, an old-school murder mystery disguised under the flamboyant title of "Sing Sing Nights."

LONDON, Friday, Feb. 27. -- Yesterday's ball game was featured in this morning papers, which publish descriptions, in terms, although familiar to the cricketer, are scarcely recognizable by baseball fans. They make lengthy comparisons of cricket and baseball, and the general opinion is that, although baseball is interesting as a novelty in the matter of athletic games, it is interior to cricket and is not likely to compete with the latter game on this side.
-- The wheel, as a complete whole, compared with a railroad car, makes an interesting comparison, says The Wheel, and it must be understood that the railroad car is designed to carry its loads over almost perfect rails, while the bicycle must have all sorts of strains over rutty roads. What the mechanic calls the "factor of strength" is the point in this comparison.

Since the earliest days of the motor car automobilists have been slaves of the starting crank. It has long been felt that if only the tedious and dangerous preliminary "cranking" could be done away with, automobiling development would have made a long step toward the ideal; but, though thousands of experiments have been made, it was not until quite recently that the devices employed could really be considered certain or practical.

Editorial says success of North is due to its technical superiorityWhen it was found, upon the outbreak of the rebellion, that the traitor FLOYD, as Secretary of War, had, in view, of the event, almost completely stripped us of arms and present means of defence or aggression, we predicted that in one short year the inventive genius of the North would devise new ones so superior to the old that the latter would be comparatively worthless in the hands of the rebels, and utterly unable to contend with our new instruments of war. Never was a predictionmore truly fulfilled. Not only are our new creations overwhelming the South, but they constitute for the whole world an era in modern warfare as important as that which followed the invention of gunpowder. The little Monitor, which hardly shows her deck above the water's edge, and which carries but two guns, is, according to English authority, the most powerful and destructive vessel afloat. Assuming that she could not be made fast to, and perhaps captured in this way, she might bid defiance to all the wooden ships composing the British navy. A well-directed shot from one of her guns would send the largest of them to the bottom, while her iron plates would be impenetrable to any metal they could, as now armed, throw. The fight in Hampton Roads has been echoed around the world, and dates the commencement of an entirely new system of naval warfare and fortifications. All nations, as far as their previous armaments, preparations for defence, and naval forces, are concerned, are instantly reduced to a common level. All are equally impotent or equally powerful. Past supremacy and prestige go for nothing; while these in future are again to be contended for, unless by general consent nations, as they must sooner or later at a similar crisis, consent to treat each other as friends, instead of enemies bent on mutual destruction through modes so terrible and expensive that even the successful party may sink under the incredible burden imposed.

IT IS a pity that that great German actor Emil Jannings should have been caught napping and permitted himself to appear in such a tawdry, vulgar and strained story as that told in "The Street of Sin," now on view at the Rialto Theatre. Mr. Jannings has contributed a number of excellent performances to the screen and until this present offering he has not been seen in any picture that did not possess considerable merit. He was splendid as Louis XV in "Du Barry," known over here as "Passion"; his interpretation of the old porter in "The Last Laugh" was an achievement; his characterization of Peter the Great was powerful; his portrait of the bank clerk of German origin in "The Way of All Flesh" possessed no end of imagination; he was fine as Stephen Huller in "Variety." Then, in his previous picture, "The Last Command," he not only gave a most forceful performance but he lent to the rôle of the Russian General the traits of a fallen aristocrat, both in expression and gesture.In "The Street of Sin" Mr. Jannings is for the first time out of his element, for evidently his knowledge of London's underworld is limited. As Basher Bill he endeavors to live up to the coarseness of this artificial yarn, which strikes one as having been inspired by Thomas Burke's "Limehouse Nights." The strength of Mr. Burke's short stories was in his remarkably faithful description of the persons and of the district. He even studied the spelling of the pronunciation of the dark characters of Limehouse. "The Street of Sin," which is accompanied by some of Albert Chevalier's old costermonger songs and "Old Chinatown," from the first Charlot Revue, was said some time ago to be a story of Soho, but on the screen the district of London remains unnamed. It does not bring to mind any spot of the English metropolis any more than Basher Bill rings true as an English type. Aside from his actions, Mr. Jannings is too well shaven to look like a cockney crook. A mustache might have helped matters and also a soft pedal on some of the actions; not that London's burglars are any better than the burglars of any other country, but one might spend many a sleepless night in the dives and dens of Limehouse, Lambeth, White-chapel or Soho without ever seeing a suggestion of any of the incidents depicted in this picture.Even to those who may not appreciate the weaknesses of the characterizations and the inaccuracy of the atmospheric effects the story itself is none too inviting. It is a lumbering affair that might have been told in one reel instead of six. There is a Salvation Army lassie, impersonated by the charming Fay Wray, who is hardly the type of girl that would be sent with one timid and frail man on a mission to such a district. She is a theatrical Salvation Army girl who has not missed an opportunity to make herself attractive. The beauty of this young woman causes the renowned Basher Bill for the time being to renounce his pals and help in the Salvation Army shelter. He is so infatuated with Elizabeth, the gentle Salvation Army worker, that he deserts the frowsy Annie, with whom he has been living.Mauritz Stiller, who looks at London through Swedish glasses, fancies that piles of bank-notes are to be found on Hampstead Heath or not far from it. There is a burglary there and the malefactors come away with a wad of money. Mr. Stiller does not trouble to show the burglars traveling from their retreat, where-ever it is, to Hampstead, which would probably make one of the most interesting stretches in the picture. Neither does he give the slightest idea how they return to their hangout. They flit in this film to Hampstead and then, after a fade-out, come back to count up the haul.To show his strength, and Mr. Jannings is exceptionally powerful, Basher Bill holds arm high the Salvation Army man, the poor chap not being permitted to struggle while he is in Basher Bill's clutches. It is in this same "pub" that Elizabeth goes around soliciting money with her tambourine, and Mr. Stiller decides to have some of the disgusting crew expectorate in the instrument while another man gives this attractive girl the remnants of his cigar.Mr. Jannings's acting is sometimes as forced as the chronicle. He is fierce and forbidding, cruel and coarse, and the character always seemed strained.A Distressing Chronicle.In "Dawn," a British production, Sybil Thorndike, one of the really fine artists of the English theatre, gives a sterling and disgnified impersonation of Edith Cavell. The picture itself is quite cleverly produced; in fact, it is easily the outstanding achievement to come from Great Britain, sad and painful chronicle though it is. It is a film that ends with a flash of Miss Cavell's grave, and the suggestion of the shooting of Miss Cavell (the actual scene has been excluded) is another of the depressing incidents.This picture begins with glimpses of Miss Cavell's hospital in Brussels. The actual scenes are shown in some instances, the exteriors having been filmed in the Belgian capital. Some of it is done extraordinarily well, although there are times when the settings appear to be cramped, especially in those passages depicting the fugitives awaiting a chance to steal away with the assistance of Nurse Cavell and Mme. Bodard and Mme. Rappard.Mr. Wilcox tells his gruesome story with proper suspense and he depicts adroitly the dread of discovery. Except for a few instances, he portrays the Germans in sensible, restrained fashion, some of them being filled with sympathy for Miss Cavell. But although this film holds the attention it is a grim, disheartening echo of the war. And it should be remembered that Miss Cavell's last words were:"Patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness for any one."In a letter regarding this picture, Lord Birkenhead wrote:"Does any one suppose that the woman who, at the very moment of her agony, could speak like this [referring to her last utterance] would permit her death to be commercialized, with the certain result that the bitter memories associated with it would be kept alive and fertilized so as to prevent the sweet restoration of friendship and good relationship between the nations of the world?"A Mechanical Story.WITH all its possibilities for a picture, Herbert Brenon has fashioned from "Laugh, Clewn, Laugh!", the play by David Belasco and Tom Cushing, nothing more than an unimaginative series of scenes, which, although some of them are effective units, leave one cold. It has neither heart nor soul and there are quite a number of absurdly extravagant sequences.In one episode the girl, Simonetta, whom the clown, Tito Beppi, has rescued as a waif, hurts her leg. The young waster, Count Luigi Ravelli, discovers Simonetta and, filled with compassion for her evidently slight injury, he carries her into his palatial house. He does not stop in the drawing room, or the library, but goes all the way to his own room, where, after he has bandaged the injury, he imprints kisses on Simonetta's pretty foot.The dinner party in another scene is a thoroughly moviesque affair, but even such ideas would be pardonable if the action of the drama were more human. The old, old story of Grimaldi comes forth as if it were thought by the producer to be something new, and Nils Asther's portrayal in one chapter of the giggling nobleman is by no means effective. Luigi, through wine and women, is supposed to be in a highly nervous condition and Tito, played by Lon Chaney, has lost his grip on life so that he sobs. They, the laughing count and the tearful clown, go to the same nerve specialist and both are recommended the same prescription—a wholesome love. Simonetta, so it happens, is the girl with whom the young nobleman and the middle-aged clown are infatuated.Rajah Menjou.A LITTLE levity fell on Broadway last week in the shape of "The Tiger Lady," wherein the dependable Adolphe Menjou plays an exceedingly amusing part, that of a stage super, named Henri, who falls head over heels in love with the imperious creature who reigns over the show. The background is Paris and the story is farcical, but nevertheless quite intriguing It has moments that are delightful, especially an episode where this super, arrayed in his glittering Rajah's stage costume, invades a restaurant with all the aplomb of an Eastern potentate. He must have a certain table (because it is near the one at which are seated the Tiger Lady and her entourage of a Duke, a Marquis and a Count) and insists that a regular patron of the restaurant, now busy refreshing the inner man, shall resign in favor of himself. Once the man has been prevailed upon to move, Henri, looking like the wealthiest of Rajahs, languidly takes his place. He is a pale Hindu, but that does not influence the Tiger Lady against him. She is, in fact, so interested in this begemmed and turbaned knight of a torrid land that she, after a look or two, goes over to the Rajah's table. Soon her escort joins her and all are impressed by the Rajah's in-difference to everything, except the Tiger Lady.When the waiter hazards offering the Rajah the check, a mere matter of 19,587 francs, the Rajah does not quite conceal the shock. But the Duke, the Marquis and the Count are so eager to foot the bill that the good-natured (for the nonce) Rajah decides that they shall be delighted and forthwith hands them the disturbing piece of paper. He then decamps with the placidly beautiful Tiger Lady, who in the privacy of her apartment confides to Henri, as the Rajah, that what she admires most in a man is courage. Offhand, she says that she tests her suitors by seeing whether they are brave enough to enter a tiger's cage and rescue her immaculate gloves.It is a new angle on Francis R. Stockton's classic, "The Lady or the Tiger."Mr. Menjou is admirable as the masquerading super. Evelyn Brent is stunning as the Tiger Lady.IT IS a pity that that great German actor Emil Jannings should have been caught napping and permitted himself to appear in such a tawdry, vulgar and strained story as that told in "The Street of Sin," now on view at the Rialto Theatre. Mr. Jannings has contributed a number of excellent performances to the screen and until this present offering he has not been seen in any picture that did not possess considerable merit. He was splendid as Louis XV in "Du Barry," known over here as "Passion"; his interpretation of the old porter in "The Last Laugh" was an achievement; his characterization of Peter the Great was powerful; his portrait of the bank clerk of German origin in "The Way of All Flesh" possessed no end of imagination; he was fine as Stephen Huller in "Variety." Then, in his previous picture, "The Last Command," he not only gave a most forceful performance but he lent to the rôle of the Russian General the traits of a fallen aristocrat, both in expression and gesture.In "The Street of Sin" Mr. Jannings is for the first time out of his element, for evidently his knowledge of London's underworld is limited. As Basher Bill he endeavors to live up to the coarseness of this artificial yarn, which strikes one as having been inspired by Thomas Burke's "Limehouse Nights." The strength of Mr. Burke's short stories was in his remarkably faithful description of the persons and of the district. He even studied the spelling of the pronunciation of the dark characters of Limehouse. "The Street of Sin," which is accompanied by some of Albert Chevalier's old costermonger songs and "Old Chinatown," from the first Charlot Revue, was said some time ago to be a story of Soho, but on the screen the district of London remains unnamed. It does not bring to mind any spot of the English metropolis any more than Basher Bill rings true as an English type. Aside from his actions, Mr. Jannings is too well shaven to look like a cockney crook. A mustache might have helped matters and also a soft pedal on some of the actions; not that London's burglars are any better than the burglars of any other country, but one might spend many a sleepless night in the dives and dens of Limehouse, Lambeth, White-chapel or Soho without ever seeing a suggestion of any of the incidents depicted in this picture.Even to those who may not appreciate the weaknesses of the characterizations and the inaccuracy of the atmospheric effects the story itself is none too inviting. It is a lumbering affair that might have been told in one reel instead of six. There is a Salvation Army lassie, impersonated by the charming Fay Wray, who is hardly the type of girl that would be sent with one timid and frail man on a mission to such a district. She is a theatrical Salvation Army girl who has not missed an opportunity to make herself attractive. The beauty of this young woman causes the renowned Basher Bill for the time being to renounce his pals and help in the Salvation Army shelter. He is so infatuated with Elizabeth, the gentle Salvation Army worker, that he deserts the frowsy Annie, with whom he has been living.Mauritz Stiller, who looks at London through Swedish glasses, fancies that piles of bank-notes are to be found on Hampstead Heath or not far from it. There is a burglary there and the malefactors come away with a wad of money. Mr. Stiller does not trouble to show the burglars traveling from their retreat, where-ever it is, to Hampstead, which would probably make one of the most interesting stretches in the picture. Neither does he give the slightest idea how they return to their hangout. They flit in this film to Hampstead and then, after a fade-out, come back to count up the haul.To show his strength, and Mr. Jannings is exceptionally powerful, Basher Bill holds arm high the Salvation Army man, the poor chap not being permitted to struggle while he is in Basher Bill's clutches. It is in this same "pub" that Elizabeth goes around soliciting money with her tambourine, and Mr. Stiller decides to have some of the disgusting crew expectorate in the instrument while another man gives this attractive girl the remnants of his cigar.Mr. Jannings's acting is sometimes as forced as the chronicle. He is fierce and forbidding, cruel and coarse, and the character always seemed strained.A Distressing Chronicle.In "Dawn," a British production, Sybil Thorndike, one of the really fine artists of the English theatre, gives a sterling and disgnified impersonation of Edith Cavell. The picture itself is quite cleverly produced; in fact, it is easily the outstanding achievement to come from Great Britain, sad and painful chronicle though it is. It is a film that ends with a flash of Miss Cavell's grave, and the suggestion of the shooting of Miss Cavell (the actual scene has been excluded) is another of the depressing incidents.This picture begins with glimpses of Miss Cavell's hospital in Brussels. The actual scenes are shown in some instances, the exteriors having been filmed in the Belgian capital. Some of it is done extraordinarily well, although there are times when the settings appear to be cramped, especially in those passages depicting the fugitives awaiting a chance to steal away with the assistance of Nurse Cavell and Mme. Bodard and Mme. Rappard.Mr. Wilcox tells his gruesome story with proper suspense and he depicts adroitly the dread of discovery.

Comparative actions of brains and of the human and animal bodies actuated by them are pictured in the Russian film, "Mechanics of the Brain," which was shown last night for the first time in this country at a private meeting of the New York Society of Clinical Psychiatry at the Academy of Medicine, Fifth Avenue and 103d Street. The film tends to show that the brain of the dog, frog, hippopotamus or ape as well as that of the child or adult all operate on exactly the same principles. It is the result of experiments during the last twenty-eight years in the laboratory of Professor Ivan Paviov, who received the Nobel Prize for his work with the so-called "conditioned reflex.""Human beings learn such processes as eating in exactly the same way that animals must learn these processes," said Dr. Howard Scott Liddell, Professor of Physiology in Cornell University, in his talk accompanying the film. "An animal could build up in time eating rituals as complicated as those of human beings if it were not for the limitations imposed by the smaller capacity of the animal cortex."Subjects Considered Machines.The film, surveying animal and human behavior, pictures the mechanisms which are necessary for simple as well as complicated types of behavior, so that both the animal and the human being are considered as machines. Pavlov dismantles these machines to show how they are constructed."The result of this mechanical view of behavior is that all behavior can be analyzed into reflexes, a re-flex being the response of the animal to a change of environment which involves the nervous system," Professor Liddell explained. "According to Pavlov, the reflex is a mechanism because it always occurs with machinelike regularity whenever conditions remain the same. So-called spontaneous or voluntary activities of animals or man seem to be capricious and not reducible to mechanical conditions."When, however, proper precautions are taken spontaneity or capriciousness disappears, and by careful analysis and experiment even the most complicated behavior can be shown to occur invariably according to laws which can be formulated definitely."Elaborate experiments with dogs, cows, frogs and apes, as well as children and adults, were shown to support this theory.Ape and Baby Compared.One experiment compares the ways in which an ape and a baby learn to associate environment with food, fear and play, tending to show there is no essential difference. When a red ball is shown to the ape, the animal immediately drops whatever it is doing and runs for food. It shows no reaction when the experiment is repeated with a blue ball.A dog is shown which had learned to associate 78 vibrations on the metronome with food, but reminds unaffected when the number of vibrations is 200. In the same way, an elephant received a coin with his trunk and, having learned to associate it with food, immediately takes it to the keeper and exchanges it for meat and potatoes.The first and only public showing of the film in New York City will be held on March 19 at the Engineers Club in connection with a lecture explaining the work of Pavlov. It will be under the auspices of the New School for Social Research and the American Society for Cultural Relations with Russia.Comparative actions of brains and of the human and animal bodies actuated by them are pictured in the Russian film, "Mechanics of the Brain," which was shown last night for the first time in this country at a private meeting of the New York Society of Clinical Psychiatry at the Academy of Medicine, Fifth Avenue and 103d Street.

The Sixth Annual Fair of the New-Jersey State Agricultural Society, at Elizabeth City, closed yesterday. It has been a very successful and a very creditable exhibition. The weather has been propitious, the attendance has been very large, and the visitors declare that the display was the finest that the Society has yet put forth. There were fewer extraneous features of an unpleasant nature about it than are usuallyobservable at gatherings of the kind. Excellent order was maintained, not only within the ground, but, within a certain limit, without. By a special enactment of the Legislature of the State, the Society is given exclusive jurisdiction over the territory immediately surrounding the inclosure in which its fairs are held. The Police of Elizabeth City on this occasion watched over the public peace. The gamblers, who took up their quarters, near the entrance on the first day, were speedily put to flight, and a few drunken men who became nuisances were summarily disposed of. The track on which the horses were put through their paces was kept clear, and riotous customers were under constant surveillance. On Thursday probably 20,000 persons visited the Exhibition. The plowing match, the equestrianism and the trotting were the features of that day.

MOSCOW, Oct. 13 -- Having captured part of one street in a Stalingrad factory district last evening, the Germans mounted another attack against the factory today, but failed to gain and lost two companies in the attempt. The last two days' fighting, after a brief lull, seems to make it clear that the enemy is continuing his attacks, which if not so heavy as last week's, are aimed at the same objective.

"Russia, today, the Land Nobody Knows," is the beguiling title of a film at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse this week. This series of scenes in various sections of the Soviet Republic was produced by the American Student Delegation on their visit to Russia last Summer. It was actually filmed by Benjamin Leader, Secretary of the Ship News Reporters' Association, and Hillman Bishop, who headed the delegation.This picture is not as informative as one would gather from its title. There are views of the populace in different towns and also flashes of factories and people working in the wheat fields. In some cases the Russians appears to be laboring in a primitive fashion while in others they have adopted labor-saving devices. One episode is devoted to the anger caused by Britain severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet, and a caption calls attention to the "seething excitement" in a certain community; it is not especially seething.There were a few persons in the audience yesterday afternoon who could not resist applauding. In fact, one man clapped when he beheld a potato-peeling machine, and he was most enthustiastic when he saw a glimpse of a small boat and the making of a boiler.It is set forth in the text that the most impressive sight that met the eyes of the students was a funeral in Moscow, which is depicted on the screen.This feature is prefaced by a short subject entitled "When Lenine Died," which is quite interesting. To balance this offering there is Ernst Lubitsch's excellent old film. "Forbidden Paradise," the theme of which was, incidentally, inspired by Catherine of Russia."Russia, today, the Land Nobody Knows," is the beguiling title of a film at the Fifth Avenue Playhouse this week. This series of scenes in various sections of the Soviet Republic was produced by the American Student Delegation on their visit to Russia last Summer. It was actually filmed by Benjamin Leader, Secretary of the Ship News Reporters' Association, and Hillman Bishop, who headed the delegation.This picture is not as informative as one would gather from its title. There are views of the populace in different towns and also flashes of factories and people working in the wheat fields. In some cases the Russians appears to be laboring in a primitive fashion while in others they have adopted labor-saving devices. One episode is devoted to the anger caused by Britain severing diplomatic relations with the Soviet, and a caption calls attention to the "seething excitement" in a certain community; it is not especially seething.There were a few persons in the audience yesterday afternoon who could not resist applauding. In fact, one man clapped when he beheld a potato-peeling machine, and he was most enthustiastic when he saw a glimpse of a small boat and the making of a boiler.It is set forth in the text that the most impressive sight that met the eyes of the students was a funeral in Moscow, which is depicted on the screen.This feature is prefaced by a short subject entitled "When Lenine Died," which is quite interesting.

With the arrival from Russia of "Men and Jobs" ("Dela I Lyudi") at the Cameo, American film patrons have an excellent opportunity to see how Soviet enthusiasm, combined with American technical ability and tools, finished the gigantic Dnieprostoy dam two months ahead of schedule and made it the outstanding success of the famous Five-Year Plan. They also have a chance to witness a "glorification" of the machine, in the shape of a steam-driven crane. There is some first-rate acting by N. Okhlopkof, as leader of the "shock brigade" of cement pourers; V. Stanitsyn, as the American engineer who shows the green Russian workers how it ought to be done, and S. Polyakof, as the worker who becomes an "Americanized" crane operator.This picture, which graphically depicts the industrialization of the Russian proletariat and no doubt is of great educational and propaganda value at home, is well photographed and directed and the sound reproduction is good. Unfortunately, however, the speeding-up process by which the Russian "shock brigade" finally overtakes and surpasses the record set by the gang headed by the American specialist is indicated mainly by diagrams instead of by actual scenes. A mild romance between a rather attractive girl interpreter and the Russian instructing engineer does not interfere with the main action. There is more humor in "Men and Jobs" than is usual in Soviet productions. As the American engineer speaks English throughout and there are plenty of captions in that language, no knowledge of Russian is needed for enjoyment of the picture.MUSIC NOTES.Sir Hamilton Harty, conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra and the Halle Orchestra of Manchester, England, is expected to arrive today on the Mauretania. He will conduct two pairs of concerts with the Cleveland Orchestra this week and the week following in Cleveland, Ohio. He conducted in San Francisco and at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles during the Summers of 1931 and 1932.Guido Napoli has announced his resignation from the New York Opera Guild.With the arrival from Russia of "Men and Jobs" ("Dela I Lyudi") at the Cameo, American film patrons have an excellent opportunity to see how Soviet enthusiasm, combined with American technical ability and tools, finished the gigantic Dnieprostoy dam two months ahead of schedule and made it the outstanding success of the famous Five-Year Plan.

To the Editor of The New York Times: Is not Mr. Elwell's letter of Sept. 12 touching on "Individuality in Art" at the present moment just a little over-anxious?
THE recent decisions of the Columbia and RCA Victor recording companies to go their separate ways in disk design and turntable speed have put the other people who manufacture phonographs on the spot. The following is intended to give a general idea of what you may find if you look for a new machine able to play all the different types.
The index of machine tool orders again recorded an increase in July, rising to 89.6 from 70.2 in June, according to figures issued today by the National Machine Tool Builders Association. The index for July, 1937, stood at 170.1.
With the arrival of "Pozor" ("Shame"), a Russian dialogue film with English titles, at the Cameo, Americans receive a chance to see a remarkably well made picture and to learn that the word "shame" in the Soviet Union has little to do with sex, but is used freely to hold incompetent or unwilling workers up to the scorn of their fellows. Furthermore, the Russian directors have managed to put a deal of romance into the rather technical subject of how best to turn out the huge steam-electric turbines so much in demand over there.The main theme of the picture is devoted to efforts of Pavel (D. Abrikosof), Lazaref (M. Kozlovsky), engineers; Vasya (Boris Tenin), secretary of the Communist shop group, and Tchutkotchkin (G. Gudkin), a student engineer, to improve the functioning of the plant, despite stealthy acts of sabotage by Engineer Skortsof (B. Poslavsky), a hold-over from the old régime who occupies an important position. The student finally discovers the failure of some of the key machinery to work properly to be due to Engineer Skortsof's "carlessness" in allowing a mistake of three-hundreths of a millimeter to be made in changing the British blue-prints from inches to the metric system.But before the satisfactory ending is reached and the big, new turbine proves its worth, there are all sorts of complications, involving the wrongful branding with "shame" of Babtchenko (Vladimir Gardin), an old-time skilled mechanic, who has a fondness for books and is scornful of the new shop ways. The acting of Gardin and his general appearance remind one of Emil Jannings. His excellent work is one of the high spots of the picture. The other members of the cast also are first-class performers. The limited mass scenes are effective, especially where the workers with bated breath watch while the new turbine is being tried out.A slight concession is made to the love interest by having the personable Katya (Tamara Guretskaya) temporarily separated from Pavel, her young husband, through disagreements over the turbine puzzle, but happily reunited with him at the end, somewhat to the disappointment of Vasya. The photography and the sound reproduction are excellent.With the arrival of "Pozor" ("Shame"), a Russian dialogue film with English titles, at the Cameo, Americans receive a chance to see a remarkably well made picture and to learn that the word "shame" in the Soviet Union has little to do with sex, but is used freely to hold incompetent or unwilling workers up to the scorn of their fellows.

Our uncrowned King, on his return to his adopted country, a few days ago, commenting upon the benefits of ring politics, as exemplified by our present city administration, attempted to impress upon the impressionable the necessity of machine rule, telling us, with somewhat brazen effrontery, that we must be governed like the girls of the department store or the employes of the manufactory.
NOW the fun will be in seeing how much money the New York racing public will roll  through the mutuel machines in the turf season just ahead. It will be plenty, even though it may not bring home the State tax return of $10,000,000 blithely estimated by Senator John J. Dunnigan when he set out to steer the bill through the Albany legislative machine.
The Republican machine's discovery that Gov. HUGHES is not at all strong with the people and cannot be renominated was remarkably sudden, and the evidence with which it supports that contention is surprising in its nature and variety. The most convincing proof of the Governor's unavailability is undoubtedly the testimony of Mr. FRANCIS HENDRICKS as to conditions in his home county.

Again we have free coinage of silver assuming the guise of something sacred. It is an old phenomenon or affliction. There are, of course, many disinterested and intelligent advocates of bimetalism in some form or other.

A Roman Catholic protest against the public performance of a play in which the Founder of Christianity appears in person does not excite wonder. To be sure, the Church first schooled the multitudes in the traditions and symbols of the religion by means of the miracle and mystery plays, and some of these, though they were made to serve their purpose, were coarse and even indecent, according to modern Ideas.

THAT Russia is going through a period of religious revival is the opinion expressed by Boris Sokolov, a Socialist-Revolutionist, in an article in a Russian radical paper printed at Paris. To him it is an indication of the victory of Christianity over Bolshevism.

The appeal of the Japanese "Religious Association" for a public subscription to restore the Christian churches and schools wrecked by a Japanese mob is one of the most curious and characteristic of recent Japanese events.

E.P. Dutton  Co. have nearly ready for publication "Pro Fide: A Defense of Natural and Revealed Religion," by Charles Harris, B.D., examining chaplain to the Bishop of Llandaff. The volume has been written for three classes of readers:
One purpose of "The Religion of the Universe," the new book by J. Allanson Picton, M.A., author of "New Theories and the Old Faith," "The Mystery of Matter," "The Religion of Jesus," , is to show that the issues between religion and science have no definite finality, as set forth by Herbert Spencer in his "First Principles."
For any one to doubt the sincerity of Mr. E. Kay Robinson of England would be to do him a gross injustice. Yet one might very well question the propriety of his attitude as a critic of his own work; and, by thus finding fault with him, still commit no offense.

As an American citizen, and the son of a citizen, I thank you for your editorial in reply to Father Chadwick.
To the Editor of The New York Times: The Rev. Dr. R.S. MacArthur in Monday's TIMES is reported as saying: "The man who cannot put his religion in his politics must have very bad politics or very poor religion."
To the Editor of The New York Times: I think it was Thomas Carlyle who said, "Religion can no more be taught to men than it can be inherited by them." I am led to quote this anent the letters which have appeared in THE TIMES touching the teaching of religion in the common schools. Was not Carlyle right when he said what I have quoted?
WIDELY known as a writer and lecturer upon the religions of the world and upon the ethical and spiritual needs of life, Dr. Martin brings to the study he makes in this little book a reputation for scholarship and for profound conviction as to the value and necessity of high moral standards and goals that gives its survey an increased value.

To the Editor of The New York Times: The movement of Roman Catholics to secure a system of education which shall not entirely ignore religion is a movement in the right direction. And their self-sacrificing effort in maintaining their parochial schools for this purpose ought to cause Protestants to blush, when it is compared with their own indifference in this matter.
I read in one of your recent issues a report of Col. Ingersoll's lecture on "Superstition." May I rid myself of a few reflections thereon, for the lecture raises many questions which will not down? What are the conditions of the Church that it invites the bitter attacks not only of the doughty Colonel, but also of even greater philosophers than he?
To the Editor of The New York Times: It is quite unnecessary that religion should be the foundation of the teaching of morality, as held by "Inquirer"; on the contrary, it is impossible to deduce the highest moral teachings from such standards.
The gentle reader of THE TIMES, E.N.P., who objects to religion as conducted with "soft lights and music" and "words, words, words," neglects to explain what she would like to put in the place of the sacred drama. She tells us (I say "she," for the letter is fraught with feminine delicacy) that she believes in the eternal verities such as the divinity of Christ.
Amer Educ Fellowship speakers urge religious instruction in pub schools rather than sectarian instruction on released time
Well cured cod, to be sure, is not to be disdained by any one; nevertheless by far the larger part of it is eaten by Catholics. It is the fresh cod of our inland fisheries that has supplied most of our markets, while the salted cod of the banks is chief sold either in Catholic countries or in lands where that religious element is large.
In the able review of Georges Brandes's late work on William Shakespeare in THE TIMES'S SATURDAY REVIEW a few weeks ago I notice this extract on Bishop Charles Wordsworth's "Knowledge and Use of the Bible": "A highly esteemed, very pious, but, I regret to say, quite unreadable work."
We find a brilliant mathematician, Prof. Clifford, launching invectives which, if they were just, would prove either that no religion at all has any right to mankind's regard, or that the Christian religion, at all events, has none. He calls Christianity "that awful plague which has destroyed two civilizations, and but barely failed to slay such promise of good as is now struggling to live amongst men."
Statistics show that next after fiction and history and biography, the books most largely published, are those which treat of religion. This statement refers only to the number published. As to readers, were it possible to obtain statistics, the showing might be different. But it remains true that a larger proportion of the reading public is interested in religious books than is commonly supposed.

To the Editor of The New York Times: Among the various arguments that have been advanced against the ill-advised attempt of Gov.

To the Editor of The New York Times: Some time ago you published some quotations from an article by the Rev. Mr. McSweeny upon religion in our public schools, and a letter from some one signing himself "Protestant" on the same subject. May I ask the same favor for the few lines following?
THE volume, "The Revolutionary Function of the Modern Church," by J.H. Holmes, (G.P. Putnam,) the well-known pastor of the Church of the Messiah, is a representative contribution to a growing literature in which religion is identified with the social question and the spiritual welfare of society is regarded as bound up with civic enactments, a living wage, and the elimination of the causes of poverty and disease.
To the Editor of The New York Times: A few days ago two prominent colored men decided to visit Asbury Park and Ocean Grove for a little pleasure and recreation, never dreaming that they would be met with refusals because of their color at this great resort of American Methodists. It was a pitiful and pitiable sight, but such was the case.
To the Editor of The New York Times: In the letter of "An Inquirer," published in reply to Mr. B.'s letter on "Religion in Public Schools," the question of moral teaching as opposed to theological or socalled religious teaching is very ably touched upon. The teacher is not required to teach of or concerning God at all.
The New York Times Saturday Review of Books: The recent articles referring to the Agnosticism of Roger Williams have caused me no little surprise, from the fact that my early teaching, often confirmed by others, was that he belonged to the very orthodox Baptist denomination.
From The National Review. Every lapse in thought from the Christian standard spells degradation for multitudes. But it spells misery, too. The experiment of life, reduced to a play of molecular forces, does not correspond to the nature of things; it is a dream upon which reality is always breaking in, and the dreamer cannot sleep in peace.
I was pleased to read Mr. Felix Adler's address published in THE TIMES last Monday. It is the kind of religion that our people need and the kind that many wish for but seldom hear preached. It is suited to a large class of conscientious, earnest people who may be called Veritists -- Disciples of Truth. Their principles are embodied mainly in the following practical, ethical, and moral rules of conduct:
major clauses of new Const listed; Islam barred as state religion; inclusion of clause requiring Pres to be Moslem doubtful
THE London Times Literary Supplement is moved to print a "Defense of Rhyme." It does not clearly appear who is attacking rhyme, but it is certain that there will be fewer disposed to attack it now that The London Times has so well stated the case in its favor.
From The Jewish Chronicle. Compulsory religious education in Prussia has led to a curious result with, regard to the children of non-conformists. According to the socialistic organ, the Vorwarts, some parents have hit upon a rather peculiar expedient to relieve themselves of their difficulty.
SIR ARTHUR T. QUILLER-COUCH would not know how to write other than admirably, with vividness of description, clear-cut presentation of character and that sureness of touch which always differentiated the artist from the amateur. His latest novel, "Lady Good-For-Nothing," is in many ways well up to the standard he has set for himself; but, although it holds the reader's interest, it is laid down with some sense of disappointment.
"The Attitude of the Secular Press in America Toward Religion" was the subject considered at a meeting of the American Institute of Christian Philosophy last evening in the vestry of the Church of the Strangers. Mr. A.H. Siegfried, the eastern manager of the Chicago Daily News, presented the question from the standpoint of a newspaper man.
From Good Words. The talk turned somehow upon the life of the camp, and gradually we got to their religion. I asked them what sacrifices they made. "We sacrifice every year" -- 1 understood in our Spring. "For what?" "Minshan el mawat -- for the sake of the dead." "What good does it do the dead?"

Augustine Washington, like most scholarly Virginians of his time, was a deist. The only one of his children who appears to have been christened was George, which, may have been a concession to his second wife. According to his relative, Mrs. Throckmorton, George was prayerful in childhood, and there are two or three quotations from hymns in one of his earliest copybooks written in a childish hand.
THE author of this book is a Catholic priest and his work is the result of the labor of ten years. Moreover, the work bears the imprimatur of  so eminent a man as Cardinal Gibbons.
BASED on a series of three lectures delivered at Yale University on the Dwight Harrington Terry Foundation, this little volume offers a stimulating view of modern religion as influenced by modern science that makes of religious belief a workaday, evolving factor of life.
In your issue of the 21st inst. one T. G. Shearman, in twenty-three cantos, as it were, gives his opinion of the Republic of the Transvaal in such form that if the illiterate, ignorant rigmarole did not bespeak the writer's status, moral and mental, one would be led to think the Dutch race (our own respected founders) should never have supplanted the hottentot Kings of Southern Africa.
It seems almost beyond belief that in this age of general enlightenment great masses of supposedly intelligent people should permit themselves to be deluded in the most preposterous manner by obviously irresponsible individuals, who pose before the public in the ridiculous guise of divine healers, faith curists, Christian Scientists, and evangelists.

It may be remembered by students of Church history, as an incident in a controversy of winder import between Mr. Gladstone and Cardinal Manning, that the former denied the Cardinal's claim of Maryland as a place where the Church of Rome had given religious toleration.

Perhaps the best and most exact picture of what was really being done in our churches in the early years of Elizabeth's reign is found in the dry, grim records of the returns, in 1566, from Lincolnshire parishes, printed in Mr. Peacock's valuable work. These returns were made to the Bishop, Archdeacon, and other royal Commissioners in reply to definite queries as to all "monumentes of supersticion" remaining since Mary's death.
TWO declarations express the breath and spirit of the new religious militant organization the Religious Citizenship League. "If the religious people get together nothing can stand in their way." writes Dr. Walter Raschenhusch, President of the league, while Dr. Stephen S.

As Rome became a residence for all strange gods, it also became both the religious capital of the world and its religious centre. It became, and was called, the "Holy City" and the "Eternal City"; and so, when Christianity ultimately triumphed, it still retained those titles, and became naturally, as well as for other reasons, regarded ad the religious capital of the Christian world.

The origin  of religion is to be sought in the countless ages before the rise of theology; before spirits, ghosts, or gods ever took definite form in the human mind.

Down-and-out sleuth falls for woman he was hired to frame.Having an ample plot to prowl in, William Powell is revealed at his most entertaining in "Private Detective 62," which found precious few dissenters at the Radio City Music Hall yesterday. Mr. Powell has a talent for furtive heroics, and it is the best of fun to watch him slipping through the shadows of criminal melodrama. As co-partner of one of the less aromatic detective agencies, he knows what unfaithful wives and suspicious husbands would give a handsome sum to find out. He can tell as lovely a lady as Margaret Lindsay how lovely she really is. Dropping the gallant manner two minutes later, he can turn on a sniffling dope addict and pry some interesting secrets out of him.Although the story has not all the raciness and zest it might have owned (and the numeral which seems so portentous in the title has somehow gotten lost in the film), "Private Detective 62" is a hearty melodrama and Mr. Powell is excellent in it. On the shady side of respectability, where the Peerless Detective Agency is quartered, life has its own color and variety. Today one is betraying a misunderstood wife in Atlantic City; tomorrow the assignment has shifted to a gambling casino in the Fifties. Simple blackmail may become murder.Donald Free, which is the name of the detective whose adventures Mr. Powell pictures, has a comparatively respectable job as under-cover man for the American diplomatic service in Paris until he is caught red-handed by the French in the act of appropriating the contents of a secret treaty. To protect itself, the American Foreign Office discredits him. Back in New York he finds jobs scarce, and he finally aligns himself with a disreputable agency which specializes in divorce cases.Janet Reynolds, beautiful, wealthy and foolish, indulges her passion for gambling in an exclusive club, and with an incredible streak of luck runs her credit up to $50,000. The proprietor hires the agency to "frame" the girl, so that she will not be able to collect the money owed her. Donald Free's partner arranges for Janet to shoot the proprietor with a gun from which the shells have been extracted, and then double-crosses the man by having him actually killed a few minutes later. The process by which Free saves the girl from a murder charge and solves the mystery of the double shooting is one which provides "Private Detective 62" with a dénouement of suspense and excitement.Miss Lindsay (she is the charming English actress who went down with the Titanic in "Cavalcade") reveals a very considerable talent and loveliness as the gambling girl. There are two other interesting performances—by Arthur Hohl as the treacherous and unscrupulous partner in the agency and by James Bell as the "snowbird" (underworld for dope addict), who is the "trigger man" (underworld for hired murderer) for the agency.

THIS IS an age of amazing critical industry and erudition. An army of able editors is busily engaged in collating the manuscripts of masterpieces with the common texts, and purging these last, as with a hyssop, of the corruptions conduced by the carelessness of earlier, more easy-going scholars.

Tait, Bishop, and Church of St. Michael; Clerical BickeringsThe London Daily News narrates, in a recent number, a singular difficulty, or rather series of difficulties, which occurred at the dedication of the Church of St. Michael and All Angels in that city. We are informed that the first cause of offence to the officiating Bishop, Dr. TAFT, was the appearance of the altar, which was decorated with four handsome bouquets, which latter he desired should be removed. Again, on the entrance of the priests of the church, who were habited in surplices with richly embroidered stoles, he is reported to have said, quietly but sternly: "The clergy of my diocese must appear in the ceremonial of to-day in the simple dress of clergymen of England." No attention being paid to this, Dr. TAIT repeated, "I must ask you to take off those ribands, gentlemen;" which request was then speedily complied with. On the stone reredos behind the communion table there was a rough sketch, in charcoal, of the crucifixion, with two figures of the saints. This also was highly objectionable, and the Bishop desired that it should be obliterated. As the operation could not be well performed at that time, the incumbent, (Rev. Mr. LYFORD,) signed a memorandum to the effect that it should certainly be erased, on which the Bishop proceeded with the ceremony of dedication.

Shakespeare Tercentenary Workmen's Meeting in Hyde Park ProhibitedThe operatives of England are the creators of the wealth of England. Without their industry she could not pay the interest of her enormous debt, could not meet the current expenses of her Government, could not maintain her present proud position among the nations. Without the support of their strong arms, her resources, her power, her prestige, would vanish as the morning mist. Yet, how are those indefatigable toilers requited for the services they render? Why, by denying them the rights of citizens and of human nature, and by manifesting, on every possible occasion, her distrust of them. Here is a case illustrative of England's mode of dealing with her moiling millions. An intelligent body of the London operatives, having resolved to celebrate SHAKESPEARE's tercentenary by marching in procession to Green Park, and there planting a young oak in honor of the great dramatist, took the liberty of sending a deputation to Downing-street, to ask permission of Mr. COWPER, Chief Commissioner of Woods and Forests, to proceed through Hyde Park to their destination. Their object had no connection whatever with politics; they merely meant to make a public demonstration of their reverence for literature, to plant in the earth the sapling, which, in its upward and outward growth for centuries, should symbolize the increasing fame of the matchless bard, and then to return home the way they came.

The Soviet Government has decided to give up the nine-story office building in New York now occupied by the Amtorg Trading Corporation and to move that representative of the Soviet foreign trade monopoly to smaller quarters of brownstone-house proportions. This move, which is, of course, in keeping with the Kremlin's estimate of the general world situation, foreshadows a further shrinkage in trade between the United States and the Soviet Union, already reduced to a trickle.

The Department of Commerce describes its report on the country's foreign trade in May as reflecting "the slowing-up in foreign demand for United States merchandise, which has been in evidence for several months." This would be no surprising result, in view of the moderate trade reaction abroad. All of the decrease in our
Until more is known about the probable direction of the negotiations between representatives of the British and German Governments regarding an agreement on foreign trade relations, no clear judgment will be possible. But it is not too early to point out that unless the German representatives show a willingness to move toward a general reduction of world trade barriers, no agreement reached is likely to promote world economic stability.

While the German Government, according to Washington reports, has been sounding out the State Department with regard to a reciprocal trade treaty, its advances have been meeting with rebuffs. That Washington should be cool toward such an agreement with Germany just now is intelligible, either because of Germany's defiance of world opinion or of its refusal to make even the moderate payments called for on the Young and Dawes bonds.
Some of the reasons for the extraordinary decline in international trade since 1929 are evident. Business activity has slowed down. Purchasing power in all countries has been reduced. A sharp fall has taken place in the level of prices and accordingly in the value of goods moved across national frontiers.
As a means of promoting recovery in Cuba, the Roosevelt Administration is considering negotiation of a reciprocal trade agreement with that country. American markets are essential to Cuban producers.

American foreign trade is declining from a ruinous prosperity to a profit which recently would have been thought gratifying. May exports were $330,000,000, against $745,000,000 last year. Imports were $208,000,000, against $451,000,000. Yet the world was left owing us $122,000,000.

The trade reviews of the week agree that the continued labor unsettlement in the coal mining industry has served to check business. Holiday buying is reported to be in evidence, and shortages in many lines are apparent. Dun's Review says:
The fact that, measured by dollar value, our foreign trade in merchandise during 1937, as reported last week by the Commerce Department, should have surpassed all annual records since 1930 was not surprising. The course of prices has been such that, notwithstanding the decline since midsummer, the average for 1937 has been much the highest in six years.

The trade reviews of the week just passed do not agree completely on general business conditions. Dun's Review says that there has been a reversal of sentiment, and that recessions in important lines have been in evidence due to labor unrest, price agitation, and the political situation.

Activity in the grain pits on the Board of Trade here last week was much larger than in the preceding week, but was still much smaller than a year ago. Interest centered mainly in wheat, but the corn trade broadened considerably, especially late in the week when there was free buying of the December delivery on unfavorable weather over the Corn Belt.
A year ago the rapidly mounting balance against the United States in its foreign trade was causing much perplexity. During the four first months of 1937 merchandise imports exceeded exports by $132,600,000; in spite of which fact our net import of gold reached the sum of $611,700,000 and of silver $18,170,000.
Commenting on the condition of trade and the business of the banks, Dun's Review says:

Most of the country's city managers were in St. Louis last week, attending their twenty-first annual convention. Theirs can hardly be called a new profession any longer.

THE Kingdom team of the Border Baseball League was trailing the leader by the trifling margin of thirty-one games early this month. So the manager resigned "in the best interests of the club."

Richard L. Neuberger, in "The Farmer Is Worried About His Future," implies that the farmer is having a mighty soft time of it. Yes, be is better off than he has been in a long time, but what other business could or would run year after year on the minute return on investment and labor that farming gives? The farmer works from sixty to seventy-five hours a week.

The map of crops appearing in connection with BERNHARD OSTROLENK'S understanding and comprehensive article in the Special Feature section of THE TIMES today on The Farmer's Plight (which urbanites especially should read) suggests what a long way we have traveled since the poor Greek farmer Heronax at the end of his harvest paid his homage to the goddess of agriculture and to the Seasons" whose feet are in the furrows."

OMAHA. SANDWICHED in between sighs for the things she wants and cannot have there is a song in the heart of the farm wife out in the wide open spaces. though you might not think so from the volume of quite unmusical sound that comes from this part of the country. But just to prove it here is what one of them writes after a day of cooking, cleaning and mending:
Professor SELIGMAN'S analysis of the farm problem takes note of several ways in which "the normal "level of opportunities and condi"tions as between agriculture and "industry has been distorted."
High prices for durable goods, from automobiles to sewing machines, have been the cause of much public lamentation. However, an automobile finance company in Minnesota made a survey not long ago which reveals that prices of foodstuffs from American farms reached an altitude, before the recent crack in the commodity markets, out of proportion to those at least of motor cars.
For the American farmer 1932 was a year of singular misfortune. Between Jan. 1 and mid-December average prices of agricultural products, as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, declined by 18.1 per cent, while the general price level was falling by only 7.8 per cent.
When the President spoke to the farmers of the country yesterday, through the American Farm Bureau Federation at Chicago, he was addressing a more satisfied audience than he would have found in the Corn Belt or the cotton country in the early days of his Administration.
The bill to forbid the sale of government-held crop surpluses at prices below "parity," which the Senate passed in disregard of the President's plea, is calculated to raise the cost of living $1,000,000,000. This is a serious matter for the consumers of the country.
Farmers in Eastern New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, reports Bernard Ostrolenk to this newspaper, are beginning to feel the backwash of the defense effort. They gain because the multifarious industries over the hill and down the road attract new employes, who have to eat.
Regions so far apart as Minnesota and South Africa have just witnessed a movement of the Farmer-Labor idea. A Farmer-Labor Convention at St. Paul has adopted a program which stands in great need of textual criticism before its precise meaning can be determined, but whose general intention is anti-capitalistic.
Basic to agricultural discontent in the Middle West is the feeling that the farmer has failed to obtain his just share of national prosperity. In its extreme form the statement runs that industrial well-being has been maintained at the expense of the farmer. Whether well founded here or not, it is a complaint seldom heard among the farming population of Europe, though with one notable exception.
While the farmer has been discovering the city, or at least the City of Washington, a widening group of cities in the Middle West have been discovering the farmer. They range from centres of some twenty-five thousand...

Farmer nightmares, on call for first instalment of N Y banks' subscription to assn to aid banks and farmers in Northwest
Is agriculture to get the adequate protection which the Republicans promised? Is it to be put on a level with other industries? The makers of the Senate bill tried, somewhat fumblingly, to increase the agricultural rates in the Hawley bill and to knock off its enlargements of Industrial rates.

The New York Farm Bureau Federation is giving light to the other farmers who think that the way to get service from the railways is to impoverish them. No farmer starves his beasts and expects them to draw heavier loads the less they are fed.
OMAHA, Oct. 18 -- There have been recent suggestions that isolation is wearing thin in the Middle West and speculation over how real that trend is and how far it has gone. For six or eight months there have been witnesses trying to say that it was very real indeed, but they haven't been taken very seriously until now.

It is comforting to know that there are still three members of Congress who had the fortune to be born in a log cabin. It is, or was once, the ideal start for a politician. Fifty-one members, a little less than a tenth, were born on a farm.
Senator BORAH'S speech at Minneapolis last week had the same theme as his previous radio address in Washington which stirred so ranch interest in Europe. He has got a new subject which perhaps no one else is so well fitted to lay before the American people. Mr. BORAH cannot now be suspected of partisan motives.
The Federal Reserve Bank is asking nobody to defend it against the attacks of former Controller of the Currency WILLIAMS, and personalities have no place in the Congressional inquiry. The questions raised involve both theory and practice of banking, and should be settled on principle. The charges are that the Federal Reserve...
Under the caption "Farmer Troubles and Remedies," you said that "each farmer can do most to help himself by acting individually, trusting individually, trusting not to tariffs or laws." That is precisely what farmers have been doing. Living isolated lives, as most of them do throughout the country, there is very little seen of concerted action.
Agriculture is our greatest interest. It is entitled to all consideration within reason. A representative conference of farmers and planters at Washington put themselves in a false position by going there and did not help their ...
The Advisory Council of the Federal Reserve is the highest authority of the country on matters of banking policy. The country is the worse for not having seen the railways' red light. Now it may profit by seeing the banking red light betimes.
Scarcity of supply brings higher prices, and no other sound way of making and keeping them, higher is known. Such movements as the farmers' holiday, now spreading through, the Middle West, are designed to promote scarcity. Hitherto the agrarian, effort has taken the form, of reducing the crop.
It is no small honor to aspire to be a colleague, however unworthy, of Senator BROOKHART. The term of Mr. STECK ends March 4, 1931. He is an amiable person, but on account of his politics the Republicans of the State regard him as what the archaeologists call an intrusive burial.

Announcement of the plan to turn over to home relief families vacant lots and other undeveloped land for the growing of vegetables for their own use is the most inspiriting Spring news. It is even on larger scale than last year and will provide 10,000 plots.

Too little is known in the East about Representative at Large TRUAX of Ohio. He is a specialist "in pure-bred Duroc Jersey hogs." He used to edit The Swine World.

The Federal Reserve law limits rediscounts to paper arising from "actual commercial transactions" for "agricultural, industrial or commer  cial" purposes. Agriculture was given first place, because not until after the war did industrial business reach first rank.
We ara not hearing so much just now about "America First." So far as that campaign claptrap meant anything at all to the ordinary mind, it implied that this country was to go it along, live off its own fat and keep foreign goods out by a high tariff. But that kind of America first is already beginning to appear too much...
Mr. EDISON proposed a special finance for the farmers because they got "skinned" through ignorance of figures. But their education is proceeding apace. Those wise in the ways of markets are advising holding crops for higher prices. This is the "conservative marketing" policy.

A Georgia newspaper, commenting on the cry from one of the counties of that big State for 1,000 more farmers, remarks that there are 146 counties in the State which need as many. The chance of getting farmers for the neglected Georgia lands is better than the chance of getting good farmers.

Secretary WILSON'S statement that the value of the year's harvest is "the most extraordinary total in the Nation's history" does not exhaust its significance. The manner in which the magnitude of the figures is reached rivals the total itself. To illustrate, the value of the potato crop is 18 per cent. above any former crop, but the quantity is 5 per cent. below the average.
Edwin T. Meredith, Secretary of Agriculture, was recently invited by a bankers' magazine to give his views and his ideas on what assistance the bankers of the country can give toward the farming industry. His reply was in letter form. He said:

President HARDING'S praise of the War Finance Corporation for aiding banking institutions, co-operative marketing organizations and exporters of farm products is deserved.
Our farmers, who are paying high and rising prices for all that they must buy, labor included, quite naturally object to a foodstuffs embargo designed to reduce the prices of what they have to sell. Their associations are beginning to make formal protest by resolutions and otherwise. One, whose 300,000 members are grain farmers, asserts that the proposed embargo would be class legislation.

MANY discussions assume that Washington's efforts to bring farm and other prices near together are an unheard-of departure. Several countries are trying experiments not much unlike ours, though less comprehensive. Holland fixes a price for hogs and issues a limited number of license tags to farmers, who must attach one to each animal offered for sale, thus preventing an overwhelming of the market.
WASHINGTON, July 9. -- On recommendation of Representative Bert Lord of New York, whose home district around Binghamton was one of those hardest hit, the Rural Resettlement Administration began working today on the problems of loans for seed, feed and housing in areas where plantings and crops were washed out by floods, and barns and homes wrecked.

NEWTON, N.J., July 25.--Jeremiah Cole, a well-to-do farmer living near Colesville, about twenty miles from here, committed suicide by hanging himself to the rafters in his barn early today.

The Democratic plank promising "a reduction of the tariff upon the necessaries of life" seems to us harmless, even admirable, but it is loaded and aimed at the heart which beats for the poor farmer. The above simple phrase being translated into a shorter and uglier form spells "free wool," and that means the enmity of that class for whose pennies Mr. BRYAN made such a heart to heart appeal the other day.
The farmers are said to be disappointing the expectations of their Democratic friend as to their contributions in aid of his campaign in their behalf. It would be odd if they should make a like response to the overtures of their Republican friend. No farmers are known to be asking anybody's favor in these golden days of agriculture, and nobody would have any patience with them if they were.

THE Hambletonian means nothing in the life of the city dweller, the troglodyte of the teeming turrets. But to the farmer in the dell -- and the farmers on a thousand hills -- the Hambletonian is the great sports event of the year. The harness horse and all its ways are truly rural.

Government financial aid for the farmer has long been a Populist doctrine in this country, and bankers, too, are giving attention to ways and means of extending and perfecting rural credits. These movements give particular interest to the experiments which the Government of Saxony is making in stimulating not only agricultural expansion, but the activities of small local manufacturers, through the agency of financial aid from the State.

President HILL of the Great Northern is a little loose in his calculation that $5,000 will "build" an agricultural school and that the cost of a battleship will maintain a thousand of such schools. But his notion of the relative value of the two expenditures is not far out of the way.

THE newly opened comprehensive exhibition of paintings and drawings by Van Gogh, at the Metropolitan Museum should prove to be a fairly definitive experience for the visitor. Except that, since the art world is very much alive, a constant process of revaluation necessarily goes on.
An intent crowd of nearly 2,000, including many teen-agers, visited the Vincent Van Gogh exhibition yesterday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the opening day of the largest Van Gogh show ever held in this country.
IN its current exhibition, "Modern Art in Your Life," the Museum of Modern Art, as part of its twentieth anniversary program, is in effect rather elaborately demonstrating a truism. That the life of a given time is necessarily reflected in its art, architecture, industrial design and in the make-up of a thousand things in daily living, it would seem, hardly needs to be said.
Natl Exhibition of Dinnerware Design winners noted; sponsored by Syracuse Fine Arts Museum and Commercial Decal
Whether or not the average citizen understands modern art and whether or not he likes it, he stumbles across myriad manifestations of it in the course of a day's existence. That is the theme of the exhibition, "Modern Art in Your Life," which opens today at the Museum of Modern Art.
As a part of its twentieth-anniversary program, the Museum of Modern Art will open to the public today an exhibition entitled "Modern Art in Your Life." It is less an art exhibition than a demonstration of a thesis which should not need demonstration, but which apparently does need to be reiterated at intervals -- that modern art is not an orphan stepchild of the life of our time, nor a product of spontaneous combustion.

WITH the acquisition of Picasso's "Three Musicians" (one of two versions painted in 1921, the other, slightly smaller, in the Gallatin Collection, Philadelphia Museum), the Museum of Modern Art is able to present to any skeptical visitor an extraordinary group of that controversial painter's major achievements.
THE retrospective exhibition of work by the Austrian expressionist Oskar Kokoschka which has opened at the Museum of Modern Art does considerably more than bring before us an artist's development.

The new film at the Mayfair, despite its unpromising title, is the bearer of a hearty thesis which it attacks with vigor and healthy malice. Swinging its punches up from the toes, it wades into the band of writers, artists and musicians who still cling to the fading Bohemianism of Greenwich Village. It places a well-timed bomb under the pallid cult below Fourteenth Street, which will fight to the death for its right to believe that clean shirts and haircuts are incompatible with high-minded artistic expression. If "I Believed in You" can be trusted, the Village tea-room brigade, reading their verses by candlelight and crying imprecations on the bourgeois mediocrities who traffic evilly with the publishers and producers, are men and women of small integrity and smaller talent.Being the dramatization of a point of view, the new film shrewdly manipulates its arguments, not to discover the median of truth, but to bludgeon a case for the prosecution. In the Village they will very likely laugh it down; at the Mayfair audiences applauded some of the anti-art-for-art's-sake speeches. At any rate, "I Believed in You" is a lively and interesting entertainment.True Merrill, in the story, is a girl who believes passionately in what the neo-expressionists among her village friends appear to stand for. Michael Harrison, a wealthy dilettante, represents everything in the corrupt world of bourgeois art that she abhors. She has come to New York from a mining town, lured by the angry, prophetic words of the labor agitator with whom she is in love. Stung by Harrison's sarcastic references to her friends, she accepts his chiding offer to let him finance the group for six months. He maintains that they will not only fail to produce anything of value, but will be wanting in ordinary gratitude. After the six months, even her lover, who seems incorruptible, has shown himself to be small and mean. Broken, she herself sells a first novel, declines Harrison's offer of marriage and determines to go on by herself.The actors who participate in this parable are good and the direction successfully avoids the temptation to belabor the theme with facile burlesque. Rosemary Ames, a charming and talented newcomer, gives an affecting performance as the girl, and she is excellently assisted by Victor Jory as the agitator and John Boles as the dilettante.The new film at the Mayfair, despite its unpromising title, is the bearer of a hearty thesis which it attacks with vigor and healthy malice.

TWO or three years ago I read in the annual announcement of a leading American magazine a paragraph asserting that the essay was regaining  its former popularity; and as I was myself an essayist by profession I rejoiced.
